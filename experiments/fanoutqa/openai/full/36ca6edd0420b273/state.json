He won 21 races with McLaren and has won 82 with Mercedes.\nLewis Hamilton holds the record for the most race wins in Formula One history, with 103 wins to date. Michael Schumacher, the previous record holder, is second with 91 wins, and Sebastian Vettel is third with 53 victories.[6][7] Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen holds the distinction of having the longest time between his first win and his last. He won his first Grand Prix at the 2003 Malaysian Grand Prix, and his last at the 2018 United States Grand Prix, a span of 15\u00a0years and 212\u00a0days.[8] Riccardo Patrese holds the record for the longest period of time between two race wins \u2013 more than six-and-a-half years between the 1983 South African Grand Prix and the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix.[9] Mario Andretti had to wait the longest time between his maiden victory at the 1971 South African Grand Prix and his second win \u2013 coming five years, seven months and 18 days later at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix.[10] Max Verstappen holds the record for the most consecutive wins, having won ten Grands Prix in a row in 2023.[11] Verstappen is also the youngest winner of a Grand Prix; he was 18 years and 228 days old when he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix.[12] Luigi Fagioli is the oldest winner of a Formula One Grand Prix; he was 53\u00a0years and 22\u00a0days old when he won the 1951 French Grand Prix.[13]\n\n\nAs of the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, out of the 775 drivers who started a Grand Prix,[14] there have been 113 Formula One Grand Prix winners.[15] The first Grand Prix winner was Giuseppe Farina at the 1950 British Grand Prix, and the most recent driver to score their first Grand Prix win is George Russell who took his first win at the 2022 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix.[15] Three Grands Prix, the 1951 French, the 1956 Argentine and the 1957 British Grand Prix, were won by two drivers sharing a car.[16]\n\n\nThis list includes the winners of the Indianapolis 500 race between 1950 and 1960, as they formed part of the World Championships, even though they were not run by Formula One regulations, nor are they referred to as Grands Prix.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## By

In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among others.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season\u2014to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\n\n\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles.\n\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of *Time* as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Hamilton, Lewis' father and then-manager, celebrating with his son after the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix[6]\nHamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.[2] His father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and from Birmingham,[7] making him mixed-race;[8] Hamilton has identified as black.[9] Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.[10] Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.[11][12] Hamilton was raised a Catholic.[13]\n\n\nHamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five.[14] Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition.[15] Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse.[14][16] Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school.[17] To support his son, Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents,[18] while still attending his son's races.[19] Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company.[20] He continued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.[21][22]\n\n\nHamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage.[23] Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school.[24] He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries.[25] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young.[20] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[26] In February 2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[27]\n\n\n\n## Junior racing career[edit]\n\n\n### Karting[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.[28][29] Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\"[18] Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\"[30] When Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25.[31] In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins,[15] to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren driver development programme.[8] The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.[28]\n\n\n\n> \n> He's a quality driver, very strong and only 16. If he keeps this up I'm sure he will reach F1. It's something special to see a kid of his age out on the circuit. He's clearly got the right racing mentality.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Michael Schumacher, speaking about Hamilton in 2001[32]\n\nHamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000.[33] In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.[34]\n\n\n\n### Formula Renault and Formula Three[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.[15] This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall.[35] He remained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.[36] Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship.[37] In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,[38] and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.[39]\n\n\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\".[40] He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.[41] He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix[42] and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.[43][44] Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[45] Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the team's young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a \"huge row\" at the end of the season, with Lewis' father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in F3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Lewis' contract; however, Lewis called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the team.[18]\n\n\nHamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone.[46] Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds.[15] He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.[47] After the season British magazine *Autosport* featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.[15]\n\n\n\n### GP2[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season.[48] Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Alexandre Pr\u00e9mat.[49] He secured a dominant win at the N\u00fcrburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.[50] At his home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.[51] In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.[52] Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.[53]\n\n\nHamilton's success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to Ferrari.[54][55] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.[56] He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.[57]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Lewis Hamilton\n\n### McLaren (2007\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n![A silver Formula One car driving around a corner.](image)Hamilton took his first Formula One win at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix in only his sixth Grand Prix.\nHamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton is the first and, as of 2023[update], the only black driver to race in the series.[58][59][60] After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point, including those for the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109). Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012.[61]\n\n\n\n![A group of people dressed in orange celebrate, with Hamilton in the middle wearing a baseball cap.](image)Hamilton and his team celebrate his maiden Formula One World Championship title in 2008.\nHamilton's success continued in 2008 as he amassed five victories and ten podium finishes. As the season reached its conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title between the home favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion in the last race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth position in the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history and to deny race-winner Massa the title by one point.[62][63] This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.[64]\n\n\n\n> \n> There are people that watch and say that I've never had a bad car. I can assure you I have. 2009's car [at McLaren] was very, very far off and was the worst car that I've had.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Hamilton, in comparing his seasons at McLaren in 2009 and Mercedes in 2022.[65]\n\nIn his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories. Hamilton entered the final round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to form for 2012. Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year, Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher.[66]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2013\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132016: Teammates with Rosberg[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Rosberg endured a tense rivalry in their time as teammates.\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble.[67][68] In his first season with the Silver Arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen,[69] alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[66]\n\n\nChanges to regulations for the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final race in Abu Dhabi: \"This is the greatest day of my life.\"[66] New driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton elected to drive under his old karting No. 44 for the remainder of his career.[70]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career No. 44. It was the first season since 1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field did not contain a car bearing the No. 1.[71] Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the title with three races to spare.[66] That year, Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One,[72][73] as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's engine failure in Malaysia in 2016 was a key moment in the Drivers' Championship fight.\nDespite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track, culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[74] Ultimately, a succession of poor starts from Hamilton early in the season and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia meant Rosberg took the title, which he successfully secured before announcing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.[66][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u20132020: Four titles in a row[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2018 season was the first time in the sport that two four-time World Champions (Hamilton and Vettel) competed for a fifth title.\nThe 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the \"Fight for Five\" by journalists and fans.[76][77][78] As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).[66][75] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[79]\n\n\nHaving signed a contract with Mercedes that lasted until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019.[80] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Bull of Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[81][82] After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole positions.[83] His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.[84]\n\n\nHamilton won his seventh drivers' title in 2020, equalling the record set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[85][86] Over the shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton took 11 wins (equalling his previous personal best, but in fewer races) including one in Portugal to break Schumacher's record of 91 wins.[87] He also took 14 podiums and 10 pole positions. Hamilton missed the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting COVID-19,[88] his first race absence since his debut in 2007.[89] Hamilton clinched the title at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix with three rounds to spare and ended the season 124 points clear of his team-mate, Bottas, who finished second in the standings.[90] Amid Formula One's *We Race as One* campaign and growing global support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Hamilton took the knee ahead of every race he entered and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Hamilton and Bottas' W11 cars also sported a black livery as a statement of Mercedes' commitment to diversity.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season: Title battle vs. Verstappen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Verstappen engaged in several on-track battles throughout the 2021 season. Pictured is the 2021 United States Grand Prix.\nEarly on in the 2021 season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen emerged as title favourites.[93] The pair frequently exchanged the championship lead throughout the season\u2014often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track\u2014and entered the last race in Abu Dhabi level on points. In Abu Dhabi, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the race, denying Hamilton his eighth title. During the season, Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 pole positions and 100 race wins, respectively.[94][95]\n\n\nThe season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi's decision to instruct only the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which eliminated any gap between the pair and allowed the Dutchman, running newly fitted soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton on his worn hard tyres.[96][97] Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident.[98] Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director,[99] with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that \"human error\" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, but also that the final standings \"are valid, final and cannot now be changed.\"[100] Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the season as \"one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history\", with Hamilton and Verstappen having \"been head and shoulders\u2014and a lot more\u2014clear of every other driver on the grid.\"[96]\n\n\n\n#### 2022\u20132023: First winless season in Formula One and Mercedes struggles[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton 2022](image)Hamilton during free practice at the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\nHamilton was partnered by George Russell for 2022, in place of the departing Bottas.[101] The season saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise ground effect to generate downforce. During pre-season testing in Bahrain, Mercedes introduced its \"zero sidepod\" car design, which was radically different to that of its competitors. The Mercedes W13 suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season which limited the car's potential;[102] at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the car \"undrivable\".[103] During the first half of the season, Hamilton was marginally low on points compared to Russell, despite having been involved in the development of the W13, he had to try on experimental car setups until the British Grand Prix. As his car development contributions were concluded, he was able to perform better. Hamilton scored more podium finishes and championship points than Russell during the second half of the season.[104] During the season Hamilton set records such as, most consecutive seasons with at least one podium finish, most consecutive seasons with at least one lap led, most races with a single constructor, most Q3 appearances, most top 10 finishes and most chequered flags reached at the Monaco Grand Prix, most podium finishes at a single circuit, most points scored at the Monza Circuit and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix.[105]\n\n\nBy the end of the season, Hamilton achieved nine podiums but failed to achieve a race win or pole position in a season for the first time in his Formula One career. He finished in sixth place in the drivers' championship, 35 points behind Russell, who finished fourth. But Hamilton managed to qualify on higher grid positions and scored more podium finishes than Russell.[106][107]\n\n\nMercedes started the 2023 season with concerns over their competitiveness, with Hamilton saying they were \"not where they wanted to be\" after preseason testing.[108] He finished fifth in the opening race in Bahrain, over 50 seconds behind the winner Verstappen.[109] Hamilton achieved his first podium of the season in Australia to extend his own record.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton during the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix After back to back podium finishes in Spain and Canada, he fought from seventh on the grid to take third place at his home race at Silverstone.[111][112][113]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix Hamilton qualified 0.003 seconds in front of Verstappen to take his 104th pole position and his first since 2021.[114]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2023, the day before the first practice session of the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract to remain with Mercedes through the 2025 season. George Russell also signed a two-year extension, retaining Mercedes' driver pair.[115] At the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton qualified fifth, but would finish the race in third after inheriting the position after Russell crashed out from third place on the last lap.[116]\n\n\n\n## Driver profile[edit]\n\n\n### Driving style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won by over a minute from second-place Nick Heidfeld at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid,[117] excelling across a wide range of areas.[118] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[119] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\"[120][121] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[120]\n\n\nHamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[122] Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of \"how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed\", highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.[18]\n\n\nHamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[123][124] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.\"[125] Ahead of the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said \"I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or physically.\"[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix in torrential rain, and compared the conditions to his victory at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[127][128] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[129] His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\":[130] despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place.[131][130][132][133][134] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton is the most successful British driver in Formula One history, and has won the British Grand Prix a record eight times.\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.\"[135] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[136] In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna's original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show *Top Gear*. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.[137][138]\n\n\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[139] Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\n> \n> As a driver he is absolutely outstanding \u2013 as good as there's ever been. Apart from the talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One. He is box office, 100 per cent.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015[140]\n\nHamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation,[141][142][130] and one of the greatest Formula One drivers.[143][144][145][146][147] Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[note 2] Jim Holden writing in *Autocar* suggests Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One, but one of the greatest British sportsmen.[156] Despite receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been under-appreciated.[157][158] Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance \u2013 being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing \u2013 alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[156] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[159][156]\n\n\n\n> \n> What strikes me now about him now is his maturity ... [Hamilton] recognises he is a role model and the influence he has and the responsibilities that come with it. He is far broader than purely a driver in [Formula One]. He has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. That is part of the greater appeal of Lewis today.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019[160]\n\nHamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised.[161] He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers.[162][159] Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[162] Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[157]\n\n\nFigures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport, noting how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[161] Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83\u00a0billion as of 31 July 2016.[141] Sports journalist for *The Telegraph*, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[163] Following Hamilton's knighthood in 2020,[164] newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton \"is a true giant of our sport\" and that \"his influence is huge both in and out of a car.\"[165]\n\n\n\n> \n> He was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017[166]\n\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\"[18] After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[20] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[167] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons,[144] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[166][168]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton waving to fans after winning the 2018 Italian Grand Prix\nAfter Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[142] an opinion which was widely accepted among the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[141] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history.[167] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[169][170] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike,[171][144][166][172][173][143][174][175][176][177] with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[178][179]\n\n\nFollowing Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[150] a sentiment echoed by his Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described him as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\",[157] while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described Hamilton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[117] After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.[153] Herbert compared Hamilton to tennis player Roger Federer and golfer Tiger Woods.[180]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's 2007 helmet\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[181] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach.[182] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[183] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time, on either side.[184] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's helmet in 2013\nHamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, he sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[186] At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought with him a striking blue-and-green design in honour of team sponsor Petronas but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[187] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words *World Champion*.[188] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title, towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[185] and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[189]\n\n\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[190] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career, saying: \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[191] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix.[192]\n\n\nHamilton switched into a different design in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in support of Black Lives Matter, he also continued to use the same design in 2021.[193] Hamilton wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in support of the LGBTQ+ community.[194] Ahead of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it also used purple details.[195] He also used one-off designs for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.[196][197][198] Hamilton retained the yellow helmet design in 2023.[199]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n#### Fernando Alonso[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alonso (left) and Hamilton (right) at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007.[200] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[201] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"[201]\n\n\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary.[18] Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[202] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[203] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[204] British motorsport journal *Autosport* claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[205] however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.[206]\n\n\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[207][208] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[209] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[210][211][212] Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[213] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[214] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[166] Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[143] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[215]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. Hamilton had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Alonso 10 times. Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of Hamilton only 7 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Nico Rosberg[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hamilton\u2013Rosberg rivalry\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Rosberg (right) at the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[217] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\"[218] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[218] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing.[20]\n\n\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability but with an intellect to match Rosberg's.[139] Buxton wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Man to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his tires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't used too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.[139]\n> \n> \n\n\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[20] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage.[139] However, Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.\"[118][219]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times. Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[220]\n\n\n\n#### Sebastian Vettel[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel 2017 United States GP (38000070491)](image)Hamilton (left) and Vettel (right) at the 2017 United States Grand Prix\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together.[221] After three years of Mercedes' dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018.[222][223][224][225] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty,[226] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight.[227][228][229] In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\n\n\n\n> Mine and Seb's battle were my favourite so far. It's knowing I was racing against an incredible driver, not only that but a great man in Seb who is a four-time world champion and we were racing against another team, he was at Ferrari who were very strong at the time. It took a lot out of both of us in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. That was a difficult period for us and it brought us closer, because the respect we have between us is huge.[230]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\n### Racist treatment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton was racially abused by fans during 2010 pre-season testing at Jerez.\nThe first and, as of 2023, the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix.[231] In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [*sic*]\".[232] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour,[233] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[234] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named *pinchalaruedadeHamilton*, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[235] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.[236]\n\n\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, *The Guardian* journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public.[237] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[238] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[239] and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport.[240] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[241]\n\n\n\n### Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n#### Diversity and anti-racism[edit]\n\n\n> \n> People come up to me from different ethnic backgrounds saying, \"My kid wants to be you one day\", and I can assure you that when I started racing, there weren't people from those [ethnic backgrounds]. I take great pride in that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Hamilton in 2017 commenting on his influence on minority representation in Formula One[242]\n\nHamilton is a prominent advocate against racism and for increased diversity in motorsport.[243][244] He has questioned racial politics in Formula One on several occasions. In 2011, after being summoned to the stewards in five out of the first six races of the season, Hamilton quipped, \"Maybe it's because I'm black, that's what Ali G says.\"[245] In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, describing how nothing had changed in his eleven years in the sport before saying: \"Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in.\"[246][247]\n\n\nHamilton took the knee before every race he entered in the 2020 Formula One season in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Following the murder of George Floyd while being arrested in May 2020, which sparked national and global protests,[248] Hamilton criticised prominent figures in Formula One for their silence on the issue, writing on Instagram:\n\n\n\n\n> I see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice. Not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport. I'm one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. ... I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can't stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are and I see you. ... I do not stand with those looting and burning buildings but those who are protesting peacefully. There can be no peace until our so called leaders make change. This is not just America, this is the UK, this is Spain, this is Italy and all over. ... The way minorities are treated has to change, how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.[249][250][251][252]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing Hamilton's comments, several drivers released statements about Floyd's murder and voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and support was expressed from other figures in the sport such as Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss.[253][249] Ross Brawn, managing director for Formula One, said that the organisation \"supports [Hamilton] totally\", describing Hamilton as \"a great ambassador for the sport\". He acknowledged that Hamilton's comments \"are very valid\" and that the sport \"can give greater opportunity for minority and ethnic groups to get involved in motorsport\". Brawn stated that Formula One was working to increase diversity within the sport, with efforts targeted at increasing driving opportunities at grassroots level as well as across all roles in Formula One.[254]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix weekend, including on the podium, Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing \"Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\" on the front and \"Say her name\" with a photo of Taylor on the back, in reference to the killing of Breonna Taylor. Following an investigation, the FIA announced that only race suits done up to the neck can be worn on the podium and that only official team attire can be worn in the media pen.[255] In anticipation of the FIA's decision, Hamilton said that he recognised that they have \"certain limits that they feel that they have to work within\", but he \"[didn't] regret a single moment of it\" and cited the \"really positive support from the fans\".[244]\n\n\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Hamilton had established The Hamilton Commission with the Royal Academy of Engineering. The commission had been in development since December 2019 but publicly launched to coincide with the heightened media and public interest in the Black Lives Matter movement, and greater scrutiny of race inequality in society. The partnership with the Royal Academy of Engineering was established to find ways in which motorsport can engage more young people from black backgrounds with science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects and, ultimately, employ them in motorsport or in other engineering sectors.[256][257] In May 2021, Hamilton become the first recipient of the inaugural Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year Award for his involvement in the fight against racism.[258]\n\n\nBuilding on the recommendations of the Hamilton Commission, Hamilton launched Mission 44, a charitable foundation created to help young people from under-represented backgrounds achieve their ambitions in wider society, in July 2021. Hamilton pledged \u00a320m of his personal wealth to support the work of the charity, including supporting organisations and programmes that narrow the gap in employment and education.[259] Mission 44 will work in conjunction with a joint charitable foundation between Hamilton and the Mercedes Formula One team, called Ignite, which was also launched in July 2021.[260] Ignite focuses on increasing diversity in motorsport, by improving educational opportunities and offering financial support.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hamilton confronted the Bahrain's human rights abuses and spoke out on the allegations of sportswashing. Hamilton said he \"won't let it go unnoticed\" after an 11-year-old boy, Ahmed Ramadhan, wrote a letter to Hamilton, asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty, after a confession was allegedly extracted through torture for the death of a policeman.[262][263] Hamilton spoke to human rights organisations and legal experts. He also spoke with Bahraini officials about the country's human rights. The F1 champion said that while he had no authority to choose the location for his race, \"going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places\" is not the right way.[264] In July 2021, Hamilton spoke out against the \"cowardly\" anti-LGBT laws in Hungary, after the country introduced a law that limits discussions of LGBT sexualities in school.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental and animal rights[edit]\n\n\nHamilton has repeatedly discussed environmental issues and animal rights at conferences, in interviews and in documentaries.[266][267] He also uses his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives,[268] which range from urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock,[269] and backing charities which fight the illegal wildlife trade,[270] to calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest.[271] In January 2020, he donated US$500,000 (approximately \u00a3383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the bushfire crisis in Australia.[272] The money went towards the fire services and animal welfare charities.[273]\n\n\nIn 2019, Hamilton asked Mercedes-Benz to swap animal-derived leather in the company's models worldwide: \"I am trying to push for sustainability with my team. I am trying to get\u00a0more involved in Formula 1 and be more conscious*.* Mercedes-Benz is a huge organisation. I have got a phone call with the CEO later today to discuss how we can work on getting rid of all the leather supplied to the cars. That is something I want to be involved in.\"[274][275] The next year, he announced his aim of being carbon neutral by the end of the year, saying: \"I don't allow anyone in my office, but also within my household, to buy any plastics. I want everything recyclable, down to deodorant, down to toothbrush, all these kinds of things ... I'm trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space. I sold my plane over a year ago. I fly a lot less now. I'm trying to fly less through the year.\"[276]\n\n\n\n#### UNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Hamilton began working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In March 2012, Hamilton travelled to the Philippines where he made a short film about Manila's street children. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid and helped raise over \u00a34.9 million for UNICEF.[277][278][279] In October 2012, while in India for the Grand Prix, Hamilton visited a UNICEF-funded newborn care unit and nutrition centre. Hamilton said: \"As a sportsman in the public eye, I know I have a role to play in helping to tell the stories of the world's most vulnerable children and I jumped at the chance to be able to do that again after a visit to Manila.\"[280][281][282]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hamilton travelled to Haiti where he made a short film about child malnutrition. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid, and helped raise over \u00a36 million for UNICEF.[283][284][285] In 2015, Hamilton took part in an exhibition to highlight UNICEF's work and to celebrate\u00a0its twenty-year partnership with Starwood Hotels.[286][287] In June 2017, Hamilton joined the Super Dads initiative, a special UNICEF campaign that highlighted the critical role played by fathers in early childhood development.[288][289][290] In August 2017, Hamilton visited Havana with UNICEF to learn more about its first development programmes in Cuba.[291][292]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hamilton partnered with charity campaign #TOGETHERBAND to help promote the United Nations' 17 Global Goals. As part of his campaign work, Hamilton visited Alperton Community School in North West London to speak to the students about the importance of education. Hamilton is a GOAL 4 Ambassador, focusing on the fight to provide quality education to all children.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other charities[edit]\n\n\nOver the past decade, Hamilton has made time for a variety of good causes, such as making hospital visits to sick children.[294][295] He has invited fans, young people, and their families to join him at Grand Prix races and social events.[296][297][298][299][300] In 2013, he became the Global Education Ambassador for Save the Children, supporting and promoting its education campaigns.[301][302][303] Two years later, Hamilton became the first ambassador for the Invictus Games Foundation, supporting wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.[304][305][306] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamilton's Neat Burger restaurant donated free meals to frontline NHS workers.[307][308] Neat Burger also launched the \"Kids Eat Free\" scheme, serving free meals to school children during the half-term break.[309][310]\n\n\nHamilton often donates personal and professional paraphernalia for charity auctions.[311][312][313][314] He auctioned a racing kart and raised over \u00a342,000 for baby charity Tommy's.[28] He raised \u00a36,411 for the Small Steps Project in 2018, and \u00a36,000 in 2019.[315] In 2020, he raised another \u00a34,000 for the Small Steps Project, while a donated race suit reportedly raised \u20ac20,000 for vulnerable children.[316][*citation needed*]\n\n\nHamilton frequently attends charitable functions[317][318][319][320] and has supported projects and charities such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation,[321] Comic Relief,[322] Rays of Sunshine,[323] Children in Need,[324] and Stevenage's Keech Hospice Care Children's Service, among others.[325] He is also involved in charitable work through the creation of his Lewis Hamilton Foundation. Registered in June 2008, the foundation provides grants and donations to a number of charitable causes.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Media reception[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and noted that people felt \"very offended\".[328] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[329] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[330]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Hamilton at Madame Tussauds, London\nHamilton's contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the *Powerlist*, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017.[331][332] In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th *Powerlist*, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement.[333][334] In 2020, he was listed as one of *Time* magazine's 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.[335][336][337]\n\n\nHamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.[338][339][340] That year, Hamilton received criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[341] Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying \u00a33.3\u00a0million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth \u00a316.5\u00a0million.[342] According to BBC *Panorama*, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be \"artificial\" and \"did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use\". The BBC also said that Hamilton's Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips.[342] The jet was sold in September 2019.[343] Despite not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told *The Sunday Times* in 2014: \"What people don't realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here [UK] as well. I am contributing to the country.\"[344][345]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nHamilton also has interests in music, saying that \"music has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don't get to see.\"[346] He features on Christina Aguilera's 2018 song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym XNDA, although he did not confirm this until July 2020, when he revealed he had been writing and recording music for ten years.[347][348] Hamilton also made a guest appearance in *Cars 2* (2011) in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself.[349] He then voiced a voice command assistant in *Cars 3* (2017).[350] Hamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film *The Game Changers*.[351] Hamilton has also revealed he was offered a role as a fighter pilot in the film *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) by Tom Cruise, but was forced to decline due to his Formula One commitments.[352]\n\n\nHe was also served as the \"maestro\" of the *Gran Turismo* series since *Gran Turismo Sport* in 2017[353] and his Time Trial Challenge DLC pack was released in that said game on 28 November 2019.[354]\n\n\nIn 2018, Hamilton launched the clothing line TOMMYXLEWIS during New York Fashion Week with American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin.[355] Hamilton stated \"[g]rowing up, I remember seeing the iconic Tommy Hilfiger flag\" and Hilfiger commented on Hamilton, saying that \"Lewis is bold in everything he does ... He's not afraid to take risks. And he has a cool and sophisticated style that really speaks to the new generation of Tommy fans.\"[356]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Hamilton launched a vegan restaurant named Neat Burger.[357] It claims to be the first international plant-based burger chain.[358] In 2020, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant of the Year at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards.[359] In August 2020, *Daily Front Row* listed Hamilton as one of a group of high-profile investors who purchased *W*, a troubled fashion magazine.[360] In 2021, for the second consecutive year, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards. Neat Burger was also named People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals's inaugural Company of the Year.[361]\n\n\nHamilton also became an Ambassador for the luxury watch company IWC, owned by Richemont. Throughout 2021, Hamilton toured the world via PORTL hologram, first in Europe and then making its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in September.[362]\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, Hamilton launched Team X44 to compete in the all-electric SUV off-road racing series Extreme E from the 2021 season on.[363] The X44 team finished 2nd in the inaugural Extreme E championship, behind Nico Rosberg's RXR team.[364] In January 2022, X44 were crowned inaugural winners of Extreme E Sustainability Award.[365] The team won the 2022 Championship in the final race of the season, beating RXR, who were disqualified from the race.[366]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Hamilton joined the newly-established ownership group of the National Football League's Denver Broncos.[367]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Hamilton founded the production company, Dawn Apollo Films. Its upcoming debut projects include an untitled sports action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski, and an untitled documentary film about Hamilton. Both projects will be co-produced by Hamilton, and released on Apple TV+.[368]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Epic Games added a cosmetic Hamilton player skin to *Fortnite*. A likeness of Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, was also added to the game.[369]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because \"[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world ... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"[370] In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism.[371] In 2018, Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\".[372] His racing number has always been 44 because when he started racing at age 8 his father's red Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate \"F44\" and it was his father's idea to use it.[373]\n\n\nHamilton is a fan of art and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol.[374] Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol's *Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe* painting hanging from a chain around his neck.[375] From November 2007 to February 2015, Hamilton was in an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl group Pussycat Dolls.[376][377]\n\n\nHamilton is a Catholic; he says that he prays regularly and is guided by his faith.[378] Hamilton believes that he has the \"hand of God\" resting over him when racing in Formula One.[379][380] Hamilton is also a supporter of LGBT rights, and strongly criticised the Hungarian government before the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix,[381] while also calling out the \"terrifying\" Saudi Arabian LGBT laws before that Grand Prix.[382]\n\n\nOn 14 March 2022, Hamilton revealed that he is in the process of legally changing his name to include his mother's maiden name, Larbalestier, as a middle name.[383] On 9 June 2022, Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil after a proposal made by politician Andr\u00e9 Figueiredo was passed in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.[384]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month after being caught speeding at 196\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph) on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded.[385][386] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\". After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (\u00a3288), being described as a \"hoon\" by the magistrate.[387][388][389]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton's rights management company 44IP opposed Swatch Group's application to register a trade mark for \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" in Europe for the sale of watches and timepieces. This was likely to have been encouraged, or even required, by Hamilton's own watch sponsor. 44IP alleged that Swatch Group's application was made in bad faith and that it was contrary to \"fair competition\" in relation to 44IP's existing \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" mark. In 2020, the case was heard before the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO rejected 44IP's arguments, ruling that there had been no bad faith by Swatch Group (with \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" having been used on relevant goods since 1892) and that 44IP's \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" trade mark did not extend to the word \"HAMILTON\" alone for the purposes of protecting the existing mark.[390]\n\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK. He later said on the television show *Parkinson* that taxation was also a factor in his decision.[391][392][393]\n\n\nIn 2010, Hamilton, like many other Formula One drivers, moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported \u00a310\u00a0million. Hamilton also owns an apartment in Manhattan, New York which he bought for US$40\u00a0million in 2017, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would live after his retirement.[394]\n\n\n\n### Wealth and income[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a388\u00a0million.[395] In 2018, it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of \u00a3159\u00a0million.[396] In 2020, Hamilton's fortune was an estimated \u00a3224 million, making him the richest British sports star in the history of the *Sunday Times Rich List*.[397]\n\n\nBefore the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix weekend, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One.[72] In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One.[79] According to *Forbes*, Hamilton was one of the highest-paid athletes of twenty-tens decade,[398] and also the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021.[399]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

Schumacher has a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Lewis Hamilton) and, at the time of his retirement from the sport in 2012, he held the records for the most wins (91), pole positions (68), and podium finishes (155)\u2014which have since been broken by Hamilton\u2014while he maintains the record for the number of total fastest laps (77), among others.\n\n\nBorn to working-class parents, Schumacher started his racing career in karting. He won his first karting championship aged six in a kart built from discarded parts. After having enjoyed success in karting\u2014such as winning the 1987 European karting championship\u2014and in several single-seater series, Schumacher made a one-off Formula One appearance with Jordan at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix. He was signed by Benetton for the rest of the 1991 season. He won his first and second drivers' titles consecutively in 1994 and 1995. Schumacher moved to the struggling Ferrari team in 1996. During his first years at the team, Schumacher lost out on the title in the final race of the season in 1997 and 1998 and suffered a broken leg from a brake failure in 1999. He and Ferrari won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004, including unprecedented sixth and seventh titles, breaking several records. After finishing third in 2005 and second in 2006, Schumacher retired from the sport, although he later made a brief return with Mercedes from 2010 to 2012.\n\n\nSchumacher was noted for pushing his car to the very limit for sustained periods during races, a pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him. He and his younger brother Ralf are the only siblings to win races in Formula One and the first siblings to finish first and second in the same race, a feat they repeated in four subsequent races. Schumacher was twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that decided the title: first with Damon Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, and later with Jacques Villeneuve at the 1997 European Grand Prix.\n\n\nAn ambassador for UNESCO, Schumacher has been involved in humanitarian projects and has donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. In December 2013, Schumacher suffered a severe brain injury in a skiing accident. He was placed in a medically induced coma until June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, before being relocated to his home to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher's title-winning German Formula Three car from 1990\nMichael Schumacher was born in the West German town of H\u00fcrth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3 January 1969, to working-class parents Rolf\u2014a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track\u2014and Elisabeth Schumacher (1948\u20132003), who operated the track's canteen.[1] When Schumacher was four, his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Michael crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts and, at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.[2]\n\n\nRegulations in Germany require a driver to be at least 14 years old to obtain a kart license. To get around this, Schumacher obtained a license in Luxembourg at the age of 12.[3] In 1983, he obtained his German license, a year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship. Schumacher joined Eurokart dealer Adolf Neubert in 1985 and by 1987, he was the German and European kart champion, then he quit school and began working as a mechanic. In 1988, he made his first step into single-seat car racing by participating in the German Formula Ford and Formula K\u00f6nig series, winning the latter.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, Schumacher signed with Willi Weber's WTS Formula Three team. Funded by Weber, he competed in the German Formula Three series, winning the title in 1990.[3] He also won the 1990 Macau Grand Prix under controversial circumstances. He placed second behind Mika H\u00e4kkinen in the first heat, three seconds behind. At the start of the second heat, he overtook H\u00e4kkinen, who only had to finish within three seconds of Schumacher to clinch the overall win. In the closing laps, Schumacher made a mistake, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to attempt to overtake. Michael changed his line immediately before H\u00e4kkinen did the same as the latter moved to overtake, and H\u00e4kkinen crashed into the back of Schumacher's car.[5] While H\u00e4kkinen's race was ended, Schumacher drove to victory without a rear wing.[6] Schumacher gave the prize money from winning the race to his family as they had debts.[7]\n\n\nDuring 1990, along with his Formula Three rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing programme in the World Sportscar Championship. This was unusual for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries competed in Formula 3000 on the way to Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long-distance races would help his career.[3] In the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season, Schumacher won the season finale at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez in a Sauber\u2013Mercedes C11, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship despite only driving in three of the nine races. He continued with the team in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in Japan with a Sauber\u2013Mercedes-Benz C291, leading to a ninth-place finish in the Drivers' Championship. He also competed at Le Mans during that season, finishing fifth in a car shared with Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In 1991, he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1991 430 km of N\u00fcrburgring, Schumacher was involved in an incident with Derek Warwick. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved his Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by Schumacher's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased Schumacher on foot. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from several mechanics and Schumacher's teammate Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.[8]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n### Profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"No one will ever be greater than Schumi. Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nToto Wolff about Schumacher[9]\n\n![](image)Schumacher (left) in 1991\nSchumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race and to push his car to the very limit for sustained periods.[10] He was also noted for his pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him.[11][12] In 2004, *Slate* magazine described Schumacher as \"the ultimate driving machine\" and \"the most dominant athlete in the world\" due to him having become \"quicker, stronger, and fitter than the competition by outworking them in the weight room\".[13] The magazine also stated that Schumacher changed the sport as he set a new benchmark for other drivers and built the team and technologies around him.[13] Schumacher exercised four hours a day, mostly to strengthen his neck muscles to better withstand G-forces during races.[14] After his gym session, he would often head to the race track for testing.[14] In 2003, Deutsche Welle highlighted Schumacher's \"natural talent\" for racing and his \"discipline and leadership\".[14] In 2023, former Formula One rival Giancarlo Fisichella noted that Schumacher \"did not even seem to have sweated\" during races, adding that Schumacher is the greatest Formula One driver of all time and \"rewrote the history of Formula One\".[15]\n\n\nIn 2003, *F1 Racing* magazine analysed Schumacher's driving style using telemetry data.[16] It was noted that Schumacher was \"very sensitively and flexibly\" on the gas and brakes. Compared with his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello, who often either braked or accelerated in a corner, Schumacher usually braked later into a corner and stabilised his car by accelerating slightly, often using both the brake and accelerator pedals at the same time. Exiting a corner, Schumacher accelerated considerably and balanced his car by braking lightly. With his driving style, Schumacher went 25 km/h faster through the hairpin corner of the Suzuka Circuit compared to Barrichello, who lost 0.3 seconds to Schumacher in this corner.[16] It was also noted that when needed, such as when the brakes started to overheat, Schumacher adapted his driving style to protect the brakes.[16]\n\n\n*Motor Sport* author Christopher Hilton observed in 2003 that a \"measure of a driver's capabilities is his performance in wet races, because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed\", and noted that like other great drivers, Schumacher's record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes: up to the end of 2003, Schumacher won 17 of the 30 races in wet conditions he contested.[17] Some of Schumacher's best performances occurred in such conditions, earning him the nicknames \"*Regenk\u00f6nig*\" (rain king)[18] or \"*Regenmeister*\" (rain master),[10] even in the non-German-language media. He is also known as \"the Red Baron\", because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German Manfred von Richthofen, the famous flying ace of the First World War. Schumacher's nicknames also include \"Schumi\",[19] \"Schuey\"[20] and \"Schu\".[21]\n\n\nSchumacher has often been credited with popularising Formula One worldwide, especially in Germany, where it was formerly considered a fringe sport.[7][22] In a 2006 FIA survey, he was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans.[23] Throughout his career, however, Schumacher was subject to anti-German prejudices, especially from the British media.[24] When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers in that year's Drivers' standings were German, more than any other nationality. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers.[25] In 2020, Vettel named Schumacher the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[26]\n\n\nDuring a large part of his Formula One career, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[27] In 2006, Formula One rival David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of the sport, while three-time World Champion Niki Lauda stated: \"He is the greatest. Nobody will ever beat him, as long as we are alive\".[28] In 2020, Schumacher was voted the most influential person in Formula One history.[29]\n\n\n\n### Jordan (1991)[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut.[30]\n\n\nThe week before the race, Schumacher impressed Jordan designer Gary Anderson and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at Silverstone. Schumacher's manager Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit, but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, by cycling around the track on a fold-up bike he brought with him.[31] He impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh. This matched the team's season-best grid position, and Schumacher out-qualified veteran de Cesaris. *Motor Sport* journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying \"clumps of German journalists were talking about 'the best talent since Stefan Bellof'\".[32] Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems.[33]\n\n\n\n### Benetton (1991\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix\nFollowing his Belgian Grand Prix debut, and despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by Benetton-Ford for the next race. Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 1991\u20131993[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished the 1991 season with four points out of six races. His best finish was fifth in his second race, the Italian Grand Prix, in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three-time World Champion Nelson Piquet.[35]\n\n\nAt the start of the 1992 season the Sauber team, planning their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton; Peter Sauber stated that \"[Schumacher] didn't want to drive for us. Why would I have forced him?\".[36] The year was dominated by the Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, featuring powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car's ride height.[37] In the \"conventional\" Benetton B192, Schumacher took his place on the podium for the first time, finishing third in the Mexican Grand Prix. He went on to take his first victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, in a wet race at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, which by 2003 he would call \"far and away my favourite track\".[38] He finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1992 with 53 points, three points behind runner-up Patrese and three in front of the Brazilian Ayrton Senna.[39] According to Jo Ram\u00edrez, a close friend of Senna, the Brazilian considered Schumacher \"the next big threat, way ahead of all the other drivers around at the time\".[24]\n\n\nThe Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost also dominated the 1993 season. Benetton introduced their own active suspension and traction control early in the season, last of the frontrunning teams to do so.[40] Schumacher won one race, the Portuguese Grand Prix where he beat Prost, and had nine podium finishes, but retired in seven of the other 16 races.[41] He finished the season in fourth, with 52 points.[42]\n\n\n\n#### 1994\u20131995: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher drove the Benetton B194 to his first World Championship in 1994.\nFile:Michael Schumacher 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.jpgSchumacher on the podium at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\nSchumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994. The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Senna\u2014witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind Senna\u2014and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.[43][44]\n\n\nSchumacher won six of the first seven races and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race. Schumacher made two pitstops without stalling and finished the race in second place. Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen.[45][46] Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of \"launch control\" that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used.[47]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was penalised for overtaking Hill on the formation lap. He and Benetton then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team.[48] Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed.[49] Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block.[50]\n\n\nThese incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36, Schumacher hit the guardrail on the outside of the track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire.[51] As a result, Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship, the first German to do so\u2014Jochen Rindt was German but raced under the Austrian flag. The race stewards judged it as a racing accident and took no action against either driver but public opinion was divided over the incident and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.[52][53][54] At the FIA conference after the race, Schumacher dedicated his title to Senna.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1995 British Grand Prix\nIn 1995, Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton, which now had the same Renault engine as Williams; according to *Motor Sport* author Marcus Simmons, Benetton had the better team, while Williams had the superior car.[56] Schumacher accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Hill. With teammate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship, breaking the dominance of McLaren and Williams, and became the youngest two-time World Champion in Formula One history.[57] The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the British Grand Prix on lap 45, and again on lap 23 of the Italian Grand Prix. Schumacher won 9 of the 17 races, and finished on the podium 11 times. Only once did he qualify worse than fourth; at the Belgian Grand Prix, he qualified 16th, but nevertheless went on to win the race.[58]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1996\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.[59] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari.[60]\n\n\nFerrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles labels such as \"truck\", \"pig\", and \"accident waiting to happen\".[61] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.[22] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.[62] However, Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship,[63] although afterwards, his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 \"an awful car\", a \"piece of junk\", and \"almost undriveable\", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car \"wasn't very good\".[64] During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.[65]\n\n\nSchumacher, Brawn, Byrne, and Jean Todt, have been credited as turning the struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history.[66][67] Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believed the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.[68]\n\n\n\n#### 1996\u20131999[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It was not a race. It was a demonstration of brilliance.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nStirling Moss about Schumacher at the 1996 Spanish GP[69]\n\nSchumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1996 and helped Ferrari to second place in the Constructors' Championship ahead of his old team Benetton. During the season, the car had reliability problems; Schumacher did not finish in 7 of the 16 races. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher took pole position, but suffered engine failure on the formation lap.[70] He won three races, however, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet.[3] Having taken the lead on lap 19, he consistently lapped five seconds faster than the rest of the field in the difficult conditions.[65] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher used well-timed pit-stops to fend off Williams' Jacques Villeneuve. Schumacher also took first place at Monza to win in front of the tifosi (Ferrari fans).[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher celebrates a second-place finish at the 1997 German Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher battles with David Coulthard at the 1998 British Grand Prix.\nMichael Schumacher and Villeneuve competed for the title in 1997. Villeneuve, driving the superior Williams FW19, led the championship in the early part of the season.[72] By mid-season, however, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix at Jerez with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he might not finish the race.[73] As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival on lap 48, Schumacher turned in on him but retired from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. The race stewards did not initially award any penalty, but two weeks after the race Schumacher was disqualified from the entire 1997 Drivers' Championship after an FIA disciplinary hearing found that his \"manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although deliberate not made with malice or premeditation, it was a serious error.\"[74][75] Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake.[74][76] His actions were widely condemned in British, German, and Italian newspapers.[52][76]\n\n\nIn 1998, Finnish driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen became Schumacher's main title rival. H\u00e4kkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16-point advantage over Schumacher. Schumacher then won in Argentina and, with the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes. One of his victories was at the Hungaroring, a track where overtaking is difficult; Schumacher drove 19 consecutive qualifying-like laps to make Brawn's alternative strategy work and to go from third to first place.[77] Ferrari took a 1\u20132 finish at the French Grand Prix, the first Ferrari 1\u20132 finish since 1990, and the Italian Grand Prix, which tied Schumacher with H\u00e4kkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points. H\u00e4kkinen won the Championship, however, by winning the final two races. There were two controversies during the season; at the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start-finish line and stopped to serve his ten-second stop-go penalty (received for overtaking a lapped car (of Alexander Wurz) during a safety car period). There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but, because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane, the win was valid.[78] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed on the racing line in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. His Ferrari lost a wheel but could return to the pits, although he was forced to retire. Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of \"trying to kill\" him.[79] Coulthard admitted five years later that the accident had been his mistake.[79]\n\n\nIn 1999, Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors' title. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the British Grand Prix at the high-speed Stowe Corner; his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track into the barriers and resulting in a broken leg.[80] During his 98-day absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo. After missing six races, he made his return at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix, qualifying in pole position by almost a second. He then assumed the role of second driver, helping Irvine to victory and assisting his teammate's bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari.[81] Irvine stated: \"He [Schumacher] is not only the best driver in the world, he is also the best number two in the world\".[82] However, in the last race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix, H\u00e4kkinen won his second consecutive title. Schumacher later said that H\u00e4kkinen was the opponent he respected the most.[83]\n\n\n\n#### 2000\u20132004: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher won his fourth World title in 2001.\n![](image)Schumacher driving the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro F2002 at the 2002 French Grand Prix, the race at which he clinched the 2002 Drivers' Championship, setting the record for the fewest races in locking up the title\nSchumacher won his third World Drivers' Championship in 2000, and his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with H\u00e4kkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to close the gap in the standings. H\u00e4kkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix. At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins (41) won by his idol Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[84] The championship fight would come down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to H\u00e4kkinen at the start. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came out ahead of H\u00e4kkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship.[85] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as H\u00e4kkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that \"the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest\" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was \"the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year\". Benson also hailed Schumacher as \"unquestionably the greatest driver of his era\".[86]\n\n\nIn 2001, Schumacher took his fourth Drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the Canadian Grand Prix, where Schumacher finished second to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first-ever 1\u20132 finish by brothers in Formula One;[87] and the Belgian Grand Prix, in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins.[88]\n\n\nIn 2002, Schumacher retained his Drivers' Championship. There was some controversy, however, at the Austrian Grand Prix. His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was leading, but in the final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.[89] Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or technical regulation, it angered fans and it was claimed that the team's actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators. Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be \"given\" wins in only the sixth race of the season, particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step,[89] and for this disturbance, the Ferrari team incurred a US$1 million fine.[90] At the United States Grand Prix later that year, Schumacher returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by the second-closest margin in Formula One history of 0.011 seconds on the finishing line.[91] Schumacher's explanation varied between it being him \"returning the favour\" for Austria, or trying to engineer a formation finish\u2014a feat derided as near-impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second.[92] After the end of the season, the FIA banned \"team orders which interfere with the race result\",[93][94] but the ban was lifted for the 2011 season because the ruling was difficult to enforce.[95] In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion.[96] Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning 11 times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Barrichello. This pair finished nine of the 17 races in the first two places.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Indianapolis in 2004, where he won the 2004 United States Grand Prix\nSchumacher broke Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in 2003, after a closely contested battle with his main rivals. Before the season started, the FIA introduced new regulations and a new points system to make the championship more open.[98] The biggest competition came from the McLaren-Mercedes and Williams-BMW teams. In the first race, Schumacher was run off track, and in the following two, was involved in collisions.[99][100][101] He fell 16 points behind McLaren's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Schumacher won the San Marino Grand Prix\u2014despite the death of his mother Elisabeth just hours before the race[102]\u2014and the next two races and closed within two points of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Aside from Schumacher's victory in Canada and Barrichello's victory in Britain, the mid-season was dominated by Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, who each claimed two victories. After the Hungarian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher led Montoya and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by only one and two points, respectively. Ahead of the next race, the FIA announced changes to the way tyre widths were to be measured: this forced Michelin, supplier to Williams and McLaren among others, to rapidly redesign their tyres before the Italian Grand Prix.[103] Schumacher, running on Bridgestone tyres, won the next two races. After Montoya was penalised in the United States Grand Prix, only Schumacher and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen remained in contention for the title. At the final round, the Japanese Grand Prix, Schumacher needed only one point whilst R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen needed to win. By finishing the race in eighth place, Schumacher took one point and assured his sixth World Drivers' title, ending the season two points ahead of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen.[104]\n\n\nIn 2004, Schumacher won a record 12 of the first 13 races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Montoya during a safety car period. Schumacher clinched a record seventh Drivers' title at the Belgian Grand Prix. He finished the season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up Barrichello, and set a new record of 13 race wins out of a possible 18, surpassing his previous best of 11 wins from the 2002 season.[105]\n\n\n\n#### 2005\u20132006: rule changes and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher battling with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen during the 2005 Canadian Grand Prix\nRule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race,[106] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres.[107] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting.[22] The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault's Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind Alonso.[108] Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher stated: \"I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more. It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon. If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance.\"[109] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix. Before that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap, leaving only six drivers on the grid.[110] Schumacher retired in 6 of the 19 races, and finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso.[111]\n\n\n2006 became the last season of Schumacher's Ferrari career. After three races, Schumacher had just 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races; his pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12-year-old record.[112] Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and started the race at the back of the grid, as he stopped his car and blocked part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to work his way up to fifth place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit. By the Canadian Grand Prix, the ninth race of the season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the following three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After further victories in Italy and China, Schumacher led in the championship standings for the first time during the season.[113] After his win in Italy, Ferrari issued a press release stating that Schumacher would retire from racing at the end of the 2006 season, but would continue working for the team.[114] The tifosi and the Italian press, who did not always take to Schumacher's relatively cold public persona, displayed an affectionate response after he announced his retirement.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher overtakes Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen for fourth with three laps to go of his final race for three years at Interlagos, having dropped to 19th early on.\nSchumacher led the Japanese Grand Prix; with only 16 laps to go, his car suffered an engine failure for the first time since the 2000 French Grand Prix, handing Alonso the victory.[116] During the pre-race ceremonies of the season's last race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, former football player Pel\u00e9 presented a trophy to Schumacher for his achievements in Formula One.[117][118] A fuel pressure problem prevented Schumacher from completing a single lap during the third qualifying session, forcing him to start the race in tenth position.[119] Early in the race, Schumacher moved up to sixth place but suffered a puncture caused by the front wing of Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault.[120] Schumacher fell to 19th place, 70 seconds behind teammate and race leader Felipe Massa. Schumacher recovered and overtook both Fisichella and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to secure fourth place. His performance was classified in the press as \"heroic\",[121] an \"utterly breath-taking drive\",[122] and a \"performance that ... sums up his career\".[123]\n\n![](image)BMW Sauber with \"Thanks Michael\" messages towards Michael Schumacher on the back of their cars. Schumacher and Peter Sauber worked together in sports cars before entering F1 in 1992.\n#### 2007\u20132009: new roles at Ferrari, motorcycle racing and injury[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Finali Mondiali celebrations in the F2007\nDuring the 2007 season, Schumacher acted as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's 'super assistant'.[124] Schumacher also helped Ferrari with their development programme at the Jerez circuit. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 Formula One season.[125] During 2008, Schumacher also competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series. At a Superbike cup race at the Pann\u00f3nia-Ring, Schumacher finished third out of twenty-seven\u2014behind professional motorcycle racers Martin Bauer and Andreas Meklau\u2014riding a Honda CBR1000RR.[126]\n\n\nAt the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Ferrari's Felipe Massa was seriously injured after being struck by a suspension spring during qualifying. Ferrari announced that they planned to draft in Schumacher for the European Grand Prix and subsequent Grands Prix until Massa was able to race again.[127] Schumacher tested a modified Ferrari F2007 to prepare himself as he had been unable to test the 2009 car due to testing restrictions.[128] Ferrari appealed for special permission for Schumacher to test in a 2009 spec car, but Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso were against this test.[129][130] In the end, Schumacher was forced to call off his return due to the severity of the neck injury he had received in a motorcycle accident earlier in the year.[131] Massa's place was instead filled by Luca Badoer and, later, Giancarlo Fisichella.[132]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2010\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"He played a crucial role when we re-joined F1 and was one of the people who laid the foundation for our future success. We're extremely grateful for everything he did for us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nMercedes' team principal Toto Wolff about Schumacher's influence on the Mercedes team[133]\n\nIn December 2009, Schumacher announced his return to Formula One for the 2010 season alongside fellow German driver Nico Rosberg in the new Mercedes GP team.[134] Mercedes returned to the sport as a constructor for the first time since 1955. Schumacher stated that his preparations to replace the injured Massa had initiated a renewed interest in Formula One, which, combined with the opportunity to fulfil a long-held ambition to drive for Mercedes and to be working again with team principal Ross Brawn, led Schumacher to accept the offer once he was passed fit.[134][135] Schumacher signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth \u00a320 million.[134] He turned 41 in 2010 and his prospects with Mercedes were compared with Juan Manuel Fangio, Formula One's oldest champion who was 46 when he won his fifth title.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2010: return from retirement[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished sixth in the first race of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He finished behind teammate Rosberg in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races; former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher might be \"past it\".[136] Several other former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned \"you should never write Schumacher off\".[137] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties.[138] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's car was designed for him, as he would initially drive for the team, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties.[139]\n\n\nMercedes upgraded their car for the Spanish Grand Prix where Schumacher finished fourth. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher finished sixth after passing Ferrari's Fernando Alonso on the final corner before the finish line when the safety car returned to the pits. Mercedes held that \"the combination of the race control messages 'Safety Car in this lap' and 'Track Clear' and the green flags and lights shown by the marshals after safety car line one indicated that the race was not finishing under the safety car and all drivers were free to race.\"[140] However, an FIA investigation found Schumacher guilty of breaching safety car regulations and awarded him a 20-seconds penalty, dropping him to 12th.[141] In Turkey, Schumacher qualified fifth, and finished fourth in the race, both his best results since his return. At the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Schumacher finished 15th, the lowest recorded finish in his career.[142] In Hungary, Barrichello attempted to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare.[143][144] Schumacher was found guilty of dangerous driving and was demoted ten places on the grid for the following race, the Belgian Grand Prix, where he finished seventh despite starting 21st after his grid penalty. At the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Schumacher was involved in a major accident on the first lap, after Vitantonio Liuzzi's car collided with Schumacher's, barely missing his head.[145][146] Schumacher finished the season in ninth place with 72 points. For the first time since 1991, Schumacher finished a year without a win, pole position, podium or fastest lap.[147]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher finished fourth in the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSchumacher's first points of 2011 were scored in Malaysia where he finished ninth; he later came sixth in Spain and took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, after running as high as second in a wet race.[148] Despite starting last in Belgium, Schumacher finished fifth. The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher lead three laps during the race, marking the first time he had led a race since 2006.[149] In doing so, he became the oldest driver to lead a race since Jack Brabham in 1970.[150] Schumacher finished the season in eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with 76 points.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher qualified fastest at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher at the 2012 US Grand Prix\nHe was again partnered by Rosberg at Mercedes for the 2012 season.[152] Schumacher retired from the season's inaugural Australian Grand Prix, and scored a point in the second round in Malaysia.[153] In China, Schumacher started on the front row, but retired due to a loose wheel after a mechanic's error during a pit stop.[154] After causing a collision with Bruno Senna in Spain, Schumacher received a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix. Schumacher was fastest in qualifying in Monaco but started sixth owing to his penalty.[155] He later retired from seventh place in the race.[156] At the European Grand Prix, Schumacher finished third, his only podium finish since his return to Formula One. At 43 years and 173 days, he became the oldest driver to achieve a podium since Jack Brabham's second-place finish at the 1970 British Grand Prix. In Germany, Schumacher set the fastest lap for the 77th time in his career, and in Belgium he became the second driver in history to race in 300 Grands Prix.[157]\n\n\nSchumacher's indecision over his future plans led to him being replaced by Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes for the 2013 season.[158] In October 2012, Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time,[159] stating: \"There were times in the past few months in which I didn't want to deal with Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix.\"[160] He concluded the season with a seventh-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix; Schumacher placed 13th in the 2012 Drivers' Championship.[161]\n\n\n\n## Helmet[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact.[162] The helmet kept the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.[163] Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals. On the top was a blue circle with white astroids.[164] From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello\u2014whose helmet was predominantly white with a blue circle on top and a red ellipsis surrounding the visor\u2014Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red.[165] For the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories.[166] At the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet, which included the year of his debut and the seasons of his seven World Driver's titles.[167] During his 300th Grand Prix appearance, at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher wore a platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.[168]\n\n\n\n* ![Helmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.](image)\n\nHelmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.\n* ![Bell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.](image)\n\nBell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.\n* ![Schuberth helmet for the 2002 season (Ferrari); at the 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix, Schumacher switched his helmet from Bell to Schuberth, though there was a contract with Bell for the 2001 season.

In 1992, the German Motor Sport Federation awarded him the ONS Cup, the highest accolade in German motorsport; he also won the trophy in 1994, 1995 and 2002.[169] In 1993, he won a Bambi Sports Award and was the first racing driver to receive the Golden Steering Wheel.[170][171] In 1994 and from 2001 to 2003, Schumacher was voted European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association.[172] He was voted Polish Press Agency (PAP) European Sportsperson of the Year from 2001 to 2003.[173] In 1995 and from 2000 to 2002, he was named Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year.[174][175] Schumacher was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1995 and 2004.[176] During the latter year, he was voted Germany's greatest sportsperson of the 20th century, beating Birgit Fischer and Steffi Graf to the accolade.[177] For his sports achievements and his commitment to road safety, Schumacher was awarded Germany's highest sporting accolade, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in 1997.[178] In 2002, for his contributions to sport and his contributions in raising awareness of child education, Schumacher was named as one of the UNESCO Champions for Sport.[179]\n\n\nSchumacher won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2002 and 2004,[180] received the Marca Leylenda award in 2001,[181] was named L'\u00c9quipe Champion of Champions three times (from 2001 to 2003),[182] won the Gazzetta World Sports Award twice (2001 and 2002),[183] and won the 2003 Lorenzo Bandini Trophy.[184] In honour of Schumacher's racing career and his efforts to improve road safety and the sport, he was awarded an FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport in 2006.[185] The same year, ahead of his final race for Ferrari at Interlagos on 22 October, football player Pel\u00e9 presented a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" to Schumacher.[186] A year later, in 2007, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport for his sporting prowess and his humanitarian record.[187] Together with Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher won the Race of Champions Nations' Cup six times in a row for Germany, from 2007 to 2012.[188] In 2017, Schumacher was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame and Germany's Sports Hall of Fame.[189][190] In 2020, Jean Todt honoured Schumacher with the FIA President Award, in recognition of Schumacher's seven World Championships and the \"inspiration his sporting and personal commitments brought to the world\".[191]\n\n\nIn Sarajevo, Schumacher was granted honorary citizenship,[192] while the Assembly of the Sarajevo Canton renamed major city transversal street after him,[193] and earlier a large street mural was painted in a city neighborhood of Dobrinja by a group of artists.[194] Honorary citizenship was also granted by Maranello, Modena and Spa.[195][196][197] He was appointed Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur,[198] was honoured with the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic,[199] and was appointed an ambassador of San Marino.[200] In 2008, the Swiss Football Association appointed Schumacher as the country's ambassador for UEFA Euro 2008, hosted by Switzerland and Austria.[201] In recognition of his contribution to Formula One, the N\u00fcrburgring circuit renamed turns 9 and 10 as the \"Schumacher S\", in 2007.[202] In 2014, the first corner of the Bahrain International Circuit was renamed in honour of Schumacher.[203] He received the State Prize of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2022.[204]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1995, Michael married Corinna Betsch.[205] They have two children, a daughter Gina-Maria (born 20 February 1997) and a son, Mick (born 22 March 1999). Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight.[205] From late 1991 until May 1996, Schumacher resided in Monaco. The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump.[206] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland.[207] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers.[208] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007.[1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season.[209]\n\n\nBefore his skiing accident, his main hobbies included horse riding, motorcycle racing, sky diving, and he played football for his local team FC Echichens.[210][211] Schumacher appeared in several charity football games,[212][213] and organised games between Formula One drivers.[214] He is a supporter of 1. FC K\u00f6ln, his local football club from where he grew up, citing Pierre Littbarski and Harald Schumacher as his idols.[215] He is a Roman Catholic.[216]\n\n\nIn 2006, Schumacher had a voice role in the Disney/Pixar film *Cars*. His character is himself as a Ferrari F430 who visits the town of Radiator Springs to get new tires from Luigi and Guido at the recommendation of Lightning McQueen. During arrival, Luigi and Guido both faint in excitement when they see him. The French film *Asterix at the Olympic Games* features Schumacher in a cameo role as a chariot driver called Schumix. In 2009, Schumacher appeared on the BBC's motoring programme *Top Gear* as the Stig.[217] Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, which the BBC subsequently confirmed. Schumacher was there because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the unique black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show.[218] In July 2021, Netflix announced the first officially approved documentary film about Schumacher\u2014called *Schumacher*\u2014which was released on 15 September 2021.[219]\n\n\nSchumacher was a special ambassador to UNESCO and has donated 1.5 million euros to the organisation.[220] Additionally, he paid for the construction of a school for poor children and for area improvements in Dakar, Senegal. He supported a hospital for child victims of the siege in Sarajevo, which specialises in caring for amputees.[221] In Lima, Peru, he funded the \"Palace for the Poor\", a centre for helping homeless street children obtain an education, clothing, food, medical attention, and shelter. Schumacher told *F1 Magazine*: \"It's great if you can use your fame and the power your fame gives you to draw attention to things that really matter\".[222] For the 2002 and 2013 European flood disasters, Schumacher donated 1 million and 500,000 euros, respectively.[223][224] He donated $10 million for aid after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake,[225] which surpassed that of any other sports person, most sports leagues, many worldwide corporations and even some countries.[226] From 2002 to 2006, he donated at least $50 million to various charities.[227] In 2008, he donated between $5M and $10M to the Clinton Foundation.[228]\n\n\nSince his participation in an FIA European road safety campaign, as part of his punishment after the collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix, Schumacher continued to support other campaigns, such as Make Roads Safe, which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the United Nations to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue. In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible drinking. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the world.[229]\n\n\n\n### Finance and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher was an advertising partner for watchmaker Omega. When he won his third title in 2000, which was the first with Ferrari, the *Speedmaster Racing* was issued in a *Schumacher Edition* having his signature on the back.\nIn 1999 and 2000, *Forbes* magazine listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world.[230] In 2005, *EuroBusiness* magazine identified Schumacher as the world's first billionaire athlete.[231] In 2005, *Forbes* ranked him 17th in its \"The World's Most Powerful Celebrities\" list.[232] A significant share of his income came from advertising; Deutsche Verm\u00f6gensberatung paid him $8 million over three years from 1999 for wearing a 10 by 8 centimetre advertisement on his post-race cap.[233] In 2010, his personal fortune was estimated at \u00a3515 million.[234] In 2017, *Forbes* designated Schumacher as the athlete with the fifth highest career earnings of all-time.[235]\n\n\n\n### 2013 skiing accident[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above M\u00e9ribel in the French Alps. While crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit,[236][237] he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet. According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet.[238] He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where he underwent two surgical interventions.[239] Schumacher was put into a medically induced coma because of traumatic brain injury.[240][241] By March 2014, there were small encouraging signs, and in early April he was showing moments of consciousness as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma.[242]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Schumacher left Grenoble Hospital for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland.[243] In September 2014, Schumacher left the hospital and was brought back to his home for further rehabilitation.[244] Two months later, it was reported that Schumacher was \"paralysed and in a wheelchair\"; he \"cannot speak and has memory problems\".[245] In May 2015, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm stated that his condition was slowly improving \"considering the severeness of the injury he had\".[246]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Felix Damm, lawyer for Schumacher, told a German court that his client \"cannot walk\", in response to reports from December 2015 in German publication *Die Bunte* that he could walk again.[247] In July 2019, former Ferrari manager Jean Todt stated that Schumacher was making \"good progress\" but also \"struggles to communicate\". Todt also said that Schumacher was able to watch Formula One races on television at his home.[248] In September of that year, *Le Parisien* reported that Schumacher had been admitted to the H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou in Paris for treatment by cardiovascular surgeon Philippe Menasch\u00e9, described as a \"pioneer in cell surgery\". Following the treatment, which involved him receiving an anti-inflammatory stem cell perfusion, medical staff stated that Schumacher was \"conscious\".[249]\n\n\nSchumacher's family maintains strict privacy about his condition; as of 2023[update] he has not been seen in public since the accident. In April 2023, *Die Aktuelle* published a \"first interview\" with Schumacher with \"quotes\" about his health and family, but it emerged that these responses had been invented by generative artificial intelligence. Schumacher's family said that they would sue the magazine, which sacked the editor responsible.[250][251]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

Vettel is one of the most successful drivers in Formula One history and has won four World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2010 to 2013. Vettel holds the record for being the youngest World Champion in Formula One. He also has the third-most race victories (53) and podium finishes (122), and fourth-most pole positions (57).[4][5][6]\n\n\nVettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off racing appearance in 2007. As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008, where he scored a victory in the Italian Grand Prix to become the then-youngest race winner. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the sport's youngest World Champion. In 2013, he set the then-record for the most consecutive race wins with nine.[7] Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 replacing Fernando Alonso and became Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished both years as runner-up. He parted ways with Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season to race with Aston Martin for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, before retiring from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nVettel was born on 3 July 1987 in Heppenheim, West Germany,[3] to Norbert and Heike Vettel. He has one younger brother, Fabian, a racing driver, and two older sisters: Melanie, a dental technician, and Stefanie, a physiotherapist for disabled children.[9] Vettel suggested in an interview that he was \"terrible\" at school, but he passed his *Abitur* at Heppenheim's Starkenburg-Gymnasium\u00a0[de] with a respectable grade.[10][11] His childhood heroes were \"The three Michaels\": Michael Schumacher, Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He mentioned that he wanted to be a singer like Jackson, but realised that he did not have the voice.[12] Vettel is also a fan of the Beatles, collecting several records, including *Abbey Road* and his favourite song being \"Drive My Car\". In an interview on *Top Gear*, he stated that he is a fan of British comedy such as *Little Britain* and *Monty Python's Life of Brian*. Vettel lives in Thurgovia, Switzerland, amongst other racing drivers and is a fan of German football team Eintracht Frankfurt.[13] Vettel has described himself as competitive, private and impatient. He also appeared in advertisements for Head & Shoulders,[14] and provided the voice of character Sebastian Schnell in the German dub of the 2011 film *Cars 2*,[15] and a voice command assistant in the German and Italian dubs of the 2017 film *Cars 3*.[16]\n\n\nVettel married childhood friend Hanna Prater at a private ceremony in early 2019,[17] and they have three children.[18][19][20] In 2016, *Forbes* estimated that his annual income was $41\u00a0million.[21] Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, his teammate from 2015 to 2018, is a close friend.[22] Besides his native German, Vettel speaks English, French, Finnish and Italian.[23][24] In July 2022, he created his Instagram account,[25] having long eschewed social media.[26] Vettel's first Instagram post was to announce his retirement from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[27]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2023, Vettel announced his involvement with the Germany SailGP Team, as co-owner of the team alongside Thomas Riedel.[28]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nVettel began karting at the age of three, and began racing in karts series in 1995 at the age of eight. He was accepted into the Red Bull Junior Team in 1998,[29] and won various titles, such as the Junior Monaco Kart Cup in 2001. Vettel was promoted to open-wheel cars in 2003, and was given a chance by Derrick Walker to test a Reynard Motorsport Champ Car in a two-day private test at the Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway.[30] A year later, he won the 2004 Formula BMW ADAC championship with 18 victories from 20 races.[31]\n\n\nVettel drove for ASL M\u00fccke Motorsport in the 2005 Formula 3 Euro Series. He was placed fifth in the final standings with 63 points and won the Rookie Cup. He tested for the Williams Formula One team later that year as a reward for his Formula BMW success. Vettel then went on to test for the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[32][33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving at a F3 Euroseries demonstration event in 2006\nVettel was promoted to test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, and participated in the 2006 Formula 3 Euro Series, finishing as runner-up.[34] He also competed in the 2006 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, where he finished first and second at Misano in his first two races. In the next round at Spa-Francorchamps, his finger was almost sliced off by flying debris following an accident, and he was expected to be out for several weeks.[35] Nevertheless, he managed to compete in the 2006 Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort the following weekend, where he finished in sixth place.[36]\n\n\nVettel competed in the 2007 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, and took his first win at the N\u00fcrburgring. He led the championship when he was called up permanently by the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[37]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel on his race debut at the 2007 United States Grand Prix\n### BMW Sauber (2006\u20132007)[edit]\n\n\n#### Test driver and debut[edit]\n\n\nVettel became BMW Sauber's third driver at the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix, when former incumbent Robert Kubica replaced Jacques Villeneuve as second driver for the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.[38] On his testing debut, Vettel set the fastest time in the second Friday free practice.[39] Vettel became the then-youngest Formula One driver to participate in a Grand Prix weekend at 19 years and 53 days.[40] He also set a record for collecting his first fine in nine seconds into his career, as Vettel exceeded the pitlane speed limit on the way to the track.[41] In his second testing session at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions.[42]\n\n\nVettel was confirmed as BMW's test driver for 2007. Following Kubica's crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel was named his replacement at the 2007 United States Grand Prix.[43] He started in seventh position and finished in eighth to become the then-youngest driver to score a point in Formula One.[44]\n\n\n\n### Toro Rosso (2007\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n#### Youngest polesitter and first race win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving for Toro Rosso at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix\nBMW released him in July 2007 to join Red Bull's Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Scott Speed from the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, as Vettel was already under contract to Red Bull Racing.[45] It was also announced that he would drive for Toro Rosso in 2008 alongside S\u00e9bastien Bourdais.[46]\n\n\nIn the rain-affected Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji, Vettel worked his way up to third, behind Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull Racing's Mark Webber, and seemed to be on course for his and the team's maiden podium finish. However, Vettel crashed into Webber under safety car conditions, forcing both cars to retire. Webber said after the race: \"It's kids isn't it. Kids with not enough experience \u2013 you do a good job and then they fuck it all up\".[47] Vettel was initially punished with a ten-place grid penalty for the following race, but this was lifted after a spectator video on YouTube showed the incident may have been caused by Hamilton's behaviour behind the safety car.[48]\n\n\nVettel finished a career-best fourth a week later at the Chinese Grand Prix, having started 17th on the grid while in mixed conditions.[49][50] He was tipped by Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz as one of the sport's big future stars: \"Vettel is one of the young guys with extraordinary potential [...] He is fast, he is intelligent, and he is very interested in the technical side.\"[51]\n\n\nAfter four races of the 2008 season, Vettel was the only driver to have failed to finish a single race, having retired on the first lap in three of them. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Vettel scored his first points of the season with a fifth-place finish, after qualifying 17th. Toro Rosso's technical director Giorgio Ascanelli explained that something changed at the European Grand Prix in Valencia: \"Suddenly Vettel understood something about how to drive an F1 car quickly. It made a huge difference\u00a0\u2013 not only to the speed he could unlock but also to his ability to do so consistently.\"[52]\n\n\nAt the wet Italian Grand Prix, Vettel became the youngest driver in history to win a Formula One Grand Prix, aged 21 years and 74 days.[53] He led for the majority of the Grand Prix and crossed the finish line 12.5 seconds ahead of McLaren's Heikki Kovalainen.[54] It would also be Toro Rosso's only win.[55] Earlier in the weekend, he had already become the youngest pole-sitter.[56] Toro Rosso team boss Gerhard Berger said: \"As he proved today, he can win races, but he's going to win World Championships. He's a cool guy\".[57] His victory led the German media to dub him \"Baby Schumi\".[58]\n\n\nVettel was named 2008 Rookie of the Year at the Autosport Awards.[59]\n\n\n\n### Red Bull (2009\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009\u20132010: Championship runner-up and youngest world champion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel after winning the 2009 Japanese Grand Prix\n![](image)Vettel driving for Red Bull Racing at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix, where he took the first pole position of the season\nAt the start of the 2009 season, Vettel replaced the retired David Coulthard at Red Bull Racing. He began strongly at the Australian Grand Prix, running in second for the majority of the race. However, a clash with Robert Kubica over second place in the latter stages forced both to retire.[60] He went on to take pole position and the race win at Chinese Grand Prix; Red Bull Racing's maiden pole and win.[61]\n\n\nFurther wins followed in Great Britain, Japan and Abu Dhabi.[62] He won the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position, leading every lap.[63] Vettel won the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the first ever day-night race, to finish second in the World Drivers' Championship standings behind Jenson Button.[64] He also scored his third fastest lap of the year, drawing him level with teammate Mark Webber. However, as Vettel had more second fastest laps, he won the 2009 DHL Fastest Lap Award.[65]\n\n\nVettel took the first pole position of the 2010 season at the Bahrain Grand Prix.[66] He led most of the race but as a result of a spark plug failure, Vettel finished in fourth place.[67] At the Australian Grand Prix, Vettel was appointed as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[68] He took his first win of the season in Malaysia.[69]\n\n\nIn Monaco, Vettel made it a Red Bull 1\u20132 with him second and Webber first. Both were equal on points in the standings, with Webber first based on total wins.[70] At the Turkish Grand Prix, Vettel was running second behind Webber when he made a passing move on his teammate. The two collided, putting Vettel out of the race, with neither driver accepting responsibility for the collision.[71]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, both Vettel and Webber's cars were fitted with a new front wing design. Vettel's wing was damaged in the third practice session, and Webber's sole surviving example was removed and given to his teammate.[72] Vettel qualified in first place, but suffered a puncture. He finished seventh while Webber took the victory. In Japan, he qualified on pole ahead of Webber and went on to win with a lights-to-flag victory. Aged 23 years and 98 days, Vettel became the youngest Grand Prix driver to win at the same track on two occasions.[30] At the inaugural Korean Grand Prix, Vettel led the first 45 laps before retiring with engine failure, handing victory to championship rival Fernando Alonso.[73]\n\n\nWith the 1\u20132 finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Vettel and Webber secured Red Bull Racing's first World Constructors' Championship.[74] Vettel went into the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi with a 15-point deficit to Alonso and a 7-point gap to Webber.[75] He won the Grand Prix from pole to become the youngest World Drivers' Champion in the sport's history, as Alonso only finished in seventh place.[76] Following John Surtees in the 1964 season and James Hunt in 1976, this was the third time in Formula One history that the title winner had not topped the championship table until after the last race.[77]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132012: Successful title defences, most poles in a season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel's win at the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix was his first win in the principality, and his fifth from the first six races of the 2011 season.\n![](image)Vettel at the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix where, with four races remaining in the season, he became the youngest double World Drivers' Champion\n![](image)Vettel at the 2012 United States Grand Prix\nVettel started the 2011 season with wins in Australia and Malaysia, before a second-place finish at the Chinese Grand Prix due to poor tyre management, possibly related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio was broken.[78] In Monaco, Vettel led the race but due to another radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not prepared when he came in. The pit stop was slow and he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button. Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps. He was caught by Alonso and Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him.[79] The race was red-flagged with few laps remaining, which allowed teams to change their tyres; when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able to retain the lead and win.[80]\n\n\nAt the European Grand Prix, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) enforced a ban on engine mappings. It was believed by some in the press that this was an attempt by the FIA to thwart Vettel's early domination.[81] Nevertheless, he took pole with the fastest qualifying lap in Valencia Street Circuit's history. Vettel dominated with his first hat-trick of 2011, and won his sixth race out of eight.[82] The FIA implemented another rule change at the British Grand Prix, targeting the blown diffusers. Red Bull believed the changes would cost them about half a second per lap.[83] During the race, Vettel held off Webber for second place, who ignored a radio message from team principal Christian Horner to hold position.[84] It was only the second time in the sport's history that a driver had finished second or higher in each of the first nine races of a season and won at least six of them.[85]\n\n\nVettel's run of fourteen successive front-row starts and eleven successive top two finishes ended at his home race, where he qualified third and finished fourth. In Italy, he took his tenth pole position of the year, in which he joined Ayrton Senna as the only driver to have taken ten pole positions in two separate seasons.[86] A podium finish in Japan secured his second successive title with four races remaining, making him the youngest ever double and back-to-back champion.[87] Vettel won the following race in Korea to become the second driver to take at least ten wins in a season after Michael Schumacher.[88]\u00a0He also helped to secure Red Bull's second successive World Constructors' Championship.[89] Vettel took his eleventh victory of the season in the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, leading every lap from pole position, as well as setting the race's fastest lap to claim his first grand slam.[90] Vettel broke the record for the most pole positions in a season at the season finale in Brazil, after he clinched his 15th pole of the year.[91] He completed the year with 15 poles, 11 victories, and 17 podiums from 19 races; Vettel also earned a record total of 392 points.[92]\n\n\nVettel started the 2012 season with a second place at the Australian Grand Prix, before he finished outside the points in Malaysia following a collision with backmarker Narain Karthikeyan. Vettel and Horner criticised Karthikeyan's driving, with Vettel calling him an \"idiot\",[93] and a \"cucumber\".[94] Karthikeyan hit back, calling Vettel a \"cry baby\".[95] Vettel crossed the line in first place at the Bahrain Grand Prix to go top of the championship standings.[96] Three races without a podium place followed, before he retired at the European Grand Prix after an alternator failure, dropping him to fourth in the standings.[97] In Germany, Vettel finished second behind Alonso but received a 20-second time penalty after the race, as he was off the track when he overtook Button; Vettel dropped back to fifth.[98] He started in 10th place but finished second in Belgium to climb up to second place in the championship.[99] Vettel then retired at the Italian Grand Prix due to an alternator failure, which saw the gap to leader Alonso grow to 39 points with seven races remaining.[100][101] He won next race in Singapore, as he kept the lead until the 2-hour race limit was reached.[102] At the Japanese Grand Prix he took his second career grand slam and coupled with Alonso's retirement, he cut the gap down to just four points.[103] After winning at the Korean Grand Prix, the Indian Grand Prix brought another victory, as Vettel topped all three practice sessions before taking pole position and leading every lap of the race to win.[104]\n\n\nDuring qualifying at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Vettel was told to stop the car due to a fuel pump issue; he was forced to start from the pit lane.[105] From last place, Vettel fought his way back to finish in third place.[106] He started the last race in Brazil with a 13-point cushion against Alonso.[107] On the opening lap, Vettel spun after an incident with Bruno Senna. Following changing weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to finish in sixth place to win the championship by three points and to become the youngest ever triple world champion.[108] He also became the third driver to acquire three consecutive championships, after Juan Manuel Fangio and Schumacher.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132014: Quadruple world champion, nine wins in a row, and departure from Red Bull[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel (left) controversially passing teammate Mark Webber at the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix, despite team orders to maintain position\nVettel started the first two races of the 2013 season on pole position, and at the Malaysian Grand Prix, he lapped over 2.5 seconds faster than teammate Webber in qualifying during a wet session.[110] He won the race, though not without controversy. Vettel ignored the team orders and passed Webber for the lead. Webber was furious after the race and said that Vettel \"will have protection as usual and that's the way it goes\".[111] Team principal Horner, although unhappy with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions. He acknowledged that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident.[112] Vettel claimed that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed Webber despite the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race.[113]\n\n\n\nFollowing wins in Bahrain and Canada, his championship lead was cut at the British Grand Prix as he was denied a likely win due to gearbox failure. Vettel bounced back to win his home race in Germany for the first time. After he finished third in Hungary, Vettel won the last nine races of the season, including grand slams in Singapore and Korea. Vettel set the then-record for most consecutive race wins with nine and he became only the third man after Alberto Ascari and Jim Clark to take consecutive grand slams.[114] He sealed his fourth world title at the Indian Grand Prix.[115]\n\n> \n> *\"It's very difficult for me personally, to receive boos, even though you haven't done anything wrong.\"*\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSebastian Vettel, on being booed on the podium.[116]\n\nOn several occasions during the season, spectators booed Vettel. The booing was widely condemned by fellow drivers, the media and others in the paddock,[117] and Vettel later revealed that it had a negative impact on him.[116]\n\n\nFor the 2014 season and beyond, drivers picked a unique car number to use for the remainder of their Formula One career; Vettel chose the number five. However, as reigning World Drivers' Champion, he carried number one throughout the season.[118] Webber left the sport and was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo, who was promoted from Toro Rosso.\n\n\nVettel struggled with reliability issues throughout winter testing, which forced him to retire at the opening Australian Grand Prix.[119] Reliability problems also forced Vettel to retire at the Monaco and Austrian Grands Prix. Vettel qualified on the front-row for the races in Malaysia, Great Britain and Hungary, and finished on the podium in Malaysia, Canada, Singapore and Japan. After the Russian Grand Prix, he had been outqualified by a teammate over a season for the first time in his Formula One career. In addition to suffering reliability problems, throughout 2014 Vettel struggled to get to grips with the Red Bull RB10,[120] and the Pirelli tyres.[121] He signed off the year by becoming the first defending champion to fail to win a race during a season since Jacques Villeneuve in 1998.[122]\n\n\nIn October, Red Bull had announced that Vettel would be leaving the team at the end of the season to join Scuderia Ferrari, one year before his contract was due to expire.[123] Vettel replaced Alonso and partnered his friend Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen.[124] Vettel mentioned he would like to drive for Ferrari at some point in his career and was already rumoured in 2012 to have a non-binding pre-contract, with options, to join them in 2014.[125] He was denied an early release from his Red Bull contract to test the 2014 Ferrari car in Abu Dhabi.[126] In spite of this, Vettel was present at the Ferrari test \u2013 although not driving the car \u2013 but Red Bull did not enforce any sanctions.[127] Vettel instead made his first appearance in November, completing nearly 100 laps in the 2012 car around the test track of Fiorano.[128]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (2015\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> *The next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true. When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.*\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSebastian Vettel, on his lifelong dream of driving for Ferrari\n\n#### 2015\u20132016: Returning to the top step, a threat to Mercedes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, where he took his maiden win for Ferrari\nVettel made his Ferrari debut by finishing third in the Australian Grand Prix.[129] He followed that up with winning the Malaysian Grand Prix,[130] his first race victory for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost two years. After the race, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with Ferrari made the first win all the more special.[131]\n\n\nHe won the Hungarian Grand Prix to remain a championship contender after he started from third on the grid. He dedicated his victory to the driver Jules Bianchi, who died the week prior from injuries sustained in 2014.[132] At the halfway point of the season, Vettel was 42 points behind championship leader and Mercedes driver Hamilton.[133] Vettel was in third place in Belgium when his right rear blew at high speed on the penultimate lap, likely ending any title chances given Hamilton's win. After the race, he ranted about the 'unacceptable' and 'unsafe' Pirelli tyres that could have caused him serious injury.[134]\n\n\nVettel came home second in the Italian Grand Prix, his first race with Ferrari at the team's home soil.[135] He then took his first pole with the team at the Singapore Grand Prix,[136] Ferrari's first pole for three years. Vettel went on to win the race, and with Hamilton retiring, he closed to within 49 points with seven races remaining.[137] Vettel ended the season in third place, however, with three wins and 13 podiums; he declared the season as a 'miracle'.[138]\n\n\nAfter a third-place finish at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix,[139] Vettel's participation in Bahrain ended without starting as his car broke down on the formation lap.[140] At the Chinese Grand Prix, Vettel collided with teammate R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen on the first lap, but both were able to continue. He blamed Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat for the collision, labelling him a \"madman\" and described his overtaking manoeuvre as \"suicidal\".[141] At the Russian Grand Prix, Vettel retired on the first lap after two consecutive collisions with Kvyat.[142] At the Mexican Grand Prix, Vettel attempted to overtake Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, but after Verstappen ran off the track and rejoined ahead of him, Vettel verbally attacked him and race director Charlie Whiting, for which he later apologised.[143] Vettel then blocked Red Bull's Ricciardo by moving in the braking zone, and was given a ten-second penalty and two points on his licence.[144] Although he achieved seven podium finishes during the season, Vettel did not win any races in 2016.[145]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u20132018: Championship challenges ending in disappointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel during pre-season testing for Ferrari in 2017\nHis third season at Ferrari started with victory in Australia, his first in 18 months.[146] The early form continued the following races, winning in Bahrain and Monaco,[147][148] and finishing second in China, Russia and Spain.[149] In Russia, Vettel took his first pole position in 18 months and with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen alongside him, Ferrari had their first front row lock out since the 2008 French Grand Prix.[150] Vettel's lead at the top of the standings increased to 25 points after the Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari's first victory at the circuit since Schumacher won there in 2001.[148]\n\n\nIn Azerbaijan, Vettel collided into the rear of race leader Hamilton under the safety car, accusing Hamilton of brake testing him.[151] Moments later, Vettel pulled alongside and hit his Mercedes as they prepared for a restart, for which he received a ten-second stop-go penalty.[152] The FIA investigated the Vettel-Hamilton incident further, but Vettel received no punishment. Vettel took full responsibility, issuing a public apology and committing to devote personal time over the next 12 months to educational activities across a variety of FIA championships and events.[153]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix\nVettel's championship lead was cut to only a single point in Great Britain, as he suffered a puncture on the penultimate lap and dropped to seventh place.[154] Vettel started from pole in Hungary and maintained the lead. He overcame steering issues and held on for victory, which gave him a 14-point lead over Hamilton.[155] Mercedes dominated after the summer break and Vettel lost the championship lead at the Italian Grand Prix,[156] which was followed by a first-lap retirement in Singapore after collision with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Verstappen. It was the first time in Formula One history that both Ferraris retired from the first lap of a Grand Prix.[157] His title hopes were dealt another blow in Malaysia, as he started last following a turbo problem in qualifying. He finished in fourth place, but crashed with Williams' Lance Stroll on the cool-down lap; neither would be penalised.[158] More reliability issues befell Ferrari in Japan as Vettel retired due to a spark plug failure.[159] In Mexico, Vettel became the fourth driver in Formula One history to claim 50 pole positions.[160] Verstappen took the lead from Vettel at the start, before Vettel collided with Hamilton, after which Hamilton won his fourth title.[161] For the first time in his career, Vettel failed to win the World Drivers' Championship having led it at some stage during a season.[162]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving past his fans at the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix\nThe 2018 season was dubbed the \"Fight For Five\" by the media, as for the first time in Formula One history, two quadruple world champions lined up at the start of a season.[163] For the second consecutive year, Vettel began the season with victory in Australia, after he took the lead while pitting under the virtual safety car.[164] It was his 100th podium, while he also became only the third man in Formula One history to have led 3,000 laps.[165] In Bahrain, Vettel maintained the lead from pole through the first round of pit stops and held off Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas despite being on old soft tyres to take a fourth victory at the circuit.[166] At the Chinese Grand Prix, he was hit by Verstappen in the latter stages of the race, which caused both to spin. Vettel limped home in eighth place, with his championship lead reduced to nine points.[167] For the first time since 2013, Vettel took three consecutive pole positions as he qualified in first place in Azerbaijan. It was the 23rd different Grand Prix at which he had taken pole position, equalling Hamilton's then-record.[168]\n\n\nAt the Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel won for the third time in 2018 and for the 50th time in his career, becoming only the fourth man to reach a half-century of wins.[169] The following race in France, Vettel lost the championship lead following a collision with Bottas.[170] He bounced back in Great Britain, after he passed Bottas in the last laps to take victory.[171] Vettel led his home race until he slid off the track and hit the wall in the latter stages as rain started to fall, as he had clipped the sausage curb a few laps before, breaking a part of his front wing, causing understeer and loss of downforce;[172][173] he won in Belgium, however, in which he passed Hamilton for the race victory.[174] Contact on the opening lap with Hamilton in Italy saw Vettel damage his front wing and drop to the back of the field, but he recovered to cross the finishing line in fourth place. It left Vettel 30 points behind the Mercedes driver with seven races left.[175] His championship hopes were dealt a further blow as Ferrari's upgrades introduced at the Singapore Grand Prix proved to be unsuccessful, making a step backwards on car development; Ferrari suffered a dip of form until the United States Grand Prix, where they reverted to their old package and successfully rediscovered their form.[176][177] Vettel claimed his first ever podium in Mexico but the World Drivers' Championship went to Hamilton for a second consecutive year.[178] Although Mercedes had been the more consistent and better team,[179] fans and pundits criticised Vettel for making too many mistakes during the season.[180]\n\n\n\n#### 2019\u20132020: Difficult ending at Ferrari[edit]\n\n\nAfter showing impressive pace throughout pre-season testing in Barcelona, Vettel and his new teammate Charles Leclerc headed to Australia with many pundits believing they had the car to beat for the 2019 season.[181] The opening weekend proved to be difficult, however, as Vettel qualified some seven tenths off pole position in third and finished the race in fourth place.[182] Third-place finishes in China and Azerbaijan followed, as Mercedes continued to dominate.[183] Vettel took pole position in Canada; his first pole in 17 races.[184] Midway through the race, a snap of oversteer caused him to run wide onto the grass. Vettel received a five-second time penalty from the stewards, who believed he had returned to the track \"in an unsafe manner and forced [Hamilton] off track\".[185] Vettel crossed the line in first place but lost his victory as a result of the penalty. After the race, he swapped the number one and two signs in front of Hamilton's Mercedes and the empty spot that was supposed for his own car, as Vettel parked his car at the start of the pit entry.[186] At the German Grand Prix, Vettel was unable to qualify after a turbo issue, which meant he would start in last place. During a race with mixed weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to second place.[187]\n\n![](image)Vettel driving the SF90 at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix In Italy, Vettel spun at the Ascari chicane and when he re-entered the track, he made contact with Racing Point's Stroll. Vettel received a 10-second stop-go penalty and finished in 13th place.[188] At the Singapore Grand Prix, Vettel won on a circuit Ferrari were expected to struggle at. For the first time, Vettel had won five times at the same track.[189] The following race, in Russia, Vettel went from third place on the grid to first place in the first corner. However, radio transmissions suggested that the team wanted to swap their drivers, but with Vettel the quicker driver, he remained in front. Vettel retired soon after with a MGU-K problem.[190]\n\n\nVettel took pole position in Japan,[191] but an abrupt start off the line caused him to momentarily stop before getting away, which allowed Bottas to take the lead; Vettel was not penalized for his jump start.[192] After running in third at the Brazilian Grand Prix for the majority of the race, a safety car allowed Red Bull's Alexander Albon and an aggressive Leclerc to overtake him. He tried to pass his teammate immediately but the two Ferraris collided, resulting in another retirement for Vettel.[193] He finished fifth in the World Drivers' Championship, and was outscored by a teammate for only the second time across a season.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel competing for Ferrari on their 1000th Grand Prix\nFerrari later announced they would not extend Vettel's contract beyond the 2020 season. Team principal Mattia Binotto explained there was \"no specific reason\" for the decision, though both parties noted it was an amicable agreement.[195] The season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the first ten races of the original calendar were either rescheduled, postponed or cancelled altogether. Ferrari discovered problems on their car following pre-season testing, forcing them to make a major redesign.[196]\n\n\nThe SF1000 lacked pace as Vettel finished the season's opening race in Austria in 10th place.[197] During the weekend, he was also given a warning for breaching the FIA's COVID-19 protocols after he was seen mixing with members of his former team Red Bull.[198] The following race, at the Styrian Grand Prix, Vettel retired on the opening lap with rear wing damage following a collision with Leclerc.[199] He ended the season in a disappointing 13th place in the Drivers' standings, with a third place in Turkey as his best result.[200] Ferrari only finished sixth in the Constructors' standings, their worst result since 1980, while Vettel's total of 33 points was the lowest in a full campaign in his Formula One career.[201][202]\n\n\n\n### Aston Martin (2021\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2021 British Grand Prix\nVettel joined Aston Martin for the 2021 season, replacing Sergio P\u00e9rez.[203] In his debut race weekend in Bahrain, he received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last. While Vettel started well, he had a collision with Esteban Ocon, giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place. He received five penalty points on his superlicence.[204] Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer reported no concerns, owing to this being a very different car from the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing and a very impressive race start.[205] In the fifth race of the season, Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth-place finish in Monaco.[206] At the following race, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, he claimed Aston Martin's first podium with a second-place finish.[207] Vettel also finished second in Hungary, but was later disqualified, after his car failed to provide the one litre sample of fuel required.[208] He ended the season in 12th place in the Drivers' standings, ahead of teammate Stroll.[209] During the season, Vettel made 132 overtakes\u2014the most of any driver\u2014and won the inaugural Overtake Award.[210]\n\n\nVettel missed the first two races of the 2022 season in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia after testing positive for COVID-19; he was substituted by Aston Martin's reserve driver Nico H\u00fclkenberg.[211][212] In July 2022, Vettel announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[213]\n\n\n\n## Race of Champions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel at the 2007 Race of Champions\nVettel competed in the 2007 Race of Champions at Wembley Stadium, representing the German team alongside Michael Schumacher,[214] winning the Nations' Cup title. He also teamed up with Schumacher from 2008 to 2012, winning the Cup on every occasion.[31]\n\n\nVettel returned to the 2015 Race of Champions, representing Germany together with Nico H\u00fclkenberg.[215] He won his very first individual Race of Champions title that year, beating Tom Kristensen in the final.[216] Vettel and H\u00fclkenberg finished runner-up in the Nations Cup.[31] In 2017, Vettel was eliminated in the first heat for the individual competition,[217] but went on to win the Nations' Cup for Germany by himself with his seventh victory,[218] after his teammate Pascal Wehrlein was injured earlier in a crash.[219]\n\n\nIn the 2019 event, Vettel teamed up with Mick Schumacher, where they finished runners-up in the Nations' Cup to the Nordic team of Kristensen and Johan Kristoffersson.[220] Vettel was eliminated in the group stages of the individual competition,[221] although he won the ROC Skills Challenge.[222] He reached the individual final in 2022 but was beaten by S\u00e9bastien Loeb.[223]\n\n\n\n## Helmet design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2017 helmet design\nFrom his karting days, Vettel worked with helmet designer Jens Munser. At the age of eight, Vettel wanted Sebastian the crab from *The Little Mermaid* on his helmet.[224] Vettel's original helmet in Formula One, like most Red Bull-backed drivers, was heavily influenced by the energy drink company logo. New to Vettel's helmet at the start of 2008 was the incorporation of the red cross shape of the Kreis Bergstra\u00dfe coat of arms on the front, just underneath the visor, in honour of the region of his birthplace, Heppenheim.\n\n\nAfter switching to Red Bull in 2009, Vettel regularly used a variety of new helmet designs. Some designs were small changes to his original Red Bull design, while others were completely new designs, such as the one he used at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix: Vettel had a special white-red helmet design, with black kanji and hiragana for \"gives you wings\". Several of his helmet designs also featured his team members.[225] At the 2012 Italian Grand Prix, Vettel celebrated his 50th helmet design with a 'rusty' matte look and 50 tallies, indicating his 50 helmet designs in Formula One.[226] Vettel started his 2013 campaign with a design in honour of Felix Baumgartner, for his world record Red Bull Stratos space jump in October 2012.[227] By the end of the 2013 season, he had used 76 different helmet designs throughout his career.[228]\n\n\nFor the 2017 Italian Grand Prix he changed the German flag stripe on his helmet to an Italian flag stripe in celebration of Ferrari's home race.[229] Following the death of Niki Lauda, Vettel wore a special helmet based on Lauda's final Ferrari helmet at the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix.[230]\n\n\n\n## Car names[edit]\n\n\nInspired by American bomber pilots in the Second World War, Vettel made it a tradition to name his cars. He said: \"It's important to have a close relationship with a car. Like a ship, a car should be named after a girl as it's sexy\".[231] The car he drove for his first full season in 2008, the Toro Rosso STR3, was named Julie, followed by Kate and Kate's Dirty Sister (2009), Luscious Liz and Randy Mandy (2010), Kinky Kylie (2011), Abbey (2012) and Hungry Heidi (2013). Vettel's car for 2014, the Red Bull RB10, was baptised Suzie. Vettel continued this tradition with Ferrari and christened his 2015 Ferrari SF15-T Eva, followed by Margherita (2016) Gina (2017), Loria (2018), Lina (2019), and Lucilla (2020).[232] In 2021, he named his Aston Martin AMR21 car after Honey Ryder, a character from the James Bond film, *Dr. No*.[233]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Car\n | Name(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **2008** | Toro Rosso STR3 | Julie\n |\n| **2009** | Red Bull RB5 | KateKate's Dirty Sister\n |\n| **2010** | Red Bull RB6 | Luscious LizRandy Mandy\n |\n| **2011** | Red Bull RB7 | Kinky Kylie\n |\n| **2012** | Red Bull RB8 | Abbey\n |\n| **2013** | Red Bull RB9 | Hungry Heidi\n |\n| **2014** | Red Bull RB10 | Suzie\n |\n| **2015** | Ferrari SF15-T | Eva\n |\n| **2016** | Ferrari SF16-H | Margherita\n |\n| **2017** | Ferrari SF70H | Gina\n |\n| **2018** | Ferrari SF71H | Loria\n |\n| **2019** | Ferrari SF90 | Lina\n |\n| **2020** | Ferrari SF1000 | Lucilla\n |\n| **2021** | Aston Martin AMR21 | Honey Ryder |\n\n\n## Comparison to Michael Schumacher[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel and Michael Schumacher after the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix, where Vettel won his second World Championship title\nVettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\".[234]\n\n\nNevertheless, the similarities were marked. Like Schumacher, Vettel grew up in a small town with an everyday background\u2014Schumacher's father is a bricklayer and Vettel's is a carpenter. Both had their first taste of racing at the Kerpen karting track near Cologne, not far from the N\u00fcrburgring. Vettel began driving in his garden lapping the garden many times before he could legally take to the roads, and said his passion for cars was nurtured by watching Schumacher compete.[235]\n\n\nAfter winning his first championship in 2010, and being hailed as the \"Next Schumacher\", Vettel stated he did not want to aim for Schumacher's record after learning how hard it was to get one championship under his belt, though he would like to win more.[236] In 2011, Pirelli director Paul Hembery was impressed when Vettel was the only driver to take the time to visit the factory and talk to the tyre manufacturer to gain a better insight. \"The only other driver that asks us a lot of questions is Michael Schumacher. It is like seeing the master and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at work.\"[237]\n\n\nAfter Schumacher was severely injured in a skiing accident in late 2013, Vettel was on hand to collect the Millennium-Bambi Award for Schumacher's life achievements on his behalf in 2014.[238] In 2014, Vettel cited Schumacher as one of his inspirations in becoming a Scuderia Ferrari driver: \"When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\nVettel has demonstrated an interest in the environment and other social justice issues. Following the 2021 British Grand Prix, he helped remove litter from the stands,[240] and he also worked with children in Austria to build a hotel for bees.[241] A second bee hotel would be erected at the Suzuka International Racing Course ahead of the 2023 Japanese Grand Prix.[242] Furthermore, Vettel has been critical of how F1 races are scheduled, stating that races that are geographically proximate to each other should be held on consecutive weekends to reduce emissions from travelling.[243] He also held an all-women karting event during the weekend of the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix,[244] and wore the pride flag at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix despite being reprimanded.[245] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Vettel expressed an intent to boycott the September's Russian Grand Prix had the race gone ahead as planned.[246]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Vettel appeared on the BBC One political topical debate programme *Question Time* to discuss a variety of issues including climate change, energy dependency, and Brexit.[247] The following month, Vettel appeared on the cover of *Attitude*, voicing support for an LGBTQ driver competing in Formula One.[248] In June 2022, while participating in the Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel denounced Canada's mining of the Alberta oil sands by wearing a T-shirt and helmet patch calling it \"Canada's climate crime\". Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called it \"over-the-top hypocrisy\" because Vettel's team, Aston Martin, is sponsored by petroleum company Saudi Aramco, which he said has \"one of the worst climate-emissions records in the world\".[249] Vettel agreed with the \"hypocritical\" label but said those personal attacks risk missing what he called the \"bigger picture\" of the climate crisis.[250]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nVettel was named Rookie of the Year at the 2008 Autosport Awards. In 2009, Vettel was awarded the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy, for his achievements in the 2008 season. He was also awarded the 2009 British Racing Drivers' Club Johnny Wakefield Trophy for \"setting the fastest race lap of the season on the Silverstone Grand Prix Circuit\".[251] In 2010, Vettel was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year and won the *Autosport* International Racing Driver Award, which he also won in the following three years.[252] In January 2012, Vettel was honoured with the Grands Prix de l'Academie des Sports, and in February, he was further honoured with the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in recognition of his world titles and his \"exemplary character\".[253] Vettel was voted Formula One driver of the year in 2009,[254] 2011[255] and 2013[256] by the team principals, initiated by the *Autosport* magazine. He additionally won the DHL Fastest Lap Award in 2009, 2012 and 2013. He was named European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association in 2010,[257] and by the Polish Press Agency in 2012[258] and 2013.[259] Furthermore, Vettel was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 2013. He was named Sportsman of the Year at the 2014 Laureus World Sports Awards.[260] In 2015, he received the Confartigianato Motori Award for Driver of the Year.[261] After retiring from Formula One in 2022, Vettel received the *Autosport* Gregor Grant Award for his \"achievement in motorsport\".[262]\n\n\nRed Bull Racing sponsor Infiniti released a Sebastian Vettel edition of the Infiniti FX SUV for 2012. It featured increased engine power, revised bodywork and lower suspension than the standard model.[263]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

A four-time Formula One World Drivers' Champion, from 1987 until 2001 he held the record for most Grand Prix victories until Michael Schumacher surpassed Prost's total of 51 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. \n\n\nProst discovered karting at the age of 14 during a family holiday. He progressed through motor sport's junior ranks, winning the French and European Formula Three championships, before joining the McLaren Formula One team in 1980 at the age of 24. He finished in the points on his Formula One debut \u2013 at the San Mart\u00edn Autodrome in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he took his first podium a year later \u2013 and took his first race victory a year later at his home Grand Prix in France, driving for the factory Renault team.\n\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s Prost formed a fierce sporting rivalry, mainly with Ayrton Senna but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. In 1986, at Adelaide in the last race of the season, he beat Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title, after Mansell retired late in the race and Piquet was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a series of controversial clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out. Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After a sabbatical in 1992, he joined the Williams team, prompting Mansell, the reigning Drivers' Champion, to leave for CART. With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship and retired from Formula One driving at the end of the year.[1]\n\n\nIn 1997, Prost took over the French Ligier team, running it as Prost Grand Prix until it went bankrupt in 2002. From 2003 to 2012 he competed in the Andros Trophy, an ice racing championship, taking 38 race victories and winning the championship three times. Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modelling himself on personal heroes like Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark.[2] He was nicknamed \"The Professor\" for his intellectual approach to competition. Though it was not a name he particularly cared for, he would admit later that it was an appropriate summation of his approach to his racing. Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAlain Prost was born in the commune of Lorette near the town of Saint-Chamond, in the d\u00e9partement of Loire close to Saint-\u00c9tienne, France to Andr\u00e9 Prost and Marie-Rose Karatchian, born in France of Armenian descent.[3][4] Prost had one younger brother called Daniel, who died of cancer in September 1986.[5][4] Prost was an active and athletic child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including wrestling, roller skating and football. In doing so he broke his nose several times.[3][4] He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered kart racing at the age of 14 while on a family holiday. This new sport quickly became his career of choice.[3][4]\n\n\nProst won several karting championships in his teens. In 1974, he left school to become a full-time racer, supporting himself by tuning engines and becoming a kart distributor. His prize for winning the 1975 French senior karting championship was a season in French[6] Formula Renault,[7][3] a category in which he won the title and all but one race in 1976.[8]\n\n\nProst went on to win the 1977 Formula Renault European championship before moving up to Formula Three (F3) in 1978. In 1979, he won both the French and European F3 championships, by which time he was on the shopping lists of several Formula One teams.[7] After carefully considering his options, he chose to sign with McLaren for 1980.[3] He surprised the British team by declining their offer of a race drive in a third car at the final race of the 1979 season at Watkins Glen \u2014 reasoning that the token effort would benefit neither him nor the team.[9] Prost felt that it would be a mistake to race in Formula One without being fully prepared: \"..in the end I said, \u2018No' to Marlboro. I asked them to understand that I didn't want to make a mistake; I didn't know Watkins Glen and I didn't know the car. I said I thought it would be a better idea to organise a test.\"[10]\n\n\n\n## Formula One[edit]\n\n\n### McLaren (1980)[edit]\n\n\nProst began his career with McLaren (being run by Teddy Mayer) in 1980 alongside Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he finished in sixth place, earning one point, something achieved by only a handful of drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the previous round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.[9][11][7]\n\n\n\n### Renault (1981\u201383)[edit]\n\n\nProst was partnered with fellow Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux for 1981. Motor sports author Nigel Roebuck reports that there were problems between Prost and Arnoux from the start of the season, Prost being immediately quicker than his more experienced teammate.[12] He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with Andrea de Cesaris in Long Beach and Didier Pironi at Jacarepagu\u00e1, but scored his first podium finish at Buenos Aires. He also did not finish in the next four races, and then won his first Formula One race at his home Grand Prix in France at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.[13][14]\n\n\nFor Prost, his debut victory was memorable mostly for the change it made in his mindset. \"Before, you thought you could do it,\" he said. \"Now you know you can.\"[3] Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first pole position in Germany and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, seven points behind champion Nelson Piquet.[15]\n\n\nProst won the first two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost recovered from losing a wheel,[16] and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified.[17] He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth,[18] but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race.[19] His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that \"When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. I think, to be honest, I had made the mistake of winning! The French don't really like winners.\"[12]\n\n\nIn November 1982, three years before it became a round of the F1 World Championship, Prost, along with fellow F1 drivers Jacques Laffite and Nelson Piquet, made the trip to Melbourne, Australia to drive in the non-championship 1982 Australian Grand Prix at the short (1.609\u00a0km (1.000\u00a0mi)) Calder Park Raceway. Driving a Formula Pacific spec Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford engine, Prost sat on pole for the race with a time of 39.18. He then led every lap to win what would be the first of 3 Australian Grand Prix wins. He finished 15.32 seconds clear of Laffite, with 1981 Australian Grand Prix winner, young Brazilian driver Roberto Moreno finishing third.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost's 1983 Renault RE40, in which he came close to winning his first championship\nArnoux left Renault in 1983 and American Eddie Cheever replaced him as Prost's partner, allegedly because of Renault's desire to sell more road cars in North America (three of the season's 15 races were on the North American continent). Prost earned a further four victories for Renault during the season and finished second in the Drivers' Championship, two points behind Nelson Piquet. Piquet and the Brabham team overhauled Prost and Renault in the last few races of the season. Prost, who felt the team had been too conservative in developing the car, found himself increasingly at odds with Renault's management, who made him the scapegoat for failing to win a championship. In addition to that, the French fans recalled the bitter fight that had caused their favourite, Arnoux, to leave the team. Prost said in an interview with ESPN during the final race that his car was \"not competitive\" and that he \"didn't lose by my own fault\"[21] Renault fired Prost only two days after the South African race. He re-signed for McLaren for the 1984 season within days and moved his family home to Switzerland after Renault factory workers burned the second of 2 of Prost's cars, one of them being a Mercedes-Benz.[12]\n\n\n\n### McLaren (1984\u20131989)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost in 1984\n#### 1984\u20131986[edit]\n\n\nProst joined double world champion Niki Lauda at McLaren (now being run by Ron Dennis) in 1984, driving the John Barnard designed McLaren MP4/2 which used a 1.5 litre TAG-Porsche V6 engine. He lost the world championship to Lauda in the final race of the season in Portugal by half a point, despite winning seven races to Lauda's five,[18] including winning in Portugal.[22] The half point came from the Monaco Grand Prix, where Prost had been leading, albeit with Ayrton Senna (Toleman) and Stefan Bellof (Tyrrell) closing on him rapidly, when Clerk of the Course Jacky Ickx stopped the race at half distance due to heavy rain, which was controversial, for Ickx displayed the red flag without consulting the race officials. Under Formula One regulations, Prost received only half of the nine points normally awarded for a victory.[23] Prost's seven wins in 1984 equalled the record set by Jim Clark in 1963.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost driving the McLaren MP4/2B at the 1985 German Grand Prix\n![](image)Cockpit of Prost's F1 McLaren TAG-Porsche turbo, from his first Championship year\nIn 1985 Prost became the first French Formula One World Champion. He won five of the sixteen Grands Prix during the season. He had also won the San Marino Grand Prix, but was disqualified after his car was found to be 2\u00a0kg underweight in post-race scrutineering.[18][25] Prost finished 20 points ahead of his closest rival, Michele Alboreto.[26] Prost's performance in 1985 earned him the L\u00e9gion d'honneur distinction in France.[8][27]\n\n\nNiki Lauda retired for good at the end of 1985, and was replaced at McLaren by 1982 World Champion Keke Rosberg for 1986. Prost successfully defended his title, despite his car struggling against the Honda-powered Williams cars driven by Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. Until the latter stages of the final race of the 1986 season, the Australian Grand Prix, Prost appeared set to finish second in the Championship, behind Mansell. Prost had the same number of wins as Piquet, but he had four second places to Piquet's three, thus placing him second before the final race. While running third behind Piquet, and directly behind Prost on the road (3rd was all he needed to win the title), Mansell suffered a rear tyre failure at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and crashed out. The Williams team then pitted Piquet to change tyres as a safety precaution, while Prost had already pitted earlier due to a puncture and did not need to change his tyres again. He then held the lead ahead of a charging Piquet to the chequered flag and the Championship.[18] Prost became the first driver to retain the title since Jack Brabham in 1960.[28]\n\n\nAnother memorable race that year for Prost was at the San Marino Grand Prix. He was cruising to victory when his car began to run out of fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race.[29] Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself *\"shit, I am going to lose this race again\"*, referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola.[25] It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd.[30] The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.[31] Prost also finished sixth at the Belgian Grand Prix, where he collided with Gerhard Berger in the Benetton. As a result, the car's front suspension and engine mountings were bent, which badly affected its handling. It would behave one way in left hand corners and a completely different way in right hand corners. McLaren Technical Director John Barnard said afterwards that the car was \"bent like a banana\" upon the teams' post-race inspection of the car.[32]\n\n\n\n#### 1987[edit]\n\n\nWith Rosberg retiring from Formula One at the end of 1986 season, underrated Swede Stefan Johansson filled the McLaren seat alongside Prost for the 1987 season. Even though McLaren had introduced the new Steve Nichols designed MP4/3 after three seasons with the MP4/2 model (Barnard had departed for Ferrari), the TAG engines were not the force they had been previously, lagging behind in power and with unreliability previously unseen. He never gave up though and challenged Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and breaking Jackie Stewart's record for race victories by winning for the 28th time at the Portuguese Grand Prix. \"People might not believe me,\" said Stewart at the time. \"But I'm glad to see Alain take my record. I am glad that he has done it because he's the one that deserves it. There is no doubt in my mind that he is the best race driver of his generation.\"[33][18] Prost considers his win in the opening round in Brazil as his best and most rewarding race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been dominant during qualifying, and Prost started fifth on the grid with a time three seconds slower than Mansell's pole time. Knowing he didn't have the qualifying speed, he instead worked on his race set-up, and with everyone else going for a high-downforce set-up, he went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. With his car having less tyre wear than his rivals, Prost was able to get through the 61 laps of the abrasive Jacarepagu\u00e1 Circuit with only two stops compared to the three or more by his rivals (Piquet pitted for tyres 3 times within the first 40 laps). Prost finished 40 seconds in front of Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.\n\n\n\n\n> When you win a race like this the feeling is very, very good. There have been times when I have been flat-out to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In 1980 I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact the only thing you can judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.[34]\n> \n> \n\n\nProst finished the 1987 season in fourth place in the championship behind Piquet, Mansell and Lotus driver Ayrton Senna. Prost finished 30 points behind champion Nelson Piquet.[35] Other than his debut season in 1980 and 1991, it was the furthest away he would finish a season from the championship lead.[3]\n\n\nDespite a slightly disappointing 1987 season, nevertheless by the end of that year Prost had the honour of notching up his 4th consecutive No.1 driver of the year by the editor of the *Autocourse* annual, matching Niki Lauda's run of No.1's from 1975 to 1978 in the same annual. Writing in 1987, the *Autocourse* editor mentioned that despite driving a down on power engine (compared to the Honda's) \"Prost should have won at least 6 races in 1987 \u2013 but he won't moan about it. Despite being out of championship contention, 1987 was a memorable year for Prost. His win at Estoril was exceptional.\"[36] In 1985, the *Autocourse* editor wrote of Prost: \"In the long run, Ayrton Senna may be the better driver, but in 1985 for speed and consistency Prost had no equal\",[37] while in 1986, the *Autocourse* editor commented on Prost's season \"Alain had an almost faultless year. 1986 was a year of Prost's outstanding all round ability.\"[38]\n\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost driving for McLaren at the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix\nDespite Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Drivers' Championship and Williams winning the Constructors' Championship, Honda decided not to supply the team with their engines, reportedly due to Williams's refusal to dump Nigel Mansell and hire Japanese driver and Honda test driver Satoru Nakajima (who debuted with Lotus in 1987), and instead supplied the McLaren team for 1988.[39] Prost had convinced Ron Dennis to sign Ayrton Senna to a three-year contract,[40] which played a role in luring Honda (Senna's ability had been highly regarded by the Japanese giant when using their engines with Lotus in 1987 and both were keen to continue their association).[41] However, this began the rivalry that pushed two of the sport's greatest drivers to unprecedented heights of success and controversy. McLaren-Honda dominated the season, winning 15 out of 16 races. Prost finished first or second in every race other than his two retirements at Silverstone and Monza. He won seven races and in total outscored his new teammate Senna by 11 points, despite Senna winning one more race than him. However, only the 11 best results from the season counted toward the championship total, and this gave Senna the title by three points.[18] Prost went on to be a proponent of essentially the 1990s scoring system: all points counting toward the final results, with a race winner scoring 10 (rather than 9).[42]\n\n\nIn November of that year, Prost had a meeting with the head of Honda's R&D department and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and \"samurai\"-like driving. Senna had already developed a close relationship with the Honda engineers during the 1987 season when he was at Lotus. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.[43][40]\n\n\n\n#### 1989[edit]\n\n\nMcLaren's domination continued throughout 1989, and the struggle between Prost and Senna for supremacy put them on a collision course. Mutual admiration turned to all-out hatred, with Prost accusing Senna of \"dangerous driving\"[3] and of receiving more than a fair share of attention from both McLaren and Honda. For his part, Senna accused Prost of being in the pocket of FISA's French president Jean-Marie Balestre.[44] The animosity between the two drivers came to a head at Round 2 in San Marino. The drivers made an agreement between them that whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other going into the first turn (in this case, the Tosa bend on the Imola circuit). Prost kept to the agreement after Senna won the first start. Prost however won the restart (caused by Gerhard Berger's fiery crash in his Ferrari), but was passed by Senna under brakes for Tosa. Prost went to a friend of his, a French journalist, and told him about the broken agreement between him and Senna. Against Prost's wishes, the journalist went public with the story. During testing at Pembrey in Wales, Senna denied in public any such agreement had ever existed between Prost and himself, but Prost's claim was backed up by Marlboro's John Hogan who had been present when the agreement was made.[45]\n\n\nProst had the firm belief that Honda and Ron Dennis viewed Senna as the future of the team. Prost recalled that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one car with maybe four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him.[40] Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining Ferrari. Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments. However, Prost received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his 1990 teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not seem to work as well as was once normal. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if there was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. To the delight of the tifosi whose team he signed for the 1990 season, at the rostrum Prost dropped his driver's trophy into the crowd, to the anger of Dennis who since changed McLaren's policy requiring that all trophies won by drivers belong to the team. Dennis was in fact so incensed at Prost that he threw his constructor's trophy at Prost's feet on the rostrum. Prost had a replica trophy made for Dennis but it sat in a cupboard for over 6 years.[46][47]\n\n\nAs 1989 wore on, Prost continually claimed his Honda V10s were not producing the same amount of power as those in Senna's car. It actually got to the point where Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality).[48] Evidence to support Prost's claims was seen during the Mexican Grand Prix. His car was running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came off the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than Senna and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.[49]\n\n\nTheir embittered season ended as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix at the end of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casio Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path resulting in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of Senna's car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban.[50] Thus, Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances, later stating \"Ayrton Senna came behind me, I didn't see him come and I couldn't do anything to avoid him. I am very sorry to have to finish the championship on such an incident\".[51]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1990\u20131991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost practising for his first event for Ferrari, the 1990 United States Grand Prix\nProst signed to join Ferrari in 1990, becoming the first driver signed to the team after the death of team founder Enzo Ferrari in 1988. He replaced Gerhard Berger at Ferrari and was partnered with Britain's Nigel Mansell for 1990 (Berger took Prost's seat at McLaren). As reigning world champion, Prost took over as the team's lead driver and was said to have played on this status. Mansell recalls one incident where at the 1990 British Grand Prix, the car he drove didn't handle the same as in the previous race where he had taken pole position, and later found out from team mechanics that Prost saw Mansell as having a superior car and had them swapped without Mansell knowing.[52][53] Prost won five races for Ferrari that year, in Brazil, Mexico, France, Britain and Spain. Notable among these was the Mexican Grand Prix, where he won after starting in 13th position.[54] In both the Mexican and Spanish races, he led Mansell to Ferrari 1\u20132 finishes. The championship once again came to the penultimate round of the season in Japan with Prost trailing his McLaren adversary, Ayrton Senna, by nine points. As in 1989, a controversial collision between the two settled the race.[18] At the first corner Senna, as admitted a year later, intentionally drove his race car into Prost's, taking them both out of the race and sealing the title in his favour.[44] \"What he did was disgusting,\" Prost said. \"He is a man without value.\"[3] Prost finished the season seven points behind Senna, and his Ferrari team were runners-up to McLaren.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost at the 1991 United States Grand Prix\nMansell left the Scuderia due to his unstable relationship with Prost,[56][53] to rejoin Williams for the 1991 Formula One season. Mansell's replacement was Frenchman Jean Alesi, who had been impressive during the previous two years at Tyrrell. Ferrari had entered a downturn, partially as their famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel efficient V10s of their competitors. The Ferrari chassis, despite a major revision by the French Grand Prix (F-643) was also not up to the level of the McLaren and the Williams models. Prost won no races, only getting onto the podium five times. He took this out on the team, publicly criticising the team and the Ferrari 643,[57] and subsequently had his contract terminated before the end of the season, immediately prior to the Australian Grand Prix.[58] He was replaced by Italian driver Gianni Morbidelli for the final race of the 1991 season and by another Italian, Ivan Capelli, for the following season. Despite being sacked, Prost received a significant payment from Ferrari to not drive for any other team.[59]\n\n\n\n### Williams (1993)[edit]\n\n\nProst went on a sabbatical year in 1992,[3] which was dominated by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team.[59] After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. Prost had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year.[60] Prost was part of a new-look driver line-up at Williams,[61] with test driver Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.[62]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of an F1 car being driven perpendicular to camera](image)\n![Blue Formula One car turning slightly.](image)\nProst driving his 1993 Williams-Renault FW15C at Silverstone (left) and Adelaide (right).\n\nProst won his fourth and final title in a year when he was regularly challenged by teammate Hill and by Ayrton Senna. Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, because the clause in his contract did not extend to 1994 and Senna would be able to join Williams for the upcoming season,[60] and instead opted to retire.[1] At the season's end Prost held the record for most Grand Prix victories,[63][3] a record that stood for almost a decade.[64] On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost was surprised by the gesture, as Senna had declined a handshake at the previous race.[40] Prost's performances earned him an OBE.[65][66]\n\n\nGerman Michael Schumacher broke Prost's record of 51 Grand Prix wins during the 2001 season.[64] He also shares the record for starting every race of a season from the front row (16, in 1993), with Ayrton Senna (1989) and Damon Hill (1996).[67] As of January 2023[update], he is the last Frenchman to have won his home Grand Prix.[68]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost's helmet for the 1988 Formula One season\nProst used a helmet design based on the three colours of the French flag, blue, white and red, with his name along the side. During his early career Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor (blue helmet with a white 180\u00b0 flipped Y and red lines in the lower branch of the flipped Y and in the upper branch, surrounding the top).[69] During Prost's time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet. Prost's helmet changed in 1985, as his helmet now had the blue detail around the front, surrounding the visor (with also a blue stripe on the side region, making the white area become a P) and a white ring with red lines surrounding the top (forming a white circle with a blue half in the rear of the top).[70] Prost kept a similar design for his entry at Ferrari and Williams.\nSometimes Prost used variants of his helmet design. In 2007 he used his original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white helmet with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe on the visor, designed by Kaos Design.[71]\n\n\n\n## Career legacy[edit]\n\n\nProst is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever Formula One drivers, and is considered by some to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[72] In 2009, an *Autosport* survey taken by 217 Formula One drivers saw Prost voted as the fourth greatest Formula One driver of all time.[73] In October 2020, *The Economist* ranked champion drivers by the relative importance of car quality to driver skill. According to this ranking, Prost is Formula One's third best driver of all time.[74] In November 2020, Carteret Analytics used quantitative analysis methods to rank Formula One drivers. According to this ranking, Prost is Formula One's eighth best driver of all time.[75] A 2022 mathematical analysis of all F1 drivers by f1-analysis.com put Prost as the 4th greatest driver of all time, and the second greatest once differences between different eras had been corrected for.[76] In November 2022, *Autosport* ranked Prost as the statistical fourth best driver of all time.[77]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry with Ayrton Senna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prost\u2013Senna rivalry\n\nProst's battles with Ayrton Senna were particularly notable. The rivalry originated in 1988, when Senna joined Prost at the McLaren team. The most notable event during the season between the two occurred during the Portuguese Grand Prix, where Senna tried to block Prost from taking the lead by forcing him to run close to the pit wall at around 280\u00a0km/h (174\u00a0mph). Prost managed to edge Senna outwards, taking the lead as they went into the first corner, but remained angered by Senna's manoeuvre.[78]\n\n\nThe rivalry intensified after the 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, where the two drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner (*cf.* 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in his way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, Prost got away the better of the two but Senna forced his way past him at the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement at the start of the race, leaving Prost furious.[45] Senna argued that it was the restart.[79] Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda,[40] so he announced in mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season. Prost mentioned many times during 1989 that he believed his car was not as competitive as Senna's, and even that this was confirmed to him by the CEO of Honda when Prost traveled to Japan. The information was actually confirmed during the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis said that Prost's car was consistently using more fuel, but not getting more power, than Senna's engine.[80]\n\n\nThe rivalry reached its peak at the end of 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at Suzuka. The two McLarens collided at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away while Senna returned to the track. Senna went on to win the race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, Senna received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading him to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favouring his compatriot Prost.[81]\n\n\nThe following season saw the two drivers collide again. With Senna leading Prost, now in a Ferrari, in the world Drivers' Championship, Prost qualified second for the penultimate race of the season in Suzuka with Senna on pole. Senna was apparently told by a Steward that the pole position would be on one side of the track but discovered before the race that it would be actually be on the other side. Senna complained that no longer being on the racing line, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip (and therefore a slower start) than Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. Senna's appeal was rejected.[82] At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two, but while braking for the first corner Senna did not brake and collided with Prost at 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), clinching the title for himself.[83] Prost almost retired from the sport, saying \"What he did was disgusting. He is a man without value.\"[3] A year later, Senna admitted that the move was premeditated, in retaliation for the collision at the chicane on the same course the previous year.[44]\n\n\nThere was another controversial incident in 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari was unable to put up a challenge regularly to Senna's front running McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very same point.[84] At the following race, in Hungary, the FISA ordered a sit-down meeting between the two men, not wanting any repeats of the incidents from the previous two years.[85]\n\n\nProst took a sabbatical in 1992 after being fired from Ferrari for publicly criticizing the car and the team,[86] and Senna struggled, because McLaren was no longer competitive with Williams. Prost announced his signing with Williams for the upcoming 1993 season. Senna too had wanted to join Williams, as they were the most competitive, but Prost had a clause in his contract excluding Senna as a teammate. An infuriated Senna called the Frenchman a \"coward\" during a press conference at Estoril, and decried his unwillingness to compete for the Drivers' Championship on equal sporting terms:\n\n\n\n\n> I think if Prost wants to be called the sole champion, three-times world champion, come back in a sportive way, maybe win another championship, he should be sportive. The way he's doing, he's behaving like a coward. And if he wants to be sportive, he must be prepared to race anybody, at any condition, at equal terms.[87]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the 1993 season, Prost and Senna continued their on-track rivalry. Prost was escorted by police to the Interlagos circuit for the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix due to the hostility of Brazilians towards him.[88] The two continued their on-track battles at Silverstone where Senna aggressively defended his position against Prost.[89] At Prost's last Grand Prix, the 1993 Australian Grand Prix, he was pulled up by Senna onto the top step of the podium for an embrace.[90][40]\n\n\nOn 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna was killed during the San Marino Grand Prix. Prost was a pallbearer at his funeral.[91] Speaking four years after Senna's death, Prost told Nigel Roebuck that he had \"always refused to speak about him\". Prost stated that when Senna died \"a part of himself had died also\", because their careers had been so bound together.[40] Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he admitted to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only a couple of days before his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: \"A special hello to my...to our dear friend, Alain. We all miss you Alain.\" Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment.[92][40]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nDuring 1994 and 1995, Prost worked as a specialist commentator (pundit) for the French TV channel TF1.[93] He also worked for Renault doing public relations and promotions.[94] Prost went back to his old team McLaren, working as a technical adviser;[3] he also completed L'\u00c9tape du Tour, an annual mass-participation bike ride that takes place on a stage of the Tour de France.[95]\n\n\n\n### Prost Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prost Grand Prix\n\nDuring 1989 Prost began to contemplate starting his own team, as his relationship with his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993.[96] By 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people had assumed that a Prost-Renault team would be formed. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olivier Panis driving for the Prost Grand Prix team at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix\nOn 13 February 1997, Prost bought the Ligier team from Flavio Briatore and renamed it \"Prost Grand Prix\".[97] The day after he bought the team, Prost signed a three-year deal with French car manufacturer Peugeot, who would supply the team with engines from 1998 until 2000.[97] For the team's first season, Prost kept one of Ligier's 1996 drivers, Olivier Panis, who had won the Monaco Grand Prix the previous year; Japanese driver Shinji Nakano was signed to partner Panis. The team raced with the Mugen-Honda engines used by Ligier the previous season, while the car was actually the originally intended Ligier JS45, but was renamed the Prost JS45. Things looked promising at the start of the season, as the team picked up two points on its Grand Prix debut in Australia when Olivier Panis finished fifth. The team scored a further 13 points before Panis broke his leg in an accident during the Canadian Grand Prix. He was replaced by Minardi's Jarno Trulli. From there, things started to go downhill slightly, the team scored only five points during Panis's recovery. He came back at the end of the season to race in the last three Grands Prix. Prost GP finished sixth in the Constructors' Championship in its first season, with 21 points.[98][99]\n\n\nProst became the president of Prost Grand Prix at the start of 1998. With Peugeot supplying the engines for Prost GP, Mugen-Honda decided to supply the Jordan team. Prost GP scored a single point during the season when Jarno Trulli finished sixth in Belgium.[99]\n\n\n1999 was a crucial year for Prost GP.[100] Prost hired John Barnard as a technical consultant,[97] Barnard's B3 Technologies company helping Loic Bigois with the design of the Prost AP02. Panis and Trulli agreed to stay on with the team for the season. The car was not a major concern but the Peugeot V10 engine proved to be heavy and unreliable.[99]\n\n\nPeugeot's final year as Prost's engine supplier in 2000 saw some optimism. Prost hired his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi to drive the lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one: the AP03 proved to be unreliable and ill handling. Things weren't helped when the drivers collided with each other in the Austrian Grand Prix. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.[97]\n\n\nIn 2001 Ferrari agreed to supply engines for the season.[97] The money ran out at the start of the 2002 season and Prost was out of business, leaving debts of around $30 million.[97]\n\n\n\n### Other roles[edit]\n\n\nDuring 2002, Prost spent time with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, finishing third in the *Granite \u2013 Mont Loz\u00e8re*.[101][102] The Frenchman raced in the Andros ice race series in 2003, finishing second in the championship behind Yvan Muller.[103][104] In 2003 and 2004, Prost took part in the \u00c9tape du Tour.[105] Prost also became an Ambassador for Uniroyal, a position he would keep until May 2006.[106][107] Prost continued to compete in the Andros Trophy, winning the title with Toyota in 2006/07, 2007/08[108] and with Dacia in 2011/2012.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\nFor the 2010 Formula One season, the Sporting Regulations were changed so that a former driver sits on the stewards' panel. Prost was the first such driver to take on this role, at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix.[113] Prost also took part in the Race of Champions in 2010, a race organised for legends of motor sport to compete in equal machinery.[114] In February 2012, Prost was named as Renault's new international ambassador, representing the company in sports demonstrations and at events organized or attended by Renault.[115] Prost has finished the Absa Cape Epic, an eight-day 700\u00a0km mountain bike race in South Africa, twice. He first completed the race in 2012 with partner Sebastien di Pasqua and then again in 2013, and started but did not finish the race in 2014.[116]\n\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Prost would join forces with Jean-Paul Driot's DAMS racing team to form e.dams, a team which would compete in the FIA Formula E Championship for electric racing cars from its commencement in September 2014.[117] In June 2014, the team announced that its initial driver line-up would consist of Nicolas Prost and S\u00e9bastien Buemi.[118] The team went on to win the inaugural Formula E teams championship.[119] In 2017, he was employed as a special adviser for the Renault Formula One Team.[120] Since July 2019, he took up a non-executive director role with Renault Sport. During the 1000th Formula One race, the 2019 Chinese Grand Prix, Prost had the honor of waving the chequered flag as Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the line to take his 75th career victory.[121] Prost continued in his role within Renault Formula One Team, renamed \"Alpine F1 Team\" in 2021, until January 2022, when his departure from the team was announced.[122]\n\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\nProst was married to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they divorced sometime later. They have two sons, Nicolas (born 18 August 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990).[123] Prost also has a daughter, Victoria, born in 1996 from his relationship with Bernadette Cottin.[124] From 2014 to 2018, Nicolas raced in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father.[125][126] Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his Renault team fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to Sainte-Croix, Switzerland, and shortly after to Yens, Switzerland. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost's house in France and burned his Mercedes-Benz and another one of his road cars.[8] They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to Nyon in the same country.[127][128] Through Nicolas, Prost has two grandsons named Kimi (born November 2015)[129][130] and Mika (born December 2020).[131] Through Sacha, he has another grandson named Liam\u00a0(born June 2018).[132]\n\n\nIn 1986, Prost was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by the French President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand;[8][27] he was promoted from Chevalier to Officier rank in 1993.[133][134] In addition, he was awarded an honorary British OBE in 1994,[66][65] and the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross in 1999.[135][136] He was also inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and the FIA Hall of Fame in 1999 and 2017 respectively.[137][138]\n\n\nProst speaks fluent French, English and Italian.[139]\n\n\n\n## Karting

Senna is one of three Formula One drivers from Brazil to win the World Championship and won 41 Grands Prix and 65 pole positions, with the latter being the record until 2006. He died in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, driving for the Williams team.\n\n\nSenna began his motorsport career in karting, moved up to open-wheel racing in 1981 and won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship. He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year, and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, the Williams-Renault combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the 1993 season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in 1994.\n\n\nSenna was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap, and from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, is the sixth-most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins and has won more races for McLaren than any other driver. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Alain Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna at the age of 3\nSenna was born at 2:35\u00a0a.m. (05:35 GMT) on Monday, 21 March 1960, in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, a neighbourhood of S\u00e3o Paulo.[2] The middle child of a wealthy Brazilian family, he was born to landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva; he had an older sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo.[3] He was left-handed.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Senna's mother was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, while his father was born to a Spanish mother (from T\u00edjola, Province of Almer\u00eda) and a Brazilian father from S\u00e3o Paulo.[5]\n\n\nThe house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged to Neide's father, Jo\u00e3o Senna. It was located on the corner of Avenida Aviador Guilherme with Avenida Gil Santos Dumont, less than 100 meters from Campo de Marte, a large area where they operated the Aeronautics Material park and an airport. Senna was highly athletic, excelling in gymnastics and other sports, and developed an interest in cars and motor racing at the age of four. However, as a small boy, he had poor motor coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was unremarkable (i.e. showed no abnormalities). Senna's parents nicknamed him \"Beco\".[6][*page\u00a0needed*] At the age of seven, Senna first learned to drive a Jeep around his family's farm and also how to change gears without using a clutch.[7]\n\n\nSenna attended Colegio Rio Branco in the S\u00e3o Paulo neighbourhood of Higien\u00f3polis and graduated in 1977 with a grade 5 in physics along with other grades in mathematics, chemistry, and English. He later enrolled in a college that specialised in business administration, but dropped out after three months.[8] Overall, his grades amounted up to 68%.[6][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna began racing go-karts in Brazil at the age of 13.\nSenna's first kart was built by his father using a small 1-HP lawnmower engine. Senna started racing at Interlagos and entered a karting competition at the age of 13.[9][*timestamp\u00a0needed*] He started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were some years older than him; despite this, he managed to lead most of the race before retiring after colliding with a rival. His father supported his son and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.[10][*timestamp\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nSenna went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. He contested the Karting World Championship each year from 1978 to 1982, finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980.[11] In 1978, he was the teammate of Terry Fullerton, from whom Senna later felt was the rival he got the most satisfaction racing against also because of the lack of money and politics at that level.[12]\n\n\nIn 1981, Senna moved to Eaton[13] near Norwich in England to begin single-seater racing, winning the RAC and Townsend Thoresen Formula Ford 1600 Championships that year with the Van Diemen team.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)21-year-old Senna in his British Formula Ford 1600 single seater\nDespite this, Senna initially did not believe he would continue in motorsport. At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil.[6][*page\u00a0needed*][14] Before leaving England, however, Senna was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for \u00a310,000. Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England. As da Silva is the most common Brazilian surname, he adopted his mother's maiden name, Senna.[15] Senna went on to win the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships.[16] For that season, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.[6][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Senna drove in the British Formula Three Championship for the West Surrey Racing team. He dominated the first half of the season until Martin Brundle, driving a similar car for Eddie Jordan Racing, closed the gap in the second part of the championship. Senna won the title at the final round after a closely fought and, at times, acrimonious battle with the Briton.[17] In November that year, Senna also triumphed at the inaugural Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix with Teddy Yip's Toyota-powered Theodore Racing Team.[18][19][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nSenna was managed for most of his career by Armando Teixeira, who was assisted by Domingo Piedade.[20]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Ayrton Senna\n\n### Toleman (1984)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna's Toleman TG184 from 1984 on display in the Donington Grand Prix Collection\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman. Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg.[21] Neither Williams or McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season.[21] Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) so that he would have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.\n\n\nPeter Warr actually wanted to replace Nigel Mansell with Senna at Lotus, but their British-based title sponsor, Imperial Tobacco (John Player & Sons), wanted a British driver. Senna, however, was determined to drive that season and certainly on his own terms. Senna's test for Brabham occurred at Circuit Paul Ricard in November 1983. Senna impressed the Brabham team and was linked to their second seat. However, the team's main sponsor, Italian dairy company Parmalat, wanted an Italian driver. Brabham's second car was eventually shared by brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi, while Piquet convinced Ecclestone to sign his friend Roberto Moreno as the test driver.[22][23]\nConsequently, Senna joined Toleman, a relatively new team, using less competitive Pirelli tyres.[24][25] Venezuelan Johnny Cecotto, a former Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion, was his teammate.[26]\nIn 1984, Senna hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition due to his concern over his low weight.[9]\n\n\nSenna made his debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro, where he qualified 17th, but retired when the Hart 415T turbocharger failed on lap 8.[27] He scored his first World Championship point when he finished 6th in his second race at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami with severe cramp in his neck and shoulders, and replicated that result two weeks later at the Belgian Grand Prix.[27][28]\n\n\nA combination of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in his failure to qualify for the San Marino Grand Prix, the only time this happened during his career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at Imola due to a dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli (Toleman were in the process of switching from Pirelli to Michelin). Senna then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid.[29] Senna's best result of the season came at the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, he made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing Niki Lauda for second on lap 19. He quickly began to cut the gap to race leader Alain Prost, but before he could attack Prost, the race was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the race was stopped, Senna was catching Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the Tyrrell-Ford of Stefan Bellof was catching both at the same rate, although he was later disqualified due to weight restrictions broken by Tyrrell).[30]\n\n\n\nSenna was renowned throughout his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long before the advent of telemetry; this skill led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the Dallas Grand Prix in the United States as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of Monaco. Symonds recalled in an interview:[31]\n\n\n> The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race, but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish, but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said \"I'm sure that the wall moved!\" And even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him after the race to have a look at the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit, the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened \u2013 we could see it from the tyre marks \u2013 was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.\n> \n> \n\nThat season, Senna took two more podium finishes\u2014third at the British and Portuguese Grands Prix\u2014and placed 9th in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points overall. He did not take part in the Italian Grand Prix after he was suspended by Toleman for being in breach of his contract by entering talks with Lotus for 1985 without informing the Toleman team first. Although Senna did have a \u00a3100,000 buyout clause in his contract, the team had to be informed before discussions with another team started.[32][33] Senna became the first driver Lotus had signed not personally chosen by team founder Colin Chapman, who had died in 1982.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the end of the year, Senna had developed Bell's palsy, possibly from a virus. One side of his face had become completely paralysed; Sid Watkins gave Senna steroids to preserve the possibility of recovery.[34]\n\n\n\n### Lotus (1985\u20131987)[edit]\n\n\n1985\n![](image)Senna driving the Team Lotus 97T at the 1985 European Grand Prix\nSenna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis. He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend. Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes out of inexperience. At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career. He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from Michele Alboreto[35] in the Ferrari and lapping everyone up to and including 3rd placed Patrick Tambay. The race was the first 'Grand Slam' of Senna's career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race. He would later argue it was the best drive of his career,[36] an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised Senna's \"truly special\" talent.[37]\n\n\nSenna led at the San Marino, Monaco, British and German Grands Prix but retired from all these races either from engine failure or running out of fuel, and he had a huge accident at the French Grand Prix at the Circuit Paul Ricard's fastest corner after an engine failure in the middle of the corner. He did not finish in the points again until coming second at the Austrian Grand Prix, despite taking pole three more times in the intervening period. (His determination to take pole at the Monaco Grand Prix had infuriated Alboreto and Niki Lauda; Senna had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately baulking the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge he rejected, though the accusations continued in Canada when drivers accused him of running on the racing line when on his slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time).[38] Two more podiums followed in the Netherlands and Italy, before Senna added his second victory in wet-dry conditions, at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium.[39] Senna's relationship with De Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus and, after spending six years at the team, De Angelis departed for Brabham at the end of the year, convinced that Lotus were becoming focused around the Brazilian driver.[40] Senna and De Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points. In terms of qualifying, however, Senna had begun to establish himself as the quickest in the field: his tally of seven poles that season was far more than that of any of the other drivers (Renault's V6 qualifying engines were reported to be producing over 1,000\u00a0bhp (746\u00a0kW; 1,014\u00a0PS)).[41]\n\n\n\n1986\n![](image)Senna driving the Lotus 98T at the 1986 British Grand Prix\nDe Angelis was replaced at Lotus by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver, which led to the signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted \"It was bad, bad. Until then I had a good relationship with Derek.\"[42] Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races.[43] Although the 98T was like the 97T which came before it, a quick car with superiority on tight, bumpy circuits but plagued with poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season it saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points. The 1986 F1 cars were the most powerful cars in history, with Senna's 98T producing over 1,300\u00a0bhp (969\u00a0kW; 1,318\u00a0PS) in qualifying and 850\u00a0bhp (634\u00a0kW; 862\u00a0PS) in the race.[44]\n\n\nAfter winning the Detroit Grand Prix from Frenchmen Prost and Jacques Laffite\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009which took place one day after Brazil was eliminated from the 1986 FIFA World Cup by France\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009Senna asked a trackside supporter for the Brazilian flag and he drove one lap waving it. Thereafter, he repeated this ritual every time he won a race. During an interview on American television, he used English curse words to express his frustration at having to go into the pits earlier than expected due to a deflating rear tire.[12] Senna also had a brief foray into rallying when he was invited by British magazine *Cars & Car Conversions* to try out a Vauxhall Nova, an MG Metro 6R4, a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and a Ford Escort on a stretch of land closed to the public.[45][46]\n\n\n\n1987\n![](image)The Lotus 99T raced by Senna in 1987\nTeam Lotus had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda. The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment.[47] Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an irate Mansell grabbed Senna by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics.[48][49] Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of his record six victories at the Principality) and the Detroit Grand Prix, his second victory in two years at the angular Michigan street circuit[50] and the first ever for an active suspension F1 car.[51]\n\n\nAs the championship progressed, however, it became evident that the Williams cars had the advantage over the rest of the field, the gap between the Honda-engined teams made most obvious at the British Grand Prix, where Mansell and Piquet in the superior Williams cars lapped the Lotuses of Senna and Nakajima who finished 3rd and 4th respectively. Senna became dissatisfied with his chances at Lotus and at Monza it was announced that he would be joining McLaren for 1988.[52] Senna was fined $15,000 for punching a corner marshal after they refused to push his stalled car in Mexico then finished the season strongly, coming second in the final two races in Japan and Australia, however post-race scrutineering at the final race found the brake ducts of his Lotus to be wider than permitted by the rules and he was disqualified, bringing his last and most successful season with Lotus to a sour end.[53] Senna was classified third in the final standings, with 57 points, six podium finishes and only one pole position. This season marked a turning point in Senna's career as, throughout the year, he built a deep relationship with Honda, which paid big dividends, as McLaren had secured Williams's supply of Honda's V6 turbo engines for 1988.[54]\n\n\n\n### McLaren (1988\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won his first world title in 1988 driving that season's dominant McLaren MP4/4.\nIn 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team.[55] The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years.[56] However, the experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton and Lotus.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Honda RA168E engine, which powered Senna to his first world championship\nOne notable incident of the year was at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Senna out-qualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67.[57] Instead of returning to the pit lane, Senna was so distressed by his mistake that he went back to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. After team manager Jo Ramirez called him through his Monaco apartment's cleaner hours after he had crashed, Senna was still devastated by his own mistake. As the television cameras had not captured his crash, team boss Ron Dennis did not know what had caused his DNF until then, though Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though Senna had clipped the inside barrier at Portier, which pitched him into the outside guard rail. At the Portuguese Grand Prix, Prost made a slightly faster start than Senna, but the Brazilian, as he would a number of times, dived into the fast first corner ahead. Prost responded and went to pass Senna at the end of the first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at 290\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph). Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away. Prost, normally a calm individual, was angered by Senna's manoeuvre, and the Brazilian got away with a warning from the FIA. At the post-race team debrief, Prost voiced his anger at the move which prompted Senna to apologize to Prost for the incident. Ultimately, the pair won 15 of 16 races in the dominant McLaren MP4/4 in 1988 with Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to Prost's seven. Prost scored more points over the season, but three of his second places were dropped, as only the 11 best scores counted, meaning that Senna bested Prost by three points.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alain Prost and victor Ayrton Senna at Grand Prix Molson du Canada at Montreal, Canada, in 1988\nHowever, the biggest incident of the year happened at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, who were closing in on the McLaren (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo chicane, Senna closed on the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for the unwell Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap, and the two collided; Senna's car was beached on top of a curb and had stalled. Ferrari went on to finish 1\u20132, the first in an Italian Grand Prix since the death of the team's founder Enzo Ferrari. This proved to be the only race McLaren did not win in 1988.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring the season, Senna rewrote the record books. His eight wins beat the old record of seven jointly held by Jim Clark (1963) and Prost (1984). His 13 pole positions also beat the record of nine held by Nelson Piquet (1984).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### 1989[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna driving the McLaren MP4/5 in 1989\nThe following year, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it.[59][*page\u00a0needed*] Some controversy also arose after the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis declared that they found consistent differences between the Honda engines from Prost and Senna, to the detriment of Prost.[60] Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the San Marino Grand Prix, a move which Prost claimed violated a pre-race agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, though Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of the team's major sponsor, Marlboro). A discussion between the two drivers and Dennis during a test session at the Pembrey circuit in Wales served to effectively confirm Senna and Prost's personal animosity to Dennis and the team. Senna took an early lead in the championship with victories in San Marino, Monaco, and Mexico. Senna also led every lap of those races, a feat unequalled until Sebastian Vettel replicated it in 2012.[61] Senna also managed to win in Germany, Belgium, and Spain. However, unreliability in four consecutive races in Phoenix, Canada, France and Britain, and further unreliability in Italy, together with collisions in Brazil and Portugal, swung the title in Prost's favour.[62]\n\n\nProst took the 1989 world title after a collision with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the gurney flap from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna.[63] This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners\u2014a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the tight last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini and went on to claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which was not part of the track.[64][65] A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in public criticism of the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made.[66] Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place. Prost, who could not stand working with Senna in what he felt was a hostile environment, left McLaren for rivals Ferrari the following year. Prost had burned bridges even with Ron Dennis after a trophy-related incident in Italy.[67]\n\n\n\n#### 1990[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The McLaren MP4/5B raced by Senna in 1990\nIn 1990, Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second-places, and three thirds. With Prost gone to Ferrari, he also had a new teammate in Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger. Among his victories were the opening round on the wide streets of Phoenix, in which he diced for the lead for several laps with Jean Alesi's Tyrrell before coming out on top, and in Germany, where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. Senna won six races, including another Monaco win, and as the season reached its final quarter, however, Prost in his Ferrari rose to the challenge with five wins, including a crucial victory in Spain where he and teammate Nigel Mansell finished 1\u20132 for the Scuderia. Senna had gone out with a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost was now reduced to nine points with two races left.[68]\n\n\nAs part of Japanese publisher Shueisha's sponsorship of McLaren, Senna collaborated with Akira Toriyama, the creator of *Dragon Ball*, on artwork for *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* featuring McLaren-themed illustrations of *Dragon Ball* characters. Senna was also featured in *GP Boy*, a two-volume manga published in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* to commemorate Shueisha's sponsorship.[69][70]\n\n\nAt the penultimate round of the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack, but after qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton,[71] the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would not have been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) and went off the track, went through the gravel trap and slammed into the tire barrier, making Senna world champion.[72][73]\n\n\nFollowing the second championship-deciding collision in two years, Jackie Stewart interviewed Senna at the subsequent race in Australia (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble forced him to slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved over the last few years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers in the last four years than all the champions before him. An irritated Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions like he did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced and famously said: \"Being a racing driver means you are racing with other people, and if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver.\"[74]\n\n\nA year later, after taking his third world championship, Senna admitted that he had deliberately crashed into Prost at the previous year's Japanese Grand Prix, and he then explained to the press his actions and motives at Suzuka that year. He maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, he had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the track (where the racing line was), only to find this decision reversed after he had taken pole.[75] Senna said that he was not going to accept what he saw as unfair decision-making by the FIA, including his 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990.[76] Senna stated that no matter what happened, he would not yield the corner and that Prost taking his normal racing line would result in an accident. Prost later went on record criticising Senna's actions as \"disgusting\", saying that he seriously considered retiring from the sport after that incident. During an interview with Eurosport at the Australian Grand Prix Prost revealed that he had seen the Honda engine telemetry at Suzuka and that it showed that Senna had kept his foot absolutely flat through the 4th gear corner when he had hit Prost\u200a\u2014\u200aSenna had not even taken his foot off the accelerator to change down to 4th for this corner, strongly intimating that Senna had taken Prost out on purpose.[55]\n\n\n\n#### 1991[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the season-opening United States GP with the new Honda V12-powered MP4/6.\nIn 1991, Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10.[77] Senna won the first four races in Phoenix, Brazil, Imola and Monaco as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge later in the season, having only scored six points by the time Senna had 40 points. Before the Mexican Grand Prix, Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near S\u00e3o Paulo for which he required stitches on the back of his head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier.[78] At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled over on his parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. Senna then had an enormous accident during testing at the very fast Hockenheim circuit in Germany where his car flew 15 feet into the air after a tyre failure, and turned over several times upon coming down onto the track. The car was destroyed and Senna had to spend the night in hospital in nearby Mannheim. While still able to compete in the German Grand Prix at the Hockenheim circuit soon thereafter, at that event Senna ran out of fuel mere laps before the end. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThough Senna's consistency, the car's competitiveness, and the Williams' unreliability at the beginning of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the MP4/6 before it was too late. These modifications, including modifications introduced at Hungary and variable inlet trumpets introduced at Belgium enabled him to make a late-season push, and he won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in Japan when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season.[79] Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty; in addition to Alain Prost's recommendation, Honda had played an important part in bringing Senna with them to McLaren.[80][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nThat year, as had been the case in 1988 and 1990, Senna won the \"International Racing Driver Award\" granted by British magazine *Autosport* annually. The award was presented by Stirling Moss and Senna was interviewed on stage by Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker. During the interview, Senna confirmed that at the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) gala dinner in Paris the day before, under the auspices of Jackie Stewart, Senna had given one of his helmets to his renowned foe, Jean-Marie Balestre, because of the sincere atmosphere that presented itself and as an insulting psychological gesture.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 1992[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix in his McLaren MP4/7A.\nIn 1992, Senna's determination to win manifested itself in dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car.[82] The FW14B, thanks in part to its aerodynamic-enhancing active suspension and powerful Renault V10 engine was much faster than any other car that season. McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new MP4/7A model running (it was McLaren's first car with a semi-automatic gearbox and it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit.[83] During practice for the second race of the season in Mexico on a badly maintained and extremely bumpy circuit Senna and other drivers were heavily critical of, his car hit a bump at one of the circuit's Esses corners that caused a loss of downforce and a hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. Senna had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors while wearing a neck brace; although he raced the next day, he had to retire from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year. During qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, French driver \u00c9rik Comas crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. Senna could hear the stricken car's engine revving at max RPM, and he exited his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman and shut off the car's screaming engine (which could have blown and started a fire at any moment), disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later visited Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from within Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher.[84][85]\n\n\nSenna's relationship with German rising star Michael Schumacher, who was showing exceptional form at every race was never a good one, possibly because Senna saw Schumacher as a threat to his supremacy in F1. At the 1992 Brazilian Grand Prix, Schumacher accused Senna of \"playing around\" while attempting to overtake Senna, who had a problem with his engine--a fact that Schumacher was apparently unaware of at the time. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher collided with Senna, resulting in Senna's retirement. Senna later confronted Schumacher, who admitted responsibility for the accident. At a test session for the German Grand Prix, Senna and Schumacher had a confrontation in the pits, with Senna grabbing Schumacher by the collar and accusing him of endangering him by blocking him on the track.[86]\n\n\nQuestions about Senna's intentions for the upcoming 1993 season lingered throughout 1992, as he did not have a contract with any team by the end of that year. Ferrari had offered him a contract which Senna discussed with Niki Lauda, but decided to decline the offer.[87] He felt the McLaren cars were becoming less competitive than in previous years, especially given Honda's decision to abandon the sport at the end of 1992 due to economic issues and McLaren's lack of active suspension relating to rival Williams.[88]\n\n\nGiven this scenario, Senna secured an IndyCar testing session with the support of compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi. In December 1992, in fact, Senna visited Firebird International Raceway in Chandler, Arizona near Phoenix in the United States[89] to test a 1992 Penske PC-21 CART Indianapolis car.[90] Unlike the more advanced F1 cars, this IndyCar was powered by a turbo Chevrolet-Ilmor V8, had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to its bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula One car; IndyCar teams were run with significantly smaller budgets than F1 teams and did not have to make their own cars. To familiarise himself, Senna initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which he later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 Penske PC-22 at his disposal during this test session.[91] In a 2018 interview, Fittipaldi revealed that Penske boss Roger Penske was ready to enter a third car for Senna to drive at the 1993 Indianapolis 500 - one of the most prestigious and important races in the world and a race that defending champion Mansell was competing at (who had left F1 for CART) - but when McLaren boss Ron Dennis found out it was a very serious deal he promptly banned Senna from competing at Indianapolis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 1993[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the 1993 European Grand Prix in changing conditions, in what many considered one of the best drives of his career.\nFor 1993, attempts were made by McLaren boss Ron Dennis to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines that Williams had found great success with. When these failed, Senna went to Williams himself and sought to take one of their two open rides, as defending champion Nigel Mansell joined the IndyCar Series for 1993 and longtime second driver Riccardo Patrese left to drive at Benetton alongside Michael Schumacher. However, despite Senna going so far as to be willing to forfeit his annual salary just to drive one of Williams' Renaults, this too would fail. Alain Prost was returning to F1 for the first time since the penultimate race of the 1991 season (he had been fired by Ferrari prior to the end of 1991, received a massive severance package as part of a non-compete clause, and took leave for the 1992 season) and filled one of the vacant Williams seats. His contract included a caveat that he had veto power over who he would team with in the other car for 1993; since he still had ill will toward his former McLaren teammate, Prost used that veto to freeze out Senna and force him into what was now a lame-duck season at McLaren.[93] Faced with this, during the post-race press conference of the 1992 Portuguese Grand Prix at the Estoril Circuit, an infuriated Senna called Prost a coward,[94] leading to some commentators stating that what Prost had done was no different from Senna vetoing Derek Warwick from joining Lotus in 1986, but they did not take into account that Senna's chances of winning the championship were much higher in 1993.[95][96]\n\n\nBy this time, McLaren was forced to take a customer supply of Ford V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, Benetton.[97] McLaren hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system \u2013 though the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate Michael Andretti.[98] With this plan, Dennis finally persuaded Senna to stay with McLaren. The Brazilian, however, agreed to do so only for the first race in South Africa, where he would assess whether McLaren's equipment was competitive enough for him to put in a good season. After driving McLaren's 1993 car, the McLaren MP4/8, Senna concluded it had surprising potential, albeit with a Ford V8 engine down on power relative to Prost's Renault V10 and less so on the Benetton's factory V8.[99] Senna thus extended his deal with McLaren on a race-by-race basis instead of a full-year contract, ending up staying for the whole of 1993 in any event.[100] Reportedly, this engagement was on a $1 million per race basis,[101] and, despite midseason testing with a Lamborghini V12 proving encouraging, with McLaren then signing an engine supply deal with Peugeot for the 1994 season, it all proved insufficient to continue to retain Senna past 1993.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna came from the back of the field to finish fourth at the 1993 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in his McLaren MP4/8.\nIn the opening race in South Africa, Senna finished in second place after surviving a collision with Schumacher.[102] Senna won in changing conditions in Brazil and Donington. The latter has often been regarded as one of Senna's greatest victories,[103] in the process setting a record for the fastest lap in an F1 race driving through the then speed-unrestricted pit lane. In cold, wet, rainy conditions typical of England in April he was fifth at the first corner and led the race at the end of the first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for rain or slick tyres.[104][105] Senna then scored a second-place finish in Spain and a record-breaking sixth win at Monaco, breaking Graham Hill's record of five.[106] After Monaco, the sixth race of the season, Senna unexpectedly led the championship from Prost in the Williams-Renault.[107] As the season progressed, Alain Prost and Damon Hill asserted the superiority of their Williams-Renault cars, while Senna suffered mechanical failures in Imola, Canada, Britain, Hungary, and Portugal, where Prost took his 4th world championship, losing apparently none of the skill he was not able to use during his 1992 sabbatical. Senna won the penultimate race of the season in Japan, which was marked by an incident involving Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine, twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the race, Senna angrily stormed into the Jordan team's garage and said to the Irishman \"You're driving like a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot! You're not a racing driver, you're a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot!\u201d before punching him in the side of the head.[108] Following that incident, the stewards gave Senna a two race suspended ban for 1994. However, after a discussion between Senna and the president of the FIA, a compromise was reached by removing the ban, considering the exemplary attitude of Senna towards his fellow drivers.[109] The decision created some polemic back at the time, both amongst drivers and in the press, considering that during the entirety of the 1993 season, Prost was under threat of a four-race ban for using words to criticize the president of the FIA, thus seemingly implying that punching a fellow driver in the face was viewed as a lesser transgression than criticizing the FIA.[110]\n\n\nThe season concluded in Australia, with Senna's 41st and last F1 career win, as well as the last win for an active-suspension F1 car (ironically, Senna had the first victory for a car with this technology in Monaco 1987). The win in Adelaide was an emotional one due to Senna ending his successful career with McLaren and defeating his biggest rival, Prost, for the last time. Because of the Frenchman's imminent retirement from the sport, Senna surprised the F1 community by openly welcoming Prost on the top step of the podium, which many considered a sign of pacification between the duo. Overall, Senna finished the championship second to Prost.[98][111]\n\n\n\n### Williams (1994)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Williams FW16 was the last F1 car raced by Senna.\nFor 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired[112] and was reportedly paid a $20\u00a0million salary.[113] Senna was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost, who would have been assigned number 1 had he returned, retiring. With Senna's arrival, a new sponsor came as well. Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for Williams, with Senna being one of their first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRule changes for 1994 had banned active suspension, traction control, and ABS. During preseason testing, the new Williams FW16 car exhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C and FW14B cars that preceded it, and Senna found himself in close running with the Benetton B194 of Michael Schumacher. Senna expressed his discomfort with the handling of his car, stating, \"I have a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on\u00a0... Some of that is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the car has its own characteristics which I'm not fully confident in yet.\"[114] Senna further added, \"It's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen.\"[115]\n\n\nThe first race of the season was at Interlagos in Brazil, where Senna took pole position. He took an early lead, but Schumacher's Benetton was never far behind. Schumacher took the race lead after passing Senna in the pits. While trying for a win, he pushed too hard and spun the car coming out of Jun\u00e7\u00e3o corner on lap 56, stalling it and retiring from the race.[112] The second race was the inaugural Pacific Grand Prix at Aida, where Senna again placed the car on the pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by second-qualifier Schumacher, he was hit from behind in the first corner by Mika H\u00e4kkinen and his race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini T-boned the Williams. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage. Hill also retired with transmission problems, while Schumacher took the victory again.[116]\n\n\nIt was Senna's worst start to a Formula One season, failing to finish or score points in the first two races, despite taking pole position both times. Schumacher was leading Senna in the Drivers' Championship by 20 points.[117] On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo revealed that, on 27 April 1994, he had held discussions at his home in Bologna with Senna about a future Ferrari engagement.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Season controversies and end[edit]\n\n\nThe 1994 season was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic \"driver aids\" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control. From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled Senna. For example, instead of returning to the pit area after his first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the race to see if he could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used.[119] He returned to the Williams pits after the race, suspicious that the Benetton car was illegal.[120] Indeed, in an interview for the 20th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death, his then-teammate, Damon Hill, revealed that Senna had \"concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine\" with \"special tweak\" giving Benetton an advantage.[121]\n\n\nThe season ended at the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, where the first-corner chicane at the Adelaide Street Circuit was renamed the \"Senna Chicane\". Schumacher went on to win the driver's world championship title controversially after a collision that forced his retirement and that of his rival, and Senna's teammate, Damon Hill. At the official FIA conference after the race, the German dedicated his title to Senna.[122]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Death of Ayrton Senna and 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\n\nThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April and 1 May 1994. The European leg of the F1 season, starting at Imola, was traditionally considered the beginning of the yearly competition. Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title.[123] Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling. During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello was involved in a serious accident when his car became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event. Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness.[124]\n\n\nDuring Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford broke entering the 310\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) Villeneuve corner, sending the car into the concrete retaining wall at high speed. Senna immediately visited the accident scene and medical centre. There he was met by FIA Medical Chief Professor Sid Watkins, who suggested to a tearful Senna that he should retire from racing and take up fishing (a hobby they both shared), to which Senna replied that he could not stop racing.[125] Senna was later called in front of the stewards for commandeering an official car and climbing the medical centre fence, and a row ensued, although Senna was not punished.[126] Senna spent his final morning on Sunday talking to former teammate and rival Alain Prost to discuss the re-establishment of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, a driver's union, with the aim of improving safety in Formula One. Prost had retired from the sport at the end of the 1993 season and was now a media presenter. As the most senior driver in competition, Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting from the next race in Monaco. During the drivers' briefing, concerns had been raised about the mainly promotional use of a Porsche 911 lead car for the warm-up lap, with organizers agreeing to abandon the practice.[126]\n\n\nAt the start of the Grand Prix, Senna retained the lead from his chief rival Michael Schumacher, but proceedings were soon interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. However, the Vectra's lack of speed proved detrimental to the racers, as the slower pace allowed the tyres of the Formula One cars to cool, thus decreasing their pressure. Senna pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, Max Angelelli,[127] to increase his speed.[128] On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace, completing the third-fastest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around 307\u00a0km/h (191\u00a0mph), ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around 233\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of the accident. Within two minutes of crashing, Senna was extracted from his race car by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. The initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss from his temporal artery being ruptured. At this point, Senna had already lost around 4.5 litres of blood, constituting 90% of his blood volume. Because of Senna's grave neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt 18:40 (16:40 GMT), the head of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandri[129] made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17 (12:17 GMT), which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped functioning.[126] Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.[12] The right-front wheel and suspension are believed to have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna on the right side of his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. A piece of upright attached to the wheel had partially penetrated his helmet and made a large indentation in his forehead. In addition, it appeared that a jagged piece of the upright assembly had penetrated the helmet visor just above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery, a major blood vessel supplying the face and scalp. According to Fiandri, any one of these three injuries would likely have killed him.[130][131]\n\n\nIt was later revealed that when the medical staff examined Senna's vehicle, a furled Austrian flag was discovered\u2014he had intended to raise it in honour of Ratzenberger after the race.[132] Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel were taken by Senna's friend and *Autosprint*'s picture editor, Angelo Orsi. Out of respect, those photographs have never been made officially public.[126]\n\n\n\n### Funeral[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAyrton Senna's resting place at the Morumbi cemetery in S\u00e3o Paulo, with an inscription in Portuguese that reads *\"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\"*\n\nSenna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the coffin back to Brazil, but the Senna family wished that it return home in a Brazilian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. The plane was escorted by fighter jets into S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport on 4 May 1994, where it was met by the Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Paulo Maluf, and the state's governor, Luiz Ant\u00f4nio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile (32.2\u00a0km) journey into the city. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.[133]\n\n\nOver half a million people flocked to the streets of Senna's home city of S\u00e3o Paulo to offer him their salute, the largest funeral procession Sao Paulo had ever seen.[134] Over 200,000 people filed past as his body lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in Ibirapuera Park. After the public viewing, a 21-gun salute was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven Brazilian Air Force jets flew in a diamond formation as the funeral procession made its way to Morumbi Cemetery. Many prominent motor-racing figures attended Senna's state funeral, which took place on 5 May, such as team managers Ken Tyrrell, Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart. The pallbearers included drivers: Gerhard Berger, Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost, Thierry Boutsen, Damon Hill, Rubens Barrichello, Roberto Moreno, Derek Warwick, Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin, Hans Stuck, Johnny Herbert, Pedro Lamy, Maurizio Sala, Raul Boesel, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, and Christian Fittipaldi. Neither Sid Watkins nor Jo Ram\u00edrez, the McLaren team coordinator, could bear to attend because they were so grief-stricken. Senna's family did not allow FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's, to attend the ceremony, after an altercation between Ecclestone and Senna's brother Leonardo at Imola regarding Ecclestone's misconstrued reaction to the news of Ayrton's death and the fact that the race had not been abandoned after his accident.[135] FIA President Max Mosley instead attended the funeral of Ratzenberger on 7 May, in Salzburg, Austria.[136] Mosley said in a press conference 10 years later, \"I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his.\"[137] Senna's grave bears the epitaph \"Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus\", which means \"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\" (a reference to Romans 8:38\u201339).[138]\n\n\nA testament to the adulation he inspired among fans worldwide was the scene at the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where McLaren-Honda cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received, they overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby.[139] This was despite the fact Senna no longer drove for a Honda-powered team. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda[140][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] and was beloved in Japan, where he achieved a near-mythic status.[141] For the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger.[142]\n\n\n\n### Italian prosecution[edit]\n\n\nItalian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended forthwith. Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter. The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.[143] This prosecution culminated with verdict no. 15050 handed down by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on 13 April 2007, which stated: \"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control\". Head, however, was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.[144]\n\n\nThe criminal charges focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed, causing the accident, and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was no time to manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.[145]\n\n\n\n## Motorsport career outside Formula One[edit]\n\n\nSenna did not participate in many other forms of motorsport once he reached Formula One.\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the saloon exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new N\u00fcrburgring in 1984.He took part in the 1984 N\u00fcrburgring Race of Champions, an exhibition race where all drivers competed in identical examples of the then-new Mercedes 190E 2.3\u201316 with minor race modifications. The race was held on the then newly-opened N\u00fcrburgring GP Track, before the European Grand Prix. Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula 1 drivers, including Stirling Moss and past World Champions Jack Brabham, Denny Hulme and Alan Jones, driving identical touring cars. Alain Prost started from pole position, but Senna took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning the race ahead of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann.[146] After the race, Senna was quoted as saying, \"Now I know I can do it.\"[147] Senna was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race, taking over from Emerson Fittipaldi.\n\n\nIn 1984 he also took part in the N\u00fcrburgring round of the 1984 World Sportscar Championship, driving a Porsche 956 for New-Man Joest Racing, alongside Henri Pescarolo and Stefan Johansson.[20] He finished in 8th place but impressed the team and his co-drivers.\n\n\nHe took part in the Masters Karting Paris Bercy event in 1993, an indoor karting competition held on a temporary circuit at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. This event is notable for being the stage for the last on-track duel between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna at home in his native Brazil\nSenna was a devout Catholic once saying: \"Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune. It doesn't mean that I'm immortal\".[148] He often read the Bible on long flights from S\u00e3o Paulo to Europe.[149][150] According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: \"On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.\"[148]\n\n\nAs his profile rose, Senna expressed concern over the poor in Brazil. After his death, he was discovered to have secretly donated millions of dollars to help poor children.[151] Shortly before his death, he created the framework for an organisation dedicated to Brazilian children, which later became the Instituto Ayrton Senna (IAS).[152]\n\n\nSenna was awarded the No. 1 driver of the year by the editor of the Autocourse annual 3 times, in 1988, 1991, and 1993, as well as taking the runner-up spot in 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1992. However, Senna was so outraged by the editor dropping him from No. 1 to No. 2 in the 1990 listings as a result of Senna's first corner crash at Suzuka in 1990 with Alain Prost\u2014a piece of driving the editor considered completely reckless\u2014that despite being given the No. 1 driver award in 1991, Senna refused to write the usually customary foreword by the year's World Champion; Honda's Head of Racing wrote the foreword instead. The Autocourse editor wrote in 1993 that Senna had \"intense egocentricity and uniquely flawed genius\" and \"matchless genius in the wet\".[153] In the 2000 edition of Autocourse celebrating 50 years of Formula 1, the editor acknowledged that \"Senna was the one driver who genuinely cared where he was ranked in the Top 10 drivers by the AUTOCOURSE editorial\" and that Senna took being placed below his rivals as a personal slight.[154]\n\n\nSenna was often quoted as using driving as a means for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life, saying, \"The harder I push, the more I find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations, and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation.\"[155]\n\n\nTowards the end of his career, Senna became increasingly preoccupied with the dangers of his profession. On the morning of his death, he initiated the reformation of the GPDA safety organisation, with which he had intended to work to improve the safety of his sport.[156]\n\n\nSenna owned several properties, including an organic farm in Tatu\u00ed, Brazil (where he built a go-kart track in 1991), a beach house in Angra dos Reis, Brazil, an apartment in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, an apartment in Monaco, an estate in Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera, and a house in Algarve, Portugal.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSenna's own \"BAe-125\" private jet (top) in Faro, Portugal with registration N125AS, AS standing for his initials, and passing time with a model plane (bottom)\n\nSenna enjoyed a range of physical activities including running, waterskiing, jet skiing, and paddleboarding. He also had several hobbies, such as flying real and model planes and helicopters,[158] boating, fishing, and riding his favourite Ducati motorbikes. His private jet was a British Aerospace 125, and he also piloted his own helicopter between his residences in Brazil along with travelling to races.[159] For his 29th birthday in 1989, the Brazilian Air Force gave Senna a flight on one of their jet fighters (a Dassault Mirage III), which bears commemorative livery and is now exhibited at the Aerospace Museum of Rio de Janeiro.[160] After a 3 ship flyover of the type at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix, Senna was given a joyride in an RAAF F-111C[161]\n\n\nSenna was close friends with McLaren teammate Gerhard Berger, and the two were always playing practical jokes on each other.[162] Berger is quoted as saying, \"He taught me a lot about our sport, I taught him to laugh.\"[163] In the documentary film *The Right to Win*, made in 2004 as a tribute to Senna, Frank Williams notably recalls that as good a driver as Senna was, ultimately \"he was an even greater man outside of the car than he was in it.\"\n\n\nIn 1992, Senna received a fine and a temporary driving ban in the UK after driving a Porsche at speeds up to 121\u00a0mph (194.7\u00a0km/h) on the M25 near London.[164]\n\n\nSenna was married to Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza from 1981 until 1982. Vasconcelos, whom he had known since childhood, had difficulty adapting to her husband's racing life in England. Vasconcelos later said: \"I was his second passion. His first passion was racing... There was nothing more important in the world for him, not family, not wife, nothing.\"[165] Though he did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father out of a sense of pride.[166] The marriage ended in divorce. Senna then courted Adriane Yamin, daughter of an entrepreneur from S\u00e3o Paulo, who was 15 years old when they began the relationship in 1985 and often chaperoned by her mother during meetings with Senna. They were briefly engaged, but the relationship was broken off by Senna in late 1988.[167] Senna dated Brazilian TV star Xuxa from late 1988 until 1990. He then dated Christine Ferracciu, who lived with him at his homes in Monaco and Portugal, on and off between 1990 and 1991.[167] Senna also had an affair with American model Carol Alt,[168] and briefly dated models Marjorie Andrade and Elle Macpherson.[167][169] At the time of his death, Senna was in a relationship with Brazilian model, and later TV personality, Adriane Galisteu.[170]\n\n\nOne of the most extravagant claims involving Senna's past partners was made by Edilaine de Barros, a former model better known as Marcella Praddo. She alleged that the couple dated from 1992 to 1994. Barros' child, Victoria, was born weeks after Senna's death, and claims that Senna was the father were soon made but abandoned following their rejection by the Senna family. Years later, after joining a religious sect, the former model was convinced to sue against the estate of Senna. In 2000, DNA tests of hair and saliva samples given by Senna's parents conclusively proved that he was not the father of de Barros' child.[171]\n\n\nIn his early years in Formula One, Senna was the subject of a smear campaign orchestrated by Nelson Piquet, ranging from Senna being regarded as a taxi driver to being homosexual given his failed marriage.[172] According to a 1990 interview by Brazilian edition of *Playboy*, Senna declared that he lost his virginity at 13 years of age to a prostitute arranged by his cousin, and he also insinuated that he had a relationship with Piquet's would-be wife (hence Piquet's acrimony).[172]\n\n\nFormer Formula One driver Bruno Senna is the nephew of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: \"If you think I'm fast, just wait until you see my nephew Bruno.\"[173] Due to the death of his uncle, Bruno initially gave up motor racing at his family's insistence.[174] He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.[175]\n\n\n\n## Non-racing commercial activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of Senna's NSXs on display at the Goodwood Festival of Speed\nIn the late 1980s, to take advantage of the relationship Honda had formed with Senna, the Japanese company asked him to help fine-tune the Honda NSX's suspension setting during its final development stages. Test runs were conducted at various circuits, including five sessions with prototypes at the Suzuka Circuit where chief NSX engineer Shigeru Uehara and his team were present to gather Senna's direct input.[176] Senna found the prototype NSX initially lacked chassis stiffness to the level to which he was accustomed, so the final production version was further reinforced to his satisfaction.[177]\n\n\nSenna reportedly had access to three of these cars: a black 1993 NSX in Brazil, which he ordered to his specifications, bearing license plate BSS-8888, which represents his initials for \"Beco\" \u2013 his childhood nickname \u2013 \"Senna da Silva\" and 8 to commemorate his first F1 championship in 1988; a red one with licence plate SX-25-59, which was loaned to him by Honda Portugal; a black one purchased by Antonio Carlos de Almeida Braga, who was a close personal friend, manager, and mentor of Ayrton Senna.[178]\nSenna also appeared in different commercials for the 4th generation Honda Prelude.\n\n\nSenna was also instrumental in bringing Audi cars into his native country, both as an import and manufacturing business. Audi entered Brazil in 1994 via Senna's company, Senna Import, founded in 1993. Sales began in April that year, just a month before his untimely death. In 1999, Audi Senna was created as a joint venture of Audi with Senna Import.[179] Aside from the black NSX mentioned above, Senna's other personal car in 1994 was a silver Audi 100 S4 Avant.[180][181]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Senna developed his own merchandise brand represented by a logo with a double S, after his full surname, \"Senna da Silva\".[182] This logo is meant to represent an S chicane on a racing circuit. The Senna brand was used for apparel, watches, bicycles (Carraro), motorcycles and boats. Hublot,[183] TAG Heuer,[184] and Universal Gen\u00e8ve[185] have created limited-edition watches to honour Senna, both during his lifetime and after his death.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Ayrton Senna at the Parco delle Acque Minerali by the Tamburello corner of the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Italy\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long and excessively detailed.** Please consider summarizing the material. *(April 2023)*\n |\n\n\nMany safety improvements were made in the sport following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths and Barrichello's crash. These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner and other parts of the Imola circuit were altered for 1995. This was despite calls for action in 1989, after a serious high-speed crash in which Senna's friend, Gerhard Berger, suffered burns to his hand. No action took place after that crash because, following an inspection by Senna and Berger, they ended up siding with officials who had, for years, claimed that the wall could not be moved further back due to a river nearby.[186] Revised on-track medical procedures also saw personnel hold up curtains at crash sites, to prevent the public from viewing distressing images as had occurred on live television with Senna.\n\n\nIn July 1994, the Brazil national football team dedicated their World Cup victory to Senna, and collectively held a banner on the field after defeating Italy in the final.[187][188] Senna had met various members of the squad, including Ronaldo[189] and Leonardo, three months earlier in Paris, telling them \"this is our year\".[190][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Throughout the rest of the 1994 season, Senna was commemorated in various ways. Damon Hill, along with Michael Schumacher, dedicated their individual success to Senna with Hill's victory in the Spanish Grand Prix and Schumacher's world-championship victory in the Australian Grand Prix.[191][192]\n\n\nA few months before his death, Senna had discussed with his sister the foundation of a charitable organization, based on a desire to contribute to those less fortunate in a more organised and effective manner. After his death, Viviane Senna set up the Instituto Ayrton Senna in his honour, which has invested nearly US$80\u00a0million over the last 12 years in social programs and actions in partnership with schools, government, NGOs, and the private sector, aimed at offering children and teenagers from low-income backgrounds the skills and opportunities they need to develop their full potential as persons, citizens, and future professionals.[193] The foundation is officially advised by Bernie Ecclestone, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger. The Senninha (\"Little Senna\") cartoon character, born in 1993/94, was another means by which Senna extended his role-model status in favour of Brazilian children.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senninha\n![](image)A monument dedicated to Senna's Formula 1 racing, located at the entrance of the tunnel under Ibirapuera Park in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nIn his home country of Brazil, the main freeway from the international airport to S\u00e3o Paulo and a tunnel along the route to the heart of the city are named in his honour. Also, one of the most important freeways of Rio de Janeiro is named after Senna (\"Avenida Ayrton Senna\"). The main road in Senna's Portuguese resort at Quinta do Lago, Algarve, was also dedicated to him, because his villa there was very near (but not on) this road. A portion of the Interlagos Circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo is named the \"Senna Esse Chicane\" in his honour and decorated with commissioned art from beloved Brazilian artist Luciana Bermelho. In the English town of Reading, Berkshire, where Senna lived for a short period of time, a street in the suburb of Tilehurst was named after him.[195]\n\n\nIn April 2000, Senna was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.[196] That year, the UK public also voted Senna's opening lap of the 1993 European Grand Prix, the 43rd in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[197]\n\n\nIn 2004, a book called *Ayrton: The Hero Revealed* (original title: *Ayrton: O Her\u00f3i Revelado*[198]) was published in Brazil for the 10th anniversary of his death. Senna remains a national hero in Brazil and his grave attracts more visitors than the graves of John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley combined.[149]\n\n\nIn addition, to mark the 10th anniversary of Senna's death, on 21 April 2004, over 10,000 people attended a charity match in a football stadium near Imola. The game was organised by several devoted Italian and Canadian fans of Senna, bringing the Brazil team that won the 1994 World Cup to face the \"Nazionale Piloti\", an exhibition team composed exclusively of top race car drivers. Senna had been a part of the latter in 1985. Michael Schumacher, Jarno Trulli, Rubens Barrichello, Fernando Alonso, and many others faced the likes of Dunga, Careca, Taffarel, and several of the team that won the FIFA World Cup in the United States 10 years earlier. The match finished 5\u20135 and the money was donated to the IAS. Viviane Senna, the president of the IAS, was also involved in the kick-off of this match. That same weekend, Bernie Ecclestone revealed that he still believed Senna was and remained the best F1 driver he had ever seen.[135]\n\n\nSince his death, Senna has been the subject of several songs (either wholly dedicated to him or simply referring to him) including by: Italian singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla (song titled \"Ayrton\"[199]), Italian rock band The Rock Alchemist, whose 2012 song \"Live or Die\" and their 2018 video for \"Live Or Die\" are inspired by the life and character of Ayrton Senna, Jazz pianist Kim Pensyl; Japanese jazz-fusion guitarist and T-square bandleader Masahiro Andoh (references in songs such as \"Faces\" and subsequent revisions, like \"The Face\"); Chris Rea (on his song \"Saudade\"); Spanish band Delorean (2009 extended play entitled *Ayrton Senna*); British acid jazz band Corduroy (1994 song \"Ayrton Senna\").\n\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, to pay tribute to Senna, the Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati produced three special \"Senna\" editions of their 916 superbike. Ducati was at the time owned by Claudio Castiglioni, a personal friend of Senna who was an avid Ducati owner and endorsed the release of this 916 in March 1994. In 2002, under the presidency of Castiglioni, MV Agusta also released the special-edition F4 750 Senna motorbike followed by the F4 Senna 1000 in 2006. In both instances, each edition was limited to 300 units and, just like with the Ducati, all profits from sales were donated to the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[200] In 2013, Ducati also released a special edition of their new top-of-the-range sportbike, the 1199 Panigale S Senna.[201] In 2014, the IAS commissioned a commemorative Vespa that was auctioned for charity. It was custom-painted in the colours of Ayrton Senna's helmet by Alan Mosca, the son of Senna's helmet design creator, Sid, based on more than 50 \"T5 Pole Position\" models of the PX125 scooter that Ayrton won as part of the award to Formula 1 polesitters introduced by Piaggio in 1985.[202]\n\n\nSince 1995, the first season after Senna's tragic death, every Williams F1 car displayed a small 'S' logo on its nose to honour their former driver and in support of the IAS.[203][204] A revised logo was featured in 2014 for the 20th anniversary of the driver's death.[203] In February 2022, however, the 'S' logo was removed from the livery of the Williams FW44, the team's first car to have been developed wholly under new owners, Dorilton Capital.[204] When asked about this decision, team principal Jost Capito stated that the team wanted to \"move on in the future\" and stop reminding its drivers of Senna's fatal accident, while also revealing plans to open a new space fully dedicated to the Brazilian driver in Williams' own museum, instead.[204] Capito admitted that Senna's family did not get involved in the decision to remove the logo, but said that efforts to tighten the team's ties with the Instituto Ayrton Senna were under way.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Senna Chicane\" at the Adelaide Street Circuit, South Australia\n![](image)Ayrton Senna's statue in Wa\u0142brzych, Poland\nThe organisers of the former Formula One Grand Prix street circuit in Adelaide, South Australia, renamed the first chicane the \"Senna Chicane\" in his honour in 1994, and also a road in the Adelaide suburb of Wingfield is named \"Senna Road\".[205] A shortened version of the Adelaide circuit (which remains the site of Senna's last Formula One win) and the chicane remain in use for local motorsport events, and a commemorative concrete plaque installed in 1995, bearing Senna's signature and hand prints, is also located there.[206] The Adelaide circuit was said to be a favourite of Senna's, and he was reportedly unhappy about the upcoming shift of venue from Adelaide to Melbourne in 1996.[207] Other motorsports circuits have similarly named sections of their track after Senna, such as the Circuito de Jerez in Spain, Hockenheimring in Germany, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Canada, the Snetterton Circuit in the UK, the Circuito do Estoril in Portugal, and the Aut\u00f3dromo Juan y Oscar G\u00e1lvez in Argentina.\n\n\nHe has been voted the best driver of all time in various motorsport polls, including *F1 Racing* magazine's 2004 poll, and German newspaper *Bild am Sonntag*'s poll of current drivers in 2010.[208] In 2009, a poll of 217 current and former Formula One drivers conducted by *Autosport* magazine named Senna as \"the greatest Formula One driver who ever lived\".[209][210] In 2012, *BBC Sport* journalists voted Senna as the greatest Formula One driver of all time, after naming their top 20 greatest drivers in a countdown on their website.[211] In 1993, a poll of F1 drivers gave Senna a near-unanimous vote as the best driver in F1.[212]\n\n\nThe Japanese public ranked Senna 22nd in a 2006 survey of their favourite persons in history.[213] The results were part of *The Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan* program broadcast by Nippon TV on 7 May that year.[214]\n\n\nIn 2007, Prince Albert of Monaco unveiled a plaque in honour of Senna in a ceremony that was attended by Vivane Senna. An exhibition also took place that showcased Senna's victories around Monaco, along with his helmets that were borrowed from Senna's family and a selection of McLaren cars raced by Senna that were brought over from Motegi.[215]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2010, on the day that would have marked Senna's 50th birthday, the football team Corinthians, which Senna supported, played a tape in memory of Senna which was also part of the theme played at the S\u00e3o Paulo Motor Show.[216]\n\n\nOn 25 July 2010, the BBC motoring show, *Top Gear* paid tribute to Senna with British Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton driving Senna's original MP4/4, with which he won the 1988 title. This was prior to the release of the BAFTA Award winning documentary named after him, *Senna*, directed by Asif Kapadia. In this documentary broadcast only once by the BBC, Senna is named the number one driver ever, by fellow racing drivers. A StudioCanal, Working Title Films, and Midfield Films documentary production, *Senna* was released to critical acclaim.[217]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Honda released a video of an audio-visual tribute on the Suzuka circuit in the dark, titled \"Sound of Honda \u2013 Ayrton Senna 1989\". Using the telemetry and sound of the Honda-powered McLaren MP4/5 driven by the Brazilian driver, Honda recreated the then lap record lap of 1:38.041 minutes by positioning speakers and lights along the 5.8\u00a0km track and activating them in synchronization with the race car's position during that lap.[218] In May of that year, Honda also reconfirmed its return to the sport as McLaren's engine supplier from 2015, with both companies again leveraging on Senna's legend as part of their advertising campaign since.[219][220]\n\n\nOn 25 October 2013, a holiday PlayStation 3 bundle with Gran Turismo 6 was announced which is dedicated to his memory, with some of the proceeds of this bundle going to help the IAS.[221] This was not the first time that Senna was immortalized in a video game since, in 1992, Sega developed and published *Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II* for the Sega Mega Drive, Master System and Game Gear. Apart from featuring advice from Senna himself, the tracks included Senna's own farm circuit in Tatu\u00ed, S\u00e3o Paulo and it was based on the 1991 F1 World Championship (albeit with fictitious rival drivers and teams due to licensing restrictions). This was then followed by the Japan-exclusive *Ayrton Senna Personal Talk: Message for the Future* for the Sega Saturn, which was a multimedia compact disc containing interviews with Senna overlaid with still images.\n\n\nIn March 2014, during the Brazilian Carnival celebrations, the samba group Unidos da Tijuca paid tribute to Senna in one of their parades in Rio de Janeiro. The group showcased his McLaren car along with other characters associated with speed, such as Sonic, The Flash, and Usain Bolt. The school won the coveted trophy for the best parade of 2014.[222]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2014, Google had a special Doodle to honour Senna's 54th birthday that day.[223]\n\n\nIn occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, on 29 April 2014, in partnership with the IAS, the Brazilian regional airline Azul Linhas Aereas paid tribute by baptizing its Embraer ERJ-195 (registration no. PR-AYU (cn 19000434)) with a new name and livery. The airplane, which was formerly called \"Azultec\", has been renamed \"#sennasempre\" (\"Senna forever\") and features the IAS logo on the rear side of the fuselage and the graphics of Senna's F1 helmet at the front, making it appear as though it is wearing the iconic helmet.[224][225]\n\n\nTributes were also made at the Imola circuit to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death.[226][227] On 1 May 2014, thousands of fans from around the world gathered at the Tamburello corner, at the exact scene where Senna suffered his fatal crash 20 years earlier, to hold a minute's silence. Various current and former F1 drivers were in attendance, including: Ferrari drivers Fernando Alonso and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen; Ferrari Driver Academy member Jules Bianchi; Senna's close friend and McLaren teammate, Gerhard Berger; and the Italians Jarno Trulli, Ivan Capelli, Pierluigi Martini, Andrea de Cesaris, and Emanuele Pirro.[228] Flowers and other cherishable items were also placed around the statue of Senna, situated directly adjacent to the Tamburello corner.[229]\n\n\nIn May and July 2014, the Republic of San Marino issued 70,008 commemorative EUR 2,50 stamps[230][231] as well as 8,000 silver proof coins in Eur 5,00 denomination.[231] In December 2014, a French company also produced 520 commemorative coins designed by a Brazilian artist.[232] The American firm Rosland Capital collaborated with the Ayrton Senna Institute to produce a commemorative coin collection in 2017.[233]\n\n\nIn November 2014 British artist Ian Berry unveiled a portrait of Ayrton in S\u00e3o Paulo at the Institut Ayrton Senna to the press and the family of Ayrton Senna. The artist famed for his artwork using only jeans presented the piece, that also included the jeans of the Senna family to great acclaim.[234][235] The piece traveled around the world for many fans to see and commemorated the 20th anniversary of his passing.\n\n\nIn 2015, when Lewis Hamilton matched Ayrton's three titles, the Senna family gave him an edition of the Ian Berry portrait made out of the family's jeans, Viviane Senna presented it to him at the S\u00e3o Paulo GP.[236]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2017, after qualifying on pole for the Canadian Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton was presented with a Senna helmet that had been worn by Senna during a race. It was given by Senna's family in recognition of Hamilton's 65th pole position, matching Senna's tally.[237]\n\n\nMcLaren unveiled the McLaren Senna, a 789\u00a0bhp track-focused sports car named after Senna, on 9 December 2017.[238]\n\n\nOn 1 October 2018, Nike and Corinthians partnered with the Ayrton Senna Institute to unveil a never-before-seen collection inspired by the Lotus team's colour scheme and honouring Ayrton Senna, including the team's new third kit. The collection #LuteAt\u00e9SerEterno [fight until you're eternal] was intended as a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the driver's first world title, which he won at Suzuka, in Japan.[239] A half-Austrian, half-Brazilian flag was presented on the top step of the podium by the race winner of the 2019 Spanish Grand Prix in honour of Ratzenberger and Senna.[240]\n\n\nA DLC for Codemasters' *F1 2019* depicting Senna's rivalry with Alain Prost was released in June of the same year: it featured digitalized depictions of the two drivers, along with car liveries inspired by their helmet designs.[241]\n\n\nOn 8 May 2019, a sculpture of Senna by British artist Paul Oz was unveiled in Barcelona to mark the 25th anniversary of the driver's tragic death.[242]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2021, a bronze life-size statue of Ayrton Senna was unveiled in Walbrzych (Poland), standing in a street named after him.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMinor planet 6543 Senna is named in his honor.[243]\n\n\nIn 2020, Netflix announced development on a fictionalized miniseries about Ayrton Senna. Gabriel Leone is set to star, with a predicted release date of 2024.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Helmet design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna's helmet bearing the colours of the Brazilian national flag\nIn his karting days, Senna's helmet consisted of a plain white background with notable features absent. He experimented with several designs to satisfy him, such as a white, yellow, and green helmet,[244] before settling on a design by Sid Mosca that included a yellow background with a green stripe surrounding the upper visor and a light metallic blue stripe surrounding the lower visor (both stripes are delineated in the other stripe's color) that was first seen in 1979; Mosca also painted helmets for Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.\n\n\nAccording to Mosca, the blue and green stripes symbolised movement and aggression, while the overall yellow colour symbolised youth;[9] the three colors were also identifiable with the Flag of Brazil. The helmet never had significant changes, apart from sponsorship. One such change was that Senna occasionally altered the stripe from blue to black. The tone of yellow changed a number of times, while usually a rich sunburst yellow, in 1985 and 1986 in some races, he used a fluorescent neon yellow colour. In 1994, the helmet was a lighter, paler yellow to complement the blue and white of the Williams car. He used a number of helmet brands throughout his career. From 1977 to 1989, he used Bell (Star \u2013 '77 to '82, XFM-1 \u2013 '83 to '89), from 1990 to 1991 Honda's own Rheos brand, 1992 to 1993 he used Shoei (X-4) and for 1994 he returned to using Bell (M3 Kevlar).[245] The helmet worn by Senna in the fatal race was returned to Bell in 2002 and was incinerated while family members watched.[246]\n\n\n\n### Third-party adaptations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bruno Senna's helmet design is an adaptation of his uncle's (seen here parading the 1985 Lotus 97T at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix).\nHis nephew Bruno wore a modified version of his helmet design (a yellow helmet with a green and blue stripe) during his Formula One career, but the stripes are shaped after an S rather than being straight, under the chin area it has a green stripe, and it has a blue rounded rectangle in the top area. Bruno sported a modified helmet design for the final three races of the 2011 season to honour the 20th anniversary of Ayrton winning his last world championship.[247]\n\n\nAt the 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello incorporated part of Senna's helmet design into his own.[248] For the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, another variant of Senna's helmet was used by Lewis Hamilton and by Barrichello too. Hamilton used the design with permission from Senna's sister Viviane and the helmet was later sold in support of the IAS.[249] At the 2015 Brazilian Grand Prix, Hamilton again varied his helmet design (this time, the rear only given FIA restrictions on design changes in force from 2015) accompanied with a Twitter announcement stating \"Just for you, Brazil!! A tribute to the greatest\".[250]\n\n\nOutside of motor racing, Brazilian cyclist Murilo Fischer wore a helmet based on Senna's helmet colour scheme of yellow with green and blue stripes on stage 11 of the 2015 Giro d'Italia, which finished on the Imola circuit.[251]\n\n\nFor the 2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, Pierre Gasly wore a special helmet with Senna's colours and the *Senna Sempre* (Senna Forever) badging on top.\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Series\n | Team\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1977\n

In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among others.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season\u2014to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\n\n\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles.\n\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of *Time* as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Hamilton, Lewis' father and then-manager, celebrating with his son after the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix[6]\nHamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.[2] His father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and from Birmingham,[7] making him mixed-race;[8] Hamilton has identified as black.[9] Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.[10] Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.[11][12] Hamilton was raised a Catholic.[13]\n\n\nHamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five.[14] Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition.[15] Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse.[14][16] Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school.[17] To support his son, Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents,[18] while still attending his son's races.[19] Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company.[20] He continued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.[21][22]\n\n\nHamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage.[23] Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school.[24] He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries.[25] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young.[20] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[26] In February 2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[27]\n\n\n\n## Junior racing career[edit]\n\n\n### Karting[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.[28][29] Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\"[18] Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\"[30] When Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25.[31] In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins,[15] to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren driver development programme.[8] The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.[28]\n\n\n\n> \n> He's a quality driver, very strong and only 16. If he keeps this up I'm sure he will reach F1. It's something special to see a kid of his age out on the circuit. He's clearly got the right racing mentality.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Michael Schumacher, speaking about Hamilton in 2001[32]\n\nHamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000.[33] In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.[34]\n\n\n\n### Formula Renault and Formula Three[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.[15] This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall.[35] He remained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.[36] Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship.[37] In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,[38] and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.[39]\n\n\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\".[40] He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.[41] He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix[42] and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.[43][44] Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[45] Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the team's young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a \"huge row\" at the end of the season, with Lewis' father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in F3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Lewis' contract; however, Lewis called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the team.[18]\n\n\nHamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone.[46] Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds.[15] He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.[47] After the season British magazine *Autosport* featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.[15]\n\n\n\n### GP2[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season.[48] Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Alexandre Pr\u00e9mat.[49] He secured a dominant win at the N\u00fcrburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.[50] At his home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.[51] In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.[52] Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.[53]\n\n\nHamilton's success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to Ferrari.[54][55] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.[56] He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.[57]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Lewis Hamilton\n\n### McLaren (2007\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n![A silver Formula One car driving around a corner.](image)Hamilton took his first Formula One win at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix in only his sixth Grand Prix.\nHamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton is the first and, as of 2023[update], the only black driver to race in the series.[58][59][60] After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point, including those for the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109). Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012.[61]\n\n\n\n![A group of people dressed in orange celebrate, with Hamilton in the middle wearing a baseball cap.](image)Hamilton and his team celebrate his maiden Formula One World Championship title in 2008.\nHamilton's success continued in 2008 as he amassed five victories and ten podium finishes. As the season reached its conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title between the home favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion in the last race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth position in the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history and to deny race-winner Massa the title by one point.[62][63] This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.[64]\n\n\n\n> \n> There are people that watch and say that I've never had a bad car. I can assure you I have. 2009's car [at McLaren] was very, very far off and was the worst car that I've had.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Hamilton, in comparing his seasons at McLaren in 2009 and Mercedes in 2022.[65]\n\nIn his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories. Hamilton entered the final round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to form for 2012. Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year, Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher.[66]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2013\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132016: Teammates with Rosberg[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Rosberg endured a tense rivalry in their time as teammates.\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble.[67][68] In his first season with the Silver Arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen,[69] alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[66]\n\n\nChanges to regulations for the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final race in Abu Dhabi: \"This is the greatest day of my life.\"[66] New driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton elected to drive under his old karting No. 44 for the remainder of his career.[70]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career No. 44. It was the first season since 1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field did not contain a car bearing the No. 1.[71] Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the title with three races to spare.[66] That year, Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One,[72][73] as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's engine failure in Malaysia in 2016 was a key moment in the Drivers' Championship fight.\nDespite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track, culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[74] Ultimately, a succession of poor starts from Hamilton early in the season and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia meant Rosberg took the title, which he successfully secured before announcing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.[66][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u20132020: Four titles in a row[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2018 season was the first time in the sport that two four-time World Champions (Hamilton and Vettel) competed for a fifth title.\nThe 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the \"Fight for Five\" by journalists and fans.[76][77][78] As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).[66][75] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[79]\n\n\nHaving signed a contract with Mercedes that lasted until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019.[80] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Bull of Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[81][82] After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole positions.[83] His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.[84]\n\n\nHamilton won his seventh drivers' title in 2020, equalling the record set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[85][86] Over the shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton took 11 wins (equalling his previous personal best, but in fewer races) including one in Portugal to break Schumacher's record of 91 wins.[87] He also took 14 podiums and 10 pole positions. Hamilton missed the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting COVID-19,[88] his first race absence since his debut in 2007.[89] Hamilton clinched the title at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix with three rounds to spare and ended the season 124 points clear of his team-mate, Bottas, who finished second in the standings.[90] Amid Formula One's *We Race as One* campaign and growing global support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Hamilton took the knee ahead of every race he entered and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Hamilton and Bottas' W11 cars also sported a black livery as a statement of Mercedes' commitment to diversity.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season: Title battle vs. Verstappen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Verstappen engaged in several on-track battles throughout the 2021 season. Pictured is the 2021 United States Grand Prix.\nEarly on in the 2021 season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen emerged as title favourites.[93] The pair frequently exchanged the championship lead throughout the season\u2014often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track\u2014and entered the last race in Abu Dhabi level on points. In Abu Dhabi, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the race, denying Hamilton his eighth title. During the season, Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 pole positions and 100 race wins, respectively.[94][95]\n\n\nThe season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi's decision to instruct only the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which eliminated any gap between the pair and allowed the Dutchman, running newly fitted soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton on his worn hard tyres.[96][97] Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident.[98] Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director,[99] with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that \"human error\" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, but also that the final standings \"are valid, final and cannot now be changed.\"[100] Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the season as \"one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history\", with Hamilton and Verstappen having \"been head and shoulders\u2014and a lot more\u2014clear of every other driver on the grid.\"[96]\n\n\n\n#### 2022\u20132023: First winless season in Formula One and Mercedes struggles[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton 2022](image)Hamilton during free practice at the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\nHamilton was partnered by George Russell for 2022, in place of the departing Bottas.[101] The season saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise ground effect to generate downforce. During pre-season testing in Bahrain, Mercedes introduced its \"zero sidepod\" car design, which was radically different to that of its competitors. The Mercedes W13 suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season which limited the car's potential;[102] at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the car \"undrivable\".[103] During the first half of the season, Hamilton was marginally low on points compared to Russell, despite having been involved in the development of the W13, he had to try on experimental car setups until the British Grand Prix. As his car development contributions were concluded, he was able to perform better. Hamilton scored more podium finishes and championship points than Russell during the second half of the season.[104] During the season Hamilton set records such as, most consecutive seasons with at least one podium finish, most consecutive seasons with at least one lap led, most races with a single constructor, most Q3 appearances, most top 10 finishes and most chequered flags reached at the Monaco Grand Prix, most podium finishes at a single circuit, most points scored at the Monza Circuit and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix.[105]\n\n\nBy the end of the season, Hamilton achieved nine podiums but failed to achieve a race win or pole position in a season for the first time in his Formula One career. He finished in sixth place in the drivers' championship, 35 points behind Russell, who finished fourth. But Hamilton managed to qualify on higher grid positions and scored more podium finishes than Russell.[106][107]\n\n\nMercedes started the 2023 season with concerns over their competitiveness, with Hamilton saying they were \"not where they wanted to be\" after preseason testing.[108] He finished fifth in the opening race in Bahrain, over 50 seconds behind the winner Verstappen.[109] Hamilton achieved his first podium of the season in Australia to extend his own record.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton during the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix After back to back podium finishes in Spain and Canada, he fought from seventh on the grid to take third place at his home race at Silverstone.[111][112][113]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix Hamilton qualified 0.003 seconds in front of Verstappen to take his 104th pole position and his first since 2021.[114]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2023, the day before the first practice session of the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract to remain with Mercedes through the 2025 season. George Russell also signed a two-year extension, retaining Mercedes' driver pair.[115] At the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton qualified fifth, but would finish the race in third after inheriting the position after Russell crashed out from third place on the last lap.[116]\n\n\n\n## Driver profile[edit]\n\n\n### Driving style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won by over a minute from second-place Nick Heidfeld at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid,[117] excelling across a wide range of areas.[118] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[119] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\"[120][121] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[120]\n\n\nHamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[122] Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of \"how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed\", highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.[18]\n\n\nHamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[123][124] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.\"[125] Ahead of the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said \"I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or physically.\"[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix in torrential rain, and compared the conditions to his victory at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[127][128] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[129] His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\":[130] despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place.[131][130][132][133][134] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton is the most successful British driver in Formula One history, and has won the British Grand Prix a record eight times.\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.\"[135] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[136] In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna's original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show *Top Gear*. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.[137][138]\n\n\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[139] Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\n> \n> As a driver he is absolutely outstanding \u2013 as good as there's ever been. Apart from the talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One. He is box office, 100 per cent.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015[140]\n\nHamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation,[141][142][130] and one of the greatest Formula One drivers.[143][144][145][146][147] Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[note 2] Jim Holden writing in *Autocar* suggests Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One, but one of the greatest British sportsmen.[156] Despite receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been under-appreciated.[157][158] Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance \u2013 being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing \u2013 alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[156] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[159][156]\n\n\n\n> \n> What strikes me now about him now is his maturity ... [Hamilton] recognises he is a role model and the influence he has and the responsibilities that come with it. He is far broader than purely a driver in [Formula One]. He has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. That is part of the greater appeal of Lewis today.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019[160]\n\nHamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised.[161] He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers.[162][159] Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[162] Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[157]\n\n\nFigures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport, noting how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[161] Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83\u00a0billion as of 31 July 2016.[141] Sports journalist for *The Telegraph*, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[163] Following Hamilton's knighthood in 2020,[164] newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton \"is a true giant of our sport\" and that \"his influence is huge both in and out of a car.\"[165]\n\n\n\n> \n> He was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017[166]\n\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\"[18] After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[20] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[167] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons,[144] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[166][168]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton waving to fans after winning the 2018 Italian Grand Prix\nAfter Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[142] an opinion which was widely accepted among the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[141] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history.[167] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[169][170] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike,[171][144][166][172][173][143][174][175][176][177] with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[178][179]\n\n\nFollowing Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[150] a sentiment echoed by his Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described him as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\",[157] while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described Hamilton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[117] After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.[153] Herbert compared Hamilton to tennis player Roger Federer and golfer Tiger Woods.[180]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's 2007 helmet\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[181] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach.[182] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[183] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time, on either side.[184] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's helmet in 2013\nHamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, he sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[186] At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought with him a striking blue-and-green design in honour of team sponsor Petronas but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[187] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words *World Champion*.[188] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title, towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[185] and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[189]\n\n\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[190] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career, saying: \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[191] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix.[192]\n\n\nHamilton switched into a different design in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in support of Black Lives Matter, he also continued to use the same design in 2021.[193] Hamilton wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in support of the LGBTQ+ community.[194] Ahead of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it also used purple details.[195] He also used one-off designs for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.[196][197][198] Hamilton retained the yellow helmet design in 2023.[199]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n#### Fernando Alonso[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alonso (left) and Hamilton (right) at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007.[200] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[201] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"[201]\n\n\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary.[18] Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[202] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[203] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[204] British motorsport journal *Autosport* claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[205] however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.[206]\n\n\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[207][208] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[209] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[210][211][212] Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[213] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[214] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[166] Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[143] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[215]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. Hamilton had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Alonso 10 times. Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of Hamilton only 7 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Nico Rosberg[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hamilton\u2013Rosberg rivalry\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Rosberg (right) at the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[217] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\"[218] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[218] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing.[20]\n\n\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability but with an intellect to match Rosberg's.[139] Buxton wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Man to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his tires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't used too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.[139]\n> \n> \n\n\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[20] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage.[139] However, Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.\"[118][219]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times. Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[220]\n\n\n\n#### Sebastian Vettel[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel 2017 United States GP (38000070491)](image)Hamilton (left) and Vettel (right) at the 2017 United States Grand Prix\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together.[221] After three years of Mercedes' dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018.[222][223][224][225] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty,[226] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight.[227][228][229] In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\n\n\n\n> Mine and Seb's battle were my favourite so far. It's knowing I was racing against an incredible driver, not only that but a great man in Seb who is a four-time world champion and we were racing against another team, he was at Ferrari who were very strong at the time. It took a lot out of both of us in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. That was a difficult period for us and it brought us closer, because the respect we have between us is huge.[230]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\n### Racist treatment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton was racially abused by fans during 2010 pre-season testing at Jerez.\nThe first and, as of 2023, the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix.[231] In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [*sic*]\".[232] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour,[233] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[234] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named *pinchalaruedadeHamilton*, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[235] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.[236]\n\n\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, *The Guardian* journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public.[237] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[238] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[239] and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport.[240] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[241]\n\n\n\n### Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n#### Diversity and anti-racism[edit]\n\n\n> \n> People come up to me from different ethnic backgrounds saying, \"My kid wants to be you one day\", and I can assure you that when I started racing, there weren't people from those [ethnic backgrounds]. I take great pride in that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Hamilton in 2017 commenting on his influence on minority representation in Formula One[242]\n\nHamilton is a prominent advocate against racism and for increased diversity in motorsport.[243][244] He has questioned racial politics in Formula One on several occasions. In 2011, after being summoned to the stewards in five out of the first six races of the season, Hamilton quipped, \"Maybe it's because I'm black, that's what Ali G says.\"[245] In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, describing how nothing had changed in his eleven years in the sport before saying: \"Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in.\"[246][247]\n\n\nHamilton took the knee before every race he entered in the 2020 Formula One season in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Following the murder of George Floyd while being arrested in May 2020, which sparked national and global protests,[248] Hamilton criticised prominent figures in Formula One for their silence on the issue, writing on Instagram:\n\n\n\n\n> I see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice. Not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport. I'm one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. ... I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can't stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are and I see you. ... I do not stand with those looting and burning buildings but those who are protesting peacefully. There can be no peace until our so called leaders make change. This is not just America, this is the UK, this is Spain, this is Italy and all over. ... The way minorities are treated has to change, how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.[249][250][251][252]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing Hamilton's comments, several drivers released statements about Floyd's murder and voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and support was expressed from other figures in the sport such as Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss.[253][249] Ross Brawn, managing director for Formula One, said that the organisation \"supports [Hamilton] totally\", describing Hamilton as \"a great ambassador for the sport\". He acknowledged that Hamilton's comments \"are very valid\" and that the sport \"can give greater opportunity for minority and ethnic groups to get involved in motorsport\". Brawn stated that Formula One was working to increase diversity within the sport, with efforts targeted at increasing driving opportunities at grassroots level as well as across all roles in Formula One.[254]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix weekend, including on the podium, Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing \"Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\" on the front and \"Say her name\" with a photo of Taylor on the back, in reference to the killing of Breonna Taylor. Following an investigation, the FIA announced that only race suits done up to the neck can be worn on the podium and that only official team attire can be worn in the media pen.[255] In anticipation of the FIA's decision, Hamilton said that he recognised that they have \"certain limits that they feel that they have to work within\", but he \"[didn't] regret a single moment of it\" and cited the \"really positive support from the fans\".[244]\n\n\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Hamilton had established The Hamilton Commission with the Royal Academy of Engineering. The commission had been in development since December 2019 but publicly launched to coincide with the heightened media and public interest in the Black Lives Matter movement, and greater scrutiny of race inequality in society. The partnership with the Royal Academy of Engineering was established to find ways in which motorsport can engage more young people from black backgrounds with science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects and, ultimately, employ them in motorsport or in other engineering sectors.[256][257] In May 2021, Hamilton become the first recipient of the inaugural Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year Award for his involvement in the fight against racism.[258]\n\n\nBuilding on the recommendations of the Hamilton Commission, Hamilton launched Mission 44, a charitable foundation created to help young people from under-represented backgrounds achieve their ambitions in wider society, in July 2021. Hamilton pledged \u00a320m of his personal wealth to support the work of the charity, including supporting organisations and programmes that narrow the gap in employment and education.[259] Mission 44 will work in conjunction with a joint charitable foundation between Hamilton and the Mercedes Formula One team, called Ignite, which was also launched in July 2021.[260] Ignite focuses on increasing diversity in motorsport, by improving educational opportunities and offering financial support.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hamilton confronted the Bahrain's human rights abuses and spoke out on the allegations of sportswashing. Hamilton said he \"won't let it go unnoticed\" after an 11-year-old boy, Ahmed Ramadhan, wrote a letter to Hamilton, asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty, after a confession was allegedly extracted through torture for the death of a policeman.[262][263] Hamilton spoke to human rights organisations and legal experts. He also spoke with Bahraini officials about the country's human rights. The F1 champion said that while he had no authority to choose the location for his race, \"going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places\" is not the right way.[264] In July 2021, Hamilton spoke out against the \"cowardly\" anti-LGBT laws in Hungary, after the country introduced a law that limits discussions of LGBT sexualities in school.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental and animal rights[edit]\n\n\nHamilton has repeatedly discussed environmental issues and animal rights at conferences, in interviews and in documentaries.[266][267] He also uses his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives,[268] which range from urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock,[269] and backing charities which fight the illegal wildlife trade,[270] to calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest.[271] In January 2020, he donated US$500,000 (approximately \u00a3383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the bushfire crisis in Australia.[272] The money went towards the fire services and animal welfare charities.[273]\n\n\nIn 2019, Hamilton asked Mercedes-Benz to swap animal-derived leather in the company's models worldwide: \"I am trying to push for sustainability with my team. I am trying to get\u00a0more involved in Formula 1 and be more conscious*.* Mercedes-Benz is a huge organisation. I have got a phone call with the CEO later today to discuss how we can work on getting rid of all the leather supplied to the cars. That is something I want to be involved in.\"[274][275] The next year, he announced his aim of being carbon neutral by the end of the year, saying: \"I don't allow anyone in my office, but also within my household, to buy any plastics. I want everything recyclable, down to deodorant, down to toothbrush, all these kinds of things ... I'm trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space. I sold my plane over a year ago. I fly a lot less now. I'm trying to fly less through the year.\"[276]\n\n\n\n#### UNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Hamilton began working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In March 2012, Hamilton travelled to the Philippines where he made a short film about Manila's street children. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid and helped raise over \u00a34.9 million for UNICEF.[277][278][279] In October 2012, while in India for the Grand Prix, Hamilton visited a UNICEF-funded newborn care unit and nutrition centre. Hamilton said: \"As a sportsman in the public eye, I know I have a role to play in helping to tell the stories of the world's most vulnerable children and I jumped at the chance to be able to do that again after a visit to Manila.\"[280][281][282]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hamilton travelled to Haiti where he made a short film about child malnutrition. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid, and helped raise over \u00a36 million for UNICEF.[283][284][285] In 2015, Hamilton took part in an exhibition to highlight UNICEF's work and to celebrate\u00a0its twenty-year partnership with Starwood Hotels.[286][287] In June 2017, Hamilton joined the Super Dads initiative, a special UNICEF campaign that highlighted the critical role played by fathers in early childhood development.[288][289][290] In August 2017, Hamilton visited Havana with UNICEF to learn more about its first development programmes in Cuba.[291][292]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hamilton partnered with charity campaign #TOGETHERBAND to help promote the United Nations' 17 Global Goals. As part of his campaign work, Hamilton visited Alperton Community School in North West London to speak to the students about the importance of education. Hamilton is a GOAL 4 Ambassador, focusing on the fight to provide quality education to all children.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other charities[edit]\n\n\nOver the past decade, Hamilton has made time for a variety of good causes, such as making hospital visits to sick children.[294][295] He has invited fans, young people, and their families to join him at Grand Prix races and social events.[296][297][298][299][300] In 2013, he became the Global Education Ambassador for Save the Children, supporting and promoting its education campaigns.[301][302][303] Two years later, Hamilton became the first ambassador for the Invictus Games Foundation, supporting wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.[304][305][306] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamilton's Neat Burger restaurant donated free meals to frontline NHS workers.[307][308] Neat Burger also launched the \"Kids Eat Free\" scheme, serving free meals to school children during the half-term break.[309][310]\n\n\nHamilton often donates personal and professional paraphernalia for charity auctions.[311][312][313][314] He auctioned a racing kart and raised over \u00a342,000 for baby charity Tommy's.[28] He raised \u00a36,411 for the Small Steps Project in 2018, and \u00a36,000 in 2019.[315] In 2020, he raised another \u00a34,000 for the Small Steps Project, while a donated race suit reportedly raised \u20ac20,000 for vulnerable children.[316][*citation needed*]\n\n\nHamilton frequently attends charitable functions[317][318][319][320] and has supported projects and charities such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation,[321] Comic Relief,[322] Rays of Sunshine,[323] Children in Need,[324] and Stevenage's Keech Hospice Care Children's Service, among others.[325] He is also involved in charitable work through the creation of his Lewis Hamilton Foundation. Registered in June 2008, the foundation provides grants and donations to a number of charitable causes.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Media reception[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and noted that people felt \"very offended\".[328] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[329] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[330]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Hamilton at Madame Tussauds, London\nHamilton's contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the *Powerlist*, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017.[331][332] In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th *Powerlist*, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement.[333][334] In 2020, he was listed as one of *Time* magazine's 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.[335][336][337]\n\n\nHamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.[338][339][340] That year, Hamilton received criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[341] Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying \u00a33.3\u00a0million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth \u00a316.5\u00a0million.[342] According to BBC *Panorama*, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be \"artificial\" and \"did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use\". The BBC also said that Hamilton's Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips.[342] The jet was sold in September 2019.[343] Despite not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told *The Sunday Times* in 2014: \"What people don't realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here [UK] as well. I am contributing to the country.\"[344][345]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nHamilton also has interests in music, saying that \"music has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don't get to see.\"[346] He features on Christina Aguilera's 2018 song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym XNDA, although he did not confirm this until July 2020, when he revealed he had been writing and recording music for ten years.[347][348] Hamilton also made a guest appearance in *Cars 2* (2011) in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself.[349] He then voiced a voice command assistant in *Cars 3* (2017).[350] Hamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film *The Game Changers*.[351] Hamilton has also revealed he was offered a role as a fighter pilot in the film *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) by Tom Cruise, but was forced to decline due to his Formula One commitments.[352]\n\n\nHe was also served as the \"maestro\" of the *Gran Turismo* series since *Gran Turismo Sport* in 2017[353] and his Time Trial Challenge DLC pack was released in that said game on 28 November 2019.[354]\n\n\nIn 2018, Hamilton launched the clothing line TOMMYXLEWIS during New York Fashion Week with American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin.[355] Hamilton stated \"[g]rowing up, I remember seeing the iconic Tommy Hilfiger flag\" and Hilfiger commented on Hamilton, saying that \"Lewis is bold in everything he does ... He's not afraid to take risks. And he has a cool and sophisticated style that really speaks to the new generation of Tommy fans.\"[356]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Hamilton launched a vegan restaurant named Neat Burger.[357] It claims to be the first international plant-based burger chain.[358] In 2020, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant of the Year at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards.[359] In August 2020, *Daily Front Row* listed Hamilton as one of a group of high-profile investors who purchased *W*, a troubled fashion magazine.[360] In 2021, for the second consecutive year, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards. Neat Burger was also named People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals's inaugural Company of the Year.[361]\n\n\nHamilton also became an Ambassador for the luxury watch company IWC, owned by Richemont. Throughout 2021, Hamilton toured the world via PORTL hologram, first in Europe and then making its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in September.[362]\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, Hamilton launched Team X44 to compete in the all-electric SUV off-road racing series Extreme E from the 2021 season on.[363] The X44 team finished 2nd in the inaugural Extreme E championship, behind Nico Rosberg's RXR team.[364] In January 2022, X44 were crowned inaugural winners of Extreme E Sustainability Award.[365] The team won the 2022 Championship in the final race of the season, beating RXR, who were disqualified from the race.[366]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Hamilton joined the newly-established ownership group of the National Football League's Denver Broncos.[367]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Hamilton founded the production company, Dawn Apollo Films. Its upcoming debut projects include an untitled sports action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski, and an untitled documentary film about Hamilton. Both projects will be co-produced by Hamilton, and released on Apple TV+.[368]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Epic Games added a cosmetic Hamilton player skin to *Fortnite*. A likeness of Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, was also added to the game.[369]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because \"[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world ... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"[370] In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism.[371] In 2018, Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\".[372] His racing number has always been 44 because when he started racing at age 8 his father's red Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate \"F44\" and it was his father's idea to use it.[373]\n\n\nHamilton is a fan of art and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol.[374] Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol's *Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe* painting hanging from a chain around his neck.[375] From November 2007 to February 2015, Hamilton was in an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl group Pussycat Dolls.[376][377]\n\n\nHamilton is a Catholic; he says that he prays regularly and is guided by his faith.[378] Hamilton believes that he has the \"hand of God\" resting over him when racing in Formula One.[379][380] Hamilton is also a supporter of LGBT rights, and strongly criticised the Hungarian government before the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix,[381] while also calling out the \"terrifying\" Saudi Arabian LGBT laws before that Grand Prix.[382]\n\n\nOn 14 March 2022, Hamilton revealed that he is in the process of legally changing his name to include his mother's maiden name, Larbalestier, as a middle name.[383] On 9 June 2022, Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil after a proposal made by politician Andr\u00e9 Figueiredo was passed in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.[384]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month after being caught speeding at 196\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph) on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded.[385][386] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\". After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (\u00a3288), being described as a \"hoon\" by the magistrate.[387][388][389]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton's rights management company 44IP opposed Swatch Group's application to register a trade mark for \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" in Europe for the sale of watches and timepieces. This was likely to have been encouraged, or even required, by Hamilton's own watch sponsor. 44IP alleged that Swatch Group's application was made in bad faith and that it was contrary to \"fair competition\" in relation to 44IP's existing \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" mark. In 2020, the case was heard before the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO rejected 44IP's arguments, ruling that there had been no bad faith by Swatch Group (with \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" having been used on relevant goods since 1892) and that 44IP's \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" trade mark did not extend to the word \"HAMILTON\" alone for the purposes of protecting the existing mark.[390]\n\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK. He later said on the television show *Parkinson* that taxation was also a factor in his decision.[391][392][393]\n\n\nIn 2010, Hamilton, like many other Formula One drivers, moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported \u00a310\u00a0million. Hamilton also owns an apartment in Manhattan, New York which he bought for US$40\u00a0million in 2017, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would live after his retirement.[394]\n\n\n\n### Wealth and income[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a388\u00a0million.[395] In 2018, it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of \u00a3159\u00a0million.[396] In 2020, Hamilton's fortune was an estimated \u00a3224 million, making him the richest British sports star in the history of the *Sunday Times Rich List*.[397]\n\n\nBefore the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix weekend, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One.[72] In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One.[79] According to *Forbes*, Hamilton was one of the highest-paid athletes of twenty-tens decade,[398] and also the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021.[399]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

Schumacher has a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Lewis Hamilton) and, at the time of his retirement from the sport in 2012, he held the records for the most wins (91), pole positions (68), and podium finishes (155)\u2014which have since been broken by Hamilton\u2014while he maintains the record for the number of total fastest laps (77), among others.\n\n\nBorn to working-class parents, Schumacher started his racing career in karting. He won his first karting championship aged six in a kart built from discarded parts. After having enjoyed success in karting\u2014such as winning the 1987 European karting championship\u2014and in several single-seater series, Schumacher made a one-off Formula One appearance with Jordan at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix. He was signed by Benetton for the rest of the 1991 season. He won his first and second drivers' titles consecutively in 1994 and 1995. Schumacher moved to the struggling Ferrari team in 1996. During his first years at the team, Schumacher lost out on the title in the final race of the season in 1997 and 1998 and suffered a broken leg from a brake failure in 1999. He and Ferrari won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004, including unprecedented sixth and seventh titles, breaking several records. After finishing third in 2005 and second in 2006, Schumacher retired from the sport, although he later made a brief return with Mercedes from 2010 to 2012.\n\n\nSchumacher was noted for pushing his car to the very limit for sustained periods during races, a pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him. He and his younger brother Ralf are the only siblings to win races in Formula One and the first siblings to finish first and second in the same race, a feat they repeated in four subsequent races. Schumacher was twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that decided the title: first with Damon Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, and later with Jacques Villeneuve at the 1997 European Grand Prix.\n\n\nAn ambassador for UNESCO, Schumacher has been involved in humanitarian projects and has donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. In December 2013, Schumacher suffered a severe brain injury in a skiing accident. He was placed in a medically induced coma until June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, before being relocated to his home to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher's title-winning German Formula Three car from 1990\nMichael Schumacher was born in the West German town of H\u00fcrth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3 January 1969, to working-class parents Rolf\u2014a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track\u2014and Elisabeth Schumacher (1948\u20132003), who operated the track's canteen.[1] When Schumacher was four, his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Michael crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts and, at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.[2]\n\n\nRegulations in Germany require a driver to be at least 14 years old to obtain a kart license. To get around this, Schumacher obtained a license in Luxembourg at the age of 12.[3] In 1983, he obtained his German license, a year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship. Schumacher joined Eurokart dealer Adolf Neubert in 1985 and by 1987, he was the German and European kart champion, then he quit school and began working as a mechanic. In 1988, he made his first step into single-seat car racing by participating in the German Formula Ford and Formula K\u00f6nig series, winning the latter.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, Schumacher signed with Willi Weber's WTS Formula Three team. Funded by Weber, he competed in the German Formula Three series, winning the title in 1990.[3] He also won the 1990 Macau Grand Prix under controversial circumstances. He placed second behind Mika H\u00e4kkinen in the first heat, three seconds behind. At the start of the second heat, he overtook H\u00e4kkinen, who only had to finish within three seconds of Schumacher to clinch the overall win. In the closing laps, Schumacher made a mistake, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to attempt to overtake. Michael changed his line immediately before H\u00e4kkinen did the same as the latter moved to overtake, and H\u00e4kkinen crashed into the back of Schumacher's car.[5] While H\u00e4kkinen's race was ended, Schumacher drove to victory without a rear wing.[6] Schumacher gave the prize money from winning the race to his family as they had debts.[7]\n\n\nDuring 1990, along with his Formula Three rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing programme in the World Sportscar Championship. This was unusual for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries competed in Formula 3000 on the way to Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long-distance races would help his career.[3] In the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season, Schumacher won the season finale at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez in a Sauber\u2013Mercedes C11, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship despite only driving in three of the nine races. He continued with the team in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in Japan with a Sauber\u2013Mercedes-Benz C291, leading to a ninth-place finish in the Drivers' Championship. He also competed at Le Mans during that season, finishing fifth in a car shared with Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In 1991, he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1991 430 km of N\u00fcrburgring, Schumacher was involved in an incident with Derek Warwick. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved his Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by Schumacher's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased Schumacher on foot. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from several mechanics and Schumacher's teammate Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.[8]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n### Profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"No one will ever be greater than Schumi. Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nToto Wolff about Schumacher[9]\n\n![](image)Schumacher (left) in 1991\nSchumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race and to push his car to the very limit for sustained periods.[10] He was also noted for his pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him.[11][12] In 2004, *Slate* magazine described Schumacher as \"the ultimate driving machine\" and \"the most dominant athlete in the world\" due to him having become \"quicker, stronger, and fitter than the competition by outworking them in the weight room\".[13] The magazine also stated that Schumacher changed the sport as he set a new benchmark for other drivers and built the team and technologies around him.[13] Schumacher exercised four hours a day, mostly to strengthen his neck muscles to better withstand G-forces during races.[14] After his gym session, he would often head to the race track for testing.[14] In 2003, Deutsche Welle highlighted Schumacher's \"natural talent\" for racing and his \"discipline and leadership\".[14] In 2023, former Formula One rival Giancarlo Fisichella noted that Schumacher \"did not even seem to have sweated\" during races, adding that Schumacher is the greatest Formula One driver of all time and \"rewrote the history of Formula One\".[15]\n\n\nIn 2003, *F1 Racing* magazine analysed Schumacher's driving style using telemetry data.[16] It was noted that Schumacher was \"very sensitively and flexibly\" on the gas and brakes. Compared with his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello, who often either braked or accelerated in a corner, Schumacher usually braked later into a corner and stabilised his car by accelerating slightly, often using both the brake and accelerator pedals at the same time. Exiting a corner, Schumacher accelerated considerably and balanced his car by braking lightly. With his driving style, Schumacher went 25 km/h faster through the hairpin corner of the Suzuka Circuit compared to Barrichello, who lost 0.3 seconds to Schumacher in this corner.[16] It was also noted that when needed, such as when the brakes started to overheat, Schumacher adapted his driving style to protect the brakes.[16]\n\n\n*Motor Sport* author Christopher Hilton observed in 2003 that a \"measure of a driver's capabilities is his performance in wet races, because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed\", and noted that like other great drivers, Schumacher's record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes: up to the end of 2003, Schumacher won 17 of the 30 races in wet conditions he contested.[17] Some of Schumacher's best performances occurred in such conditions, earning him the nicknames \"*Regenk\u00f6nig*\" (rain king)[18] or \"*Regenmeister*\" (rain master),[10] even in the non-German-language media. He is also known as \"the Red Baron\", because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German Manfred von Richthofen, the famous flying ace of the First World War. Schumacher's nicknames also include \"Schumi\",[19] \"Schuey\"[20] and \"Schu\".[21]\n\n\nSchumacher has often been credited with popularising Formula One worldwide, especially in Germany, where it was formerly considered a fringe sport.[7][22] In a 2006 FIA survey, he was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans.[23] Throughout his career, however, Schumacher was subject to anti-German prejudices, especially from the British media.[24] When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers in that year's Drivers' standings were German, more than any other nationality. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers.[25] In 2020, Vettel named Schumacher the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[26]\n\n\nDuring a large part of his Formula One career, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[27] In 2006, Formula One rival David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of the sport, while three-time World Champion Niki Lauda stated: \"He is the greatest. Nobody will ever beat him, as long as we are alive\".[28] In 2020, Schumacher was voted the most influential person in Formula One history.[29]\n\n\n\n### Jordan (1991)[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut.[30]\n\n\nThe week before the race, Schumacher impressed Jordan designer Gary Anderson and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at Silverstone. Schumacher's manager Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit, but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, by cycling around the track on a fold-up bike he brought with him.[31] He impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh. This matched the team's season-best grid position, and Schumacher out-qualified veteran de Cesaris. *Motor Sport* journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying \"clumps of German journalists were talking about 'the best talent since Stefan Bellof'\".[32] Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems.[33]\n\n\n\n### Benetton (1991\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix\nFollowing his Belgian Grand Prix debut, and despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by Benetton-Ford for the next race. Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 1991\u20131993[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished the 1991 season with four points out of six races. His best finish was fifth in his second race, the Italian Grand Prix, in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three-time World Champion Nelson Piquet.[35]\n\n\nAt the start of the 1992 season the Sauber team, planning their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton; Peter Sauber stated that \"[Schumacher] didn't want to drive for us. Why would I have forced him?\".[36] The year was dominated by the Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, featuring powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car's ride height.[37] In the \"conventional\" Benetton B192, Schumacher took his place on the podium for the first time, finishing third in the Mexican Grand Prix. He went on to take his first victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, in a wet race at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, which by 2003 he would call \"far and away my favourite track\".[38] He finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1992 with 53 points, three points behind runner-up Patrese and three in front of the Brazilian Ayrton Senna.[39] According to Jo Ram\u00edrez, a close friend of Senna, the Brazilian considered Schumacher \"the next big threat, way ahead of all the other drivers around at the time\".[24]\n\n\nThe Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost also dominated the 1993 season. Benetton introduced their own active suspension and traction control early in the season, last of the frontrunning teams to do so.[40] Schumacher won one race, the Portuguese Grand Prix where he beat Prost, and had nine podium finishes, but retired in seven of the other 16 races.[41] He finished the season in fourth, with 52 points.[42]\n\n\n\n#### 1994\u20131995: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher drove the Benetton B194 to his first World Championship in 1994.\nFile:Michael Schumacher 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.jpgSchumacher on the podium at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\nSchumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994. The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Senna\u2014witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind Senna\u2014and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.[43][44]\n\n\nSchumacher won six of the first seven races and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race. Schumacher made two pitstops without stalling and finished the race in second place. Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen.[45][46] Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of \"launch control\" that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used.[47]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was penalised for overtaking Hill on the formation lap. He and Benetton then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team.[48] Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed.[49] Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block.[50]\n\n\nThese incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36, Schumacher hit the guardrail on the outside of the track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire.[51] As a result, Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship, the first German to do so\u2014Jochen Rindt was German but raced under the Austrian flag. The race stewards judged it as a racing accident and took no action against either driver but public opinion was divided over the incident and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.[52][53][54] At the FIA conference after the race, Schumacher dedicated his title to Senna.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1995 British Grand Prix\nIn 1995, Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton, which now had the same Renault engine as Williams; according to *Motor Sport* author Marcus Simmons, Benetton had the better team, while Williams had the superior car.[56] Schumacher accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Hill. With teammate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship, breaking the dominance of McLaren and Williams, and became the youngest two-time World Champion in Formula One history.[57] The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the British Grand Prix on lap 45, and again on lap 23 of the Italian Grand Prix. Schumacher won 9 of the 17 races, and finished on the podium 11 times. Only once did he qualify worse than fourth; at the Belgian Grand Prix, he qualified 16th, but nevertheless went on to win the race.[58]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1996\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.[59] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari.[60]\n\n\nFerrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles labels such as \"truck\", \"pig\", and \"accident waiting to happen\".[61] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.[22] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.[62] However, Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship,[63] although afterwards, his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 \"an awful car\", a \"piece of junk\", and \"almost undriveable\", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car \"wasn't very good\".[64] During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.[65]\n\n\nSchumacher, Brawn, Byrne, and Jean Todt, have been credited as turning the struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history.[66][67] Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believed the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.[68]\n\n\n\n#### 1996\u20131999[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It was not a race. It was a demonstration of brilliance.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nStirling Moss about Schumacher at the 1996 Spanish GP[69]\n\nSchumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1996 and helped Ferrari to second place in the Constructors' Championship ahead of his old team Benetton. During the season, the car had reliability problems; Schumacher did not finish in 7 of the 16 races. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher took pole position, but suffered engine failure on the formation lap.[70] He won three races, however, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet.[3] Having taken the lead on lap 19, he consistently lapped five seconds faster than the rest of the field in the difficult conditions.[65] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher used well-timed pit-stops to fend off Williams' Jacques Villeneuve. Schumacher also took first place at Monza to win in front of the tifosi (Ferrari fans).[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher celebrates a second-place finish at the 1997 German Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher battles with David Coulthard at the 1998 British Grand Prix.\nMichael Schumacher and Villeneuve competed for the title in 1997. Villeneuve, driving the superior Williams FW19, led the championship in the early part of the season.[72] By mid-season, however, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix at Jerez with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he might not finish the race.[73] As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival on lap 48, Schumacher turned in on him but retired from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. The race stewards did not initially award any penalty, but two weeks after the race Schumacher was disqualified from the entire 1997 Drivers' Championship after an FIA disciplinary hearing found that his \"manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although deliberate not made with malice or premeditation, it was a serious error.\"[74][75] Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake.[74][76] His actions were widely condemned in British, German, and Italian newspapers.[52][76]\n\n\nIn 1998, Finnish driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen became Schumacher's main title rival. H\u00e4kkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16-point advantage over Schumacher. Schumacher then won in Argentina and, with the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes. One of his victories was at the Hungaroring, a track where overtaking is difficult; Schumacher drove 19 consecutive qualifying-like laps to make Brawn's alternative strategy work and to go from third to first place.[77] Ferrari took a 1\u20132 finish at the French Grand Prix, the first Ferrari 1\u20132 finish since 1990, and the Italian Grand Prix, which tied Schumacher with H\u00e4kkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points. H\u00e4kkinen won the Championship, however, by winning the final two races. There were two controversies during the season; at the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start-finish line and stopped to serve his ten-second stop-go penalty (received for overtaking a lapped car (of Alexander Wurz) during a safety car period). There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but, because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane, the win was valid.[78] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed on the racing line in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. His Ferrari lost a wheel but could return to the pits, although he was forced to retire. Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of \"trying to kill\" him.[79] Coulthard admitted five years later that the accident had been his mistake.[79]\n\n\nIn 1999, Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors' title. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the British Grand Prix at the high-speed Stowe Corner; his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track into the barriers and resulting in a broken leg.[80] During his 98-day absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo. After missing six races, he made his return at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix, qualifying in pole position by almost a second. He then assumed the role of second driver, helping Irvine to victory and assisting his teammate's bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari.[81] Irvine stated: \"He [Schumacher] is not only the best driver in the world, he is also the best number two in the world\".[82] However, in the last race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix, H\u00e4kkinen won his second consecutive title. Schumacher later said that H\u00e4kkinen was the opponent he respected the most.[83]\n\n\n\n#### 2000\u20132004: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher won his fourth World title in 2001.\n![](image)Schumacher driving the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro F2002 at the 2002 French Grand Prix, the race at which he clinched the 2002 Drivers' Championship, setting the record for the fewest races in locking up the title\nSchumacher won his third World Drivers' Championship in 2000, and his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with H\u00e4kkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to close the gap in the standings. H\u00e4kkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix. At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins (41) won by his idol Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[84] The championship fight would come down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to H\u00e4kkinen at the start. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came out ahead of H\u00e4kkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship.[85] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as H\u00e4kkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that \"the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest\" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was \"the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year\". Benson also hailed Schumacher as \"unquestionably the greatest driver of his era\".[86]\n\n\nIn 2001, Schumacher took his fourth Drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the Canadian Grand Prix, where Schumacher finished second to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first-ever 1\u20132 finish by brothers in Formula One;[87] and the Belgian Grand Prix, in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins.[88]\n\n\nIn 2002, Schumacher retained his Drivers' Championship. There was some controversy, however, at the Austrian Grand Prix. His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was leading, but in the final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.[89] Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or technical regulation, it angered fans and it was claimed that the team's actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators. Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be \"given\" wins in only the sixth race of the season, particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step,[89] and for this disturbance, the Ferrari team incurred a US$1 million fine.[90] At the United States Grand Prix later that year, Schumacher returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by the second-closest margin in Formula One history of 0.011 seconds on the finishing line.[91] Schumacher's explanation varied between it being him \"returning the favour\" for Austria, or trying to engineer a formation finish\u2014a feat derided as near-impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second.[92] After the end of the season, the FIA banned \"team orders which interfere with the race result\",[93][94] but the ban was lifted for the 2011 season because the ruling was difficult to enforce.[95] In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion.[96] Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning 11 times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Barrichello. This pair finished nine of the 17 races in the first two places.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Indianapolis in 2004, where he won the 2004 United States Grand Prix\nSchumacher broke Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in 2003, after a closely contested battle with his main rivals. Before the season started, the FIA introduced new regulations and a new points system to make the championship more open.[98] The biggest competition came from the McLaren-Mercedes and Williams-BMW teams. In the first race, Schumacher was run off track, and in the following two, was involved in collisions.[99][100][101] He fell 16 points behind McLaren's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Schumacher won the San Marino Grand Prix\u2014despite the death of his mother Elisabeth just hours before the race[102]\u2014and the next two races and closed within two points of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Aside from Schumacher's victory in Canada and Barrichello's victory in Britain, the mid-season was dominated by Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, who each claimed two victories. After the Hungarian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher led Montoya and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by only one and two points, respectively. Ahead of the next race, the FIA announced changes to the way tyre widths were to be measured: this forced Michelin, supplier to Williams and McLaren among others, to rapidly redesign their tyres before the Italian Grand Prix.[103] Schumacher, running on Bridgestone tyres, won the next two races. After Montoya was penalised in the United States Grand Prix, only Schumacher and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen remained in contention for the title. At the final round, the Japanese Grand Prix, Schumacher needed only one point whilst R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen needed to win. By finishing the race in eighth place, Schumacher took one point and assured his sixth World Drivers' title, ending the season two points ahead of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen.[104]\n\n\nIn 2004, Schumacher won a record 12 of the first 13 races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Montoya during a safety car period. Schumacher clinched a record seventh Drivers' title at the Belgian Grand Prix. He finished the season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up Barrichello, and set a new record of 13 race wins out of a possible 18, surpassing his previous best of 11 wins from the 2002 season.[105]\n\n\n\n#### 2005\u20132006: rule changes and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher battling with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen during the 2005 Canadian Grand Prix\nRule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race,[106] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres.[107] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting.[22] The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault's Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind Alonso.[108] Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher stated: \"I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more. It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon. If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance.\"[109] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix. Before that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap, leaving only six drivers on the grid.[110] Schumacher retired in 6 of the 19 races, and finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso.[111]\n\n\n2006 became the last season of Schumacher's Ferrari career. After three races, Schumacher had just 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races; his pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12-year-old record.[112] Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and started the race at the back of the grid, as he stopped his car and blocked part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to work his way up to fifth place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit. By the Canadian Grand Prix, the ninth race of the season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the following three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After further victories in Italy and China, Schumacher led in the championship standings for the first time during the season.[113] After his win in Italy, Ferrari issued a press release stating that Schumacher would retire from racing at the end of the 2006 season, but would continue working for the team.[114] The tifosi and the Italian press, who did not always take to Schumacher's relatively cold public persona, displayed an affectionate response after he announced his retirement.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher overtakes Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen for fourth with three laps to go of his final race for three years at Interlagos, having dropped to 19th early on.\nSchumacher led the Japanese Grand Prix; with only 16 laps to go, his car suffered an engine failure for the first time since the 2000 French Grand Prix, handing Alonso the victory.[116] During the pre-race ceremonies of the season's last race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, former football player Pel\u00e9 presented a trophy to Schumacher for his achievements in Formula One.[117][118] A fuel pressure problem prevented Schumacher from completing a single lap during the third qualifying session, forcing him to start the race in tenth position.[119] Early in the race, Schumacher moved up to sixth place but suffered a puncture caused by the front wing of Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault.[120] Schumacher fell to 19th place, 70 seconds behind teammate and race leader Felipe Massa. Schumacher recovered and overtook both Fisichella and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to secure fourth place. His performance was classified in the press as \"heroic\",[121] an \"utterly breath-taking drive\",[122] and a \"performance that ... sums up his career\".[123]\n\n![](image)BMW Sauber with \"Thanks Michael\" messages towards Michael Schumacher on the back of their cars. Schumacher and Peter Sauber worked together in sports cars before entering F1 in 1992.\n#### 2007\u20132009: new roles at Ferrari, motorcycle racing and injury[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Finali Mondiali celebrations in the F2007\nDuring the 2007 season, Schumacher acted as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's 'super assistant'.[124] Schumacher also helped Ferrari with their development programme at the Jerez circuit. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 Formula One season.[125] During 2008, Schumacher also competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series. At a Superbike cup race at the Pann\u00f3nia-Ring, Schumacher finished third out of twenty-seven\u2014behind professional motorcycle racers Martin Bauer and Andreas Meklau\u2014riding a Honda CBR1000RR.[126]\n\n\nAt the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Ferrari's Felipe Massa was seriously injured after being struck by a suspension spring during qualifying. Ferrari announced that they planned to draft in Schumacher for the European Grand Prix and subsequent Grands Prix until Massa was able to race again.[127] Schumacher tested a modified Ferrari F2007 to prepare himself as he had been unable to test the 2009 car due to testing restrictions.[128] Ferrari appealed for special permission for Schumacher to test in a 2009 spec car, but Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso were against this test.[129][130] In the end, Schumacher was forced to call off his return due to the severity of the neck injury he had received in a motorcycle accident earlier in the year.[131] Massa's place was instead filled by Luca Badoer and, later, Giancarlo Fisichella.[132]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2010\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"He played a crucial role when we re-joined F1 and was one of the people who laid the foundation for our future success. We're extremely grateful for everything he did for us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nMercedes' team principal Toto Wolff about Schumacher's influence on the Mercedes team[133]\n\nIn December 2009, Schumacher announced his return to Formula One for the 2010 season alongside fellow German driver Nico Rosberg in the new Mercedes GP team.[134] Mercedes returned to the sport as a constructor for the first time since 1955. Schumacher stated that his preparations to replace the injured Massa had initiated a renewed interest in Formula One, which, combined with the opportunity to fulfil a long-held ambition to drive for Mercedes and to be working again with team principal Ross Brawn, led Schumacher to accept the offer once he was passed fit.[134][135] Schumacher signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth \u00a320 million.[134] He turned 41 in 2010 and his prospects with Mercedes were compared with Juan Manuel Fangio, Formula One's oldest champion who was 46 when he won his fifth title.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2010: return from retirement[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished sixth in the first race of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He finished behind teammate Rosberg in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races; former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher might be \"past it\".[136] Several other former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned \"you should never write Schumacher off\".[137] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties.[138] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's car was designed for him, as he would initially drive for the team, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties.[139]\n\n\nMercedes upgraded their car for the Spanish Grand Prix where Schumacher finished fourth. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher finished sixth after passing Ferrari's Fernando Alonso on the final corner before the finish line when the safety car returned to the pits. Mercedes held that \"the combination of the race control messages 'Safety Car in this lap' and 'Track Clear' and the green flags and lights shown by the marshals after safety car line one indicated that the race was not finishing under the safety car and all drivers were free to race.\"[140] However, an FIA investigation found Schumacher guilty of breaching safety car regulations and awarded him a 20-seconds penalty, dropping him to 12th.[141] In Turkey, Schumacher qualified fifth, and finished fourth in the race, both his best results since his return. At the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Schumacher finished 15th, the lowest recorded finish in his career.[142] In Hungary, Barrichello attempted to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare.[143][144] Schumacher was found guilty of dangerous driving and was demoted ten places on the grid for the following race, the Belgian Grand Prix, where he finished seventh despite starting 21st after his grid penalty. At the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Schumacher was involved in a major accident on the first lap, after Vitantonio Liuzzi's car collided with Schumacher's, barely missing his head.[145][146] Schumacher finished the season in ninth place with 72 points. For the first time since 1991, Schumacher finished a year without a win, pole position, podium or fastest lap.[147]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher finished fourth in the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSchumacher's first points of 2011 were scored in Malaysia where he finished ninth; he later came sixth in Spain and took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, after running as high as second in a wet race.[148] Despite starting last in Belgium, Schumacher finished fifth. The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher lead three laps during the race, marking the first time he had led a race since 2006.[149] In doing so, he became the oldest driver to lead a race since Jack Brabham in 1970.[150] Schumacher finished the season in eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with 76 points.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher qualified fastest at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher at the 2012 US Grand Prix\nHe was again partnered by Rosberg at Mercedes for the 2012 season.[152] Schumacher retired from the season's inaugural Australian Grand Prix, and scored a point in the second round in Malaysia.[153] In China, Schumacher started on the front row, but retired due to a loose wheel after a mechanic's error during a pit stop.[154] After causing a collision with Bruno Senna in Spain, Schumacher received a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix. Schumacher was fastest in qualifying in Monaco but started sixth owing to his penalty.[155] He later retired from seventh place in the race.[156] At the European Grand Prix, Schumacher finished third, his only podium finish since his return to Formula One. At 43 years and 173 days, he became the oldest driver to achieve a podium since Jack Brabham's second-place finish at the 1970 British Grand Prix. In Germany, Schumacher set the fastest lap for the 77th time in his career, and in Belgium he became the second driver in history to race in 300 Grands Prix.[157]\n\n\nSchumacher's indecision over his future plans led to him being replaced by Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes for the 2013 season.[158] In October 2012, Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time,[159] stating: \"There were times in the past few months in which I didn't want to deal with Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix.\"[160] He concluded the season with a seventh-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix; Schumacher placed 13th in the 2012 Drivers' Championship.[161]\n\n\n\n## Helmet[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact.[162] The helmet kept the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.[163] Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals. On the top was a blue circle with white astroids.[164] From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello\u2014whose helmet was predominantly white with a blue circle on top and a red ellipsis surrounding the visor\u2014Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red.[165] For the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories.[166] At the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet, which included the year of his debut and the seasons of his seven World Driver's titles.[167] During his 300th Grand Prix appearance, at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher wore a platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.[168]\n\n\n\n* ![Helmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.](image)\n\nHelmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.\n* ![Bell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.](image)\n\nBell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.\n* ![Schuberth helmet for the 2002 season (Ferrari); at the 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix, Schumacher switched his helmet from Bell to Schuberth, though there was a contract with Bell for the 2001 season.

In 1992, the German Motor Sport Federation awarded him the ONS Cup, the highest accolade in German motorsport; he also won the trophy in 1994, 1995 and 2002.[169] In 1993, he won a Bambi Sports Award and was the first racing driver to receive the Golden Steering Wheel.[170][171] In 1994 and from 2001 to 2003, Schumacher was voted European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association.[172] He was voted Polish Press Agency (PAP) European Sportsperson of the Year from 2001 to 2003.[173] In 1995 and from 2000 to 2002, he was named Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year.[174][175] Schumacher was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1995 and 2004.[176] During the latter year, he was voted Germany's greatest sportsperson of the 20th century, beating Birgit Fischer and Steffi Graf to the accolade.[177] For his sports achievements and his commitment to road safety, Schumacher was awarded Germany's highest sporting accolade, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in 1997.[178] In 2002, for his contributions to sport and his contributions in raising awareness of child education, Schumacher was named as one of the UNESCO Champions for Sport.[179]\n\n\nSchumacher won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2002 and 2004,[180] received the Marca Leylenda award in 2001,[181] was named L'\u00c9quipe Champion of Champions three times (from 2001 to 2003),[182] won the Gazzetta World Sports Award twice (2001 and 2002),[183] and won the 2003 Lorenzo Bandini Trophy.[184] In honour of Schumacher's racing career and his efforts to improve road safety and the sport, he was awarded an FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport in 2006.[185] The same year, ahead of his final race for Ferrari at Interlagos on 22 October, football player Pel\u00e9 presented a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" to Schumacher.[186] A year later, in 2007, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport for his sporting prowess and his humanitarian record.[187] Together with Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher won the Race of Champions Nations' Cup six times in a row for Germany, from 2007 to 2012.[188] In 2017, Schumacher was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame and Germany's Sports Hall of Fame.[189][190] In 2020, Jean Todt honoured Schumacher with the FIA President Award, in recognition of Schumacher's seven World Championships and the \"inspiration his sporting and personal commitments brought to the world\".[191]\n\n\nIn Sarajevo, Schumacher was granted honorary citizenship,[192] while the Assembly of the Sarajevo Canton renamed major city transversal street after him,[193] and earlier a large street mural was painted in a city neighborhood of Dobrinja by a group of artists.[194] Honorary citizenship was also granted by Maranello, Modena and Spa.[195][196][197] He was appointed Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur,[198] was honoured with the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic,[199] and was appointed an ambassador of San Marino.[200] In 2008, the Swiss Football Association appointed Schumacher as the country's ambassador for UEFA Euro 2008, hosted by Switzerland and Austria.[201] In recognition of his contribution to Formula One, the N\u00fcrburgring circuit renamed turns 9 and 10 as the \"Schumacher S\", in 2007.[202] In 2014, the first corner of the Bahrain International Circuit was renamed in honour of Schumacher.[203] He received the State Prize of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2022.[204]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1995, Michael married Corinna Betsch.[205] They have two children, a daughter Gina-Maria (born 20 February 1997) and a son, Mick (born 22 March 1999). Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight.[205] From late 1991 until May 1996, Schumacher resided in Monaco. The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump.[206] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland.[207] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers.[208] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007.[1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season.[209]\n\n\nBefore his skiing accident, his main hobbies included horse riding, motorcycle racing, sky diving, and he played football for his local team FC Echichens.[210][211] Schumacher appeared in several charity football games,[212][213] and organised games between Formula One drivers.[214] He is a supporter of 1. FC K\u00f6ln, his local football club from where he grew up, citing Pierre Littbarski and Harald Schumacher as his idols.[215] He is a Roman Catholic.[216]\n\n\nIn 2006, Schumacher had a voice role in the Disney/Pixar film *Cars*. His character is himself as a Ferrari F430 who visits the town of Radiator Springs to get new tires from Luigi and Guido at the recommendation of Lightning McQueen. During arrival, Luigi and Guido both faint in excitement when they see him. The French film *Asterix at the Olympic Games* features Schumacher in a cameo role as a chariot driver called Schumix. In 2009, Schumacher appeared on the BBC's motoring programme *Top Gear* as the Stig.[217] Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, which the BBC subsequently confirmed. Schumacher was there because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the unique black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show.[218] In July 2021, Netflix announced the first officially approved documentary film about Schumacher\u2014called *Schumacher*\u2014which was released on 15 September 2021.[219]\n\n\nSchumacher was a special ambassador to UNESCO and has donated 1.5 million euros to the organisation.[220] Additionally, he paid for the construction of a school for poor children and for area improvements in Dakar, Senegal. He supported a hospital for child victims of the siege in Sarajevo, which specialises in caring for amputees.[221] In Lima, Peru, he funded the \"Palace for the Poor\", a centre for helping homeless street children obtain an education, clothing, food, medical attention, and shelter. Schumacher told *F1 Magazine*: \"It's great if you can use your fame and the power your fame gives you to draw attention to things that really matter\".[222] For the 2002 and 2013 European flood disasters, Schumacher donated 1 million and 500,000 euros, respectively.[223][224] He donated $10 million for aid after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake,[225] which surpassed that of any other sports person, most sports leagues, many worldwide corporations and even some countries.[226] From 2002 to 2006, he donated at least $50 million to various charities.[227] In 2008, he donated between $5M and $10M to the Clinton Foundation.[228]\n\n\nSince his participation in an FIA European road safety campaign, as part of his punishment after the collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix, Schumacher continued to support other campaigns, such as Make Roads Safe, which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the United Nations to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue. In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible drinking. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the world.[229]\n\n\n\n### Finance and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher was an advertising partner for watchmaker Omega. When he won his third title in 2000, which was the first with Ferrari, the *Speedmaster Racing* was issued in a *Schumacher Edition* having his signature on the back.\nIn 1999 and 2000, *Forbes* magazine listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world.[230] In 2005, *EuroBusiness* magazine identified Schumacher as the world's first billionaire athlete.[231] In 2005, *Forbes* ranked him 17th in its \"The World's Most Powerful Celebrities\" list.[232] A significant share of his income came from advertising; Deutsche Verm\u00f6gensberatung paid him $8 million over three years from 1999 for wearing a 10 by 8 centimetre advertisement on his post-race cap.[233] In 2010, his personal fortune was estimated at \u00a3515 million.[234] In 2017, *Forbes* designated Schumacher as the athlete with the fifth highest career earnings of all-time.[235]\n\n\n\n### 2013 skiing accident[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above M\u00e9ribel in the French Alps. While crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit,[236][237] he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet. According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet.[238] He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where he underwent two surgical interventions.[239] Schumacher was put into a medically induced coma because of traumatic brain injury.[240][241] By March 2014, there were small encouraging signs, and in early April he was showing moments of consciousness as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma.[242]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Schumacher left Grenoble Hospital for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland.[243] In September 2014, Schumacher left the hospital and was brought back to his home for further rehabilitation.[244] Two months later, it was reported that Schumacher was \"paralysed and in a wheelchair\"; he \"cannot speak and has memory problems\".[245] In May 2015, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm stated that his condition was slowly improving \"considering the severeness of the injury he had\".[246]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Felix Damm, lawyer for Schumacher, told a German court that his client \"cannot walk\", in response to reports from December 2015 in German publication *Die Bunte* that he could walk again.[247] In July 2019, former Ferrari manager Jean Todt stated that Schumacher was making \"good progress\" but also \"struggles to communicate\". Todt also said that Schumacher was able to watch Formula One races on television at his home.[248] In September of that year, *Le Parisien* reported that Schumacher had been admitted to the H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou in Paris for treatment by cardiovascular surgeon Philippe Menasch\u00e9, described as a \"pioneer in cell surgery\". Following the treatment, which involved him receiving an anti-inflammatory stem cell perfusion, medical staff stated that Schumacher was \"conscious\".[249]\n\n\nSchumacher's family maintains strict privacy about his condition; as of 2023[update] he has not been seen in public since the accident. In April 2023, *Die Aktuelle* published a \"first interview\" with Schumacher with \"quotes\" about his health and family, but it emerged that these responses had been invented by generative artificial intelligence. Schumacher's family said that they would sue the magazine, which sacked the editor responsible.[250][251]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

Vettel is one of the most successful drivers in Formula One history and has won four World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2010 to 2013. Vettel holds the record for being the youngest World Champion in Formula One. He also has the third-most race victories (53) and podium finishes (122), and fourth-most pole positions (57).[4][5][6]\n\n\nVettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off racing appearance in 2007. As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008, where he scored a victory in the Italian Grand Prix to become the then-youngest race winner. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the sport's youngest World Champion. In 2013, he set the then-record for the most consecutive race wins with nine.[7] Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 replacing Fernando Alonso and became Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished both years as runner-up. He parted ways with Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season to race with Aston Martin for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, before retiring from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nVettel was born on 3 July 1987 in Heppenheim, West Germany,[3] to Norbert and Heike Vettel. He has one younger brother, Fabian, a racing driver, and two older sisters: Melanie, a dental technician, and Stefanie, a physiotherapist for disabled children.[9] Vettel suggested in an interview that he was \"terrible\" at school, but he passed his *Abitur* at Heppenheim's Starkenburg-Gymnasium\u00a0[de] with a respectable grade.[10][11] His childhood heroes were \"The three Michaels\": Michael Schumacher, Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He mentioned that he wanted to be a singer like Jackson, but realised that he did not have the voice.[12] Vettel is also a fan of the Beatles, collecting several records, including *Abbey Road* and his favourite song being \"Drive My Car\". In an interview on *Top Gear*, he stated that he is a fan of British comedy such as *Little Britain* and *Monty Python's Life of Brian*. Vettel lives in Thurgovia, Switzerland, amongst other racing drivers and is a fan of German football team Eintracht Frankfurt.[13] Vettel has described himself as competitive, private and impatient. He also appeared in advertisements for Head & Shoulders,[14] and provided the voice of character Sebastian Schnell in the German dub of the 2011 film *Cars 2*,[15] and a voice command assistant in the German and Italian dubs of the 2017 film *Cars 3*.[16]\n\n\nVettel married childhood friend Hanna Prater at a private ceremony in early 2019,[17] and they have three children.[18][19][20] In 2016, *Forbes* estimated that his annual income was $41\u00a0million.[21] Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, his teammate from 2015 to 2018, is a close friend.[22] Besides his native German, Vettel speaks English, French, Finnish and Italian.[23][24] In July 2022, he created his Instagram account,[25] having long eschewed social media.[26] Vettel's first Instagram post was to announce his retirement from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[27]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2023, Vettel announced his involvement with the Germany SailGP Team, as co-owner of the team alongside Thomas Riedel.[28]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nVettel began karting at the age of three, and began racing in karts series in 1995 at the age of eight. He was accepted into the Red Bull Junior Team in 1998,[29] and won various titles, such as the Junior Monaco Kart Cup in 2001. Vettel was promoted to open-wheel cars in 2003, and was given a chance by Derrick Walker to test a Reynard Motorsport Champ Car in a two-day private test at the Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway.[30] A year later, he won the 2004 Formula BMW ADAC championship with 18 victories from 20 races.[31]\n\n\nVettel drove for ASL M\u00fccke Motorsport in the 2005 Formula 3 Euro Series. He was placed fifth in the final standings with 63 points and won the Rookie Cup. He tested for the Williams Formula One team later that year as a reward for his Formula BMW success. Vettel then went on to test for the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[32][33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving at a F3 Euroseries demonstration event in 2006\nVettel was promoted to test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, and participated in the 2006 Formula 3 Euro Series, finishing as runner-up.[34] He also competed in the 2006 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, where he finished first and second at Misano in his first two races. In the next round at Spa-Francorchamps, his finger was almost sliced off by flying debris following an accident, and he was expected to be out for several weeks.[35] Nevertheless, he managed to compete in the 2006 Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort the following weekend, where he finished in sixth place.[36]\n\n\nVettel competed in the 2007 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, and took his first win at the N\u00fcrburgring. He led the championship when he was called up permanently by the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[37]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel on his race debut at the 2007 United States Grand Prix\n### BMW Sauber (2006\u20132007)[edit]\n\n\n#### Test driver and debut[edit]\n\n\nVettel became BMW Sauber's third driver at the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix, when former incumbent Robert Kubica replaced Jacques Villeneuve as second driver for the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.[38] On his testing debut, Vettel set the fastest time in the second Friday free practice.[39] Vettel became the then-youngest Formula One driver to participate in a Grand Prix weekend at 19 years and 53 days.[40] He also set a record for collecting his first fine in nine seconds into his career, as Vettel exceeded the pitlane speed limit on the way to the track.[41] In his second testing session at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions.[42]\n\n\nVettel was confirmed as BMW's test driver for 2007. Following Kubica's crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel was named his replacement at the 2007 United States Grand Prix.[43] He started in seventh position and finished in eighth to become the then-youngest driver to score a point in Formula One.[44]\n\n\n\n### Toro Rosso (2007\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n#### Youngest polesitter and first race win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving for Toro Rosso at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix\nBMW released him in July 2007 to join Red Bull's Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Scott Speed from the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, as Vettel was already under contract to Red Bull Racing.[45] It was also announced that he would drive for Toro Rosso in 2008 alongside S\u00e9bastien Bourdais.[46]\n\n\nIn the rain-affected Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji, Vettel worked his way up to third, behind Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull Racing's Mark Webber, and seemed to be on course for his and the team's maiden podium finish. However, Vettel crashed into Webber under safety car conditions, forcing both cars to retire. Webber said after the race: \"It's kids isn't it. Kids with not enough experience \u2013 you do a good job and then they fuck it all up\".[47] Vettel was initially punished with a ten-place grid penalty for the following race, but this was lifted after a spectator video on YouTube showed the incident may have been caused by Hamilton's behaviour behind the safety car.[48]\n\n\nVettel finished a career-best fourth a week later at the Chinese Grand Prix, having started 17th on the grid while in mixed conditions.[49][50] He was tipped by Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz as one of the sport's big future stars: \"Vettel is one of the young guys with extraordinary potential [...] He is fast, he is intelligent, and he is very interested in the technical side.\"[51]\n\n\nAfter four races of the 2008 season, Vettel was the only driver to have failed to finish a single race, having retired on the first lap in three of them. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Vettel scored his first points of the season with a fifth-place finish, after qualifying 17th. Toro Rosso's technical director Giorgio Ascanelli explained that something changed at the European Grand Prix in Valencia: \"Suddenly Vettel understood something about how to drive an F1 car quickly. It made a huge difference\u00a0\u2013 not only to the speed he could unlock but also to his ability to do so consistently.\"[52]\n\n\nAt the wet Italian Grand Prix, Vettel became the youngest driver in history to win a Formula One Grand Prix, aged 21 years and 74 days.[53] He led for the majority of the Grand Prix and crossed the finish line 12.5 seconds ahead of McLaren's Heikki Kovalainen.[54] It would also be Toro Rosso's only win.[55] Earlier in the weekend, he had already become the youngest pole-sitter.[56] Toro Rosso team boss Gerhard Berger said: \"As he proved today, he can win races, but he's going to win World Championships. He's a cool guy\".[57] His victory led the German media to dub him \"Baby Schumi\".[58]\n\n\nVettel was named 2008 Rookie of the Year at the Autosport Awards.[59]\n\n\n\n### Red Bull (2009\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009\u20132010: Championship runner-up and youngest world champion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel after winning the 2009 Japanese Grand Prix\n![](image)Vettel driving for Red Bull Racing at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix, where he took the first pole position of the season\nAt the start of the 2009 season, Vettel replaced the retired David Coulthard at Red Bull Racing. He began strongly at the Australian Grand Prix, running in second for the majority of the race. However, a clash with Robert Kubica over second place in the latter stages forced both to retire.[60] He went on to take pole position and the race win at Chinese Grand Prix; Red Bull Racing's maiden pole and win.[61]\n\n\nFurther wins followed in Great Britain, Japan and Abu Dhabi.[62] He won the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position, leading every lap.[63] Vettel won the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the first ever day-night race, to finish second in the World Drivers' Championship standings behind Jenson Button.[64] He also scored his third fastest lap of the year, drawing him level with teammate Mark Webber. However, as Vettel had more second fastest laps, he won the 2009 DHL Fastest Lap Award.[65]\n\n\nVettel took the first pole position of the 2010 season at the Bahrain Grand Prix.[66] He led most of the race but as a result of a spark plug failure, Vettel finished in fourth place.[67] At the Australian Grand Prix, Vettel was appointed as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[68] He took his first win of the season in Malaysia.[69]\n\n\nIn Monaco, Vettel made it a Red Bull 1\u20132 with him second and Webber first. Both were equal on points in the standings, with Webber first based on total wins.[70] At the Turkish Grand Prix, Vettel was running second behind Webber when he made a passing move on his teammate. The two collided, putting Vettel out of the race, with neither driver accepting responsibility for the collision.[71]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, both Vettel and Webber's cars were fitted with a new front wing design. Vettel's wing was damaged in the third practice session, and Webber's sole surviving example was removed and given to his teammate.[72] Vettel qualified in first place, but suffered a puncture. He finished seventh while Webber took the victory. In Japan, he qualified on pole ahead of Webber and went on to win with a lights-to-flag victory. Aged 23 years and 98 days, Vettel became the youngest Grand Prix driver to win at the same track on two occasions.[30] At the inaugural Korean Grand Prix, Vettel led the first 45 laps before retiring with engine failure, handing victory to championship rival Fernando Alonso.[73]\n\n\nWith the 1\u20132 finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Vettel and Webber secured Red Bull Racing's first World Constructors' Championship.[74] Vettel went into the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi with a 15-point deficit to Alonso and a 7-point gap to Webber.[75] He won the Grand Prix from pole to become the youngest World Drivers' Champion in the sport's history, as Alonso only finished in seventh place.[76] Following John Surtees in the 1964 season and James Hunt in 1976, this was the third time in Formula One history that the title winner had not topped the championship table until after the last race.[77]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132012: Successful title defences, most poles in a season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel's win at the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix was his first win in the principality, and his fifth from the first six races of the 2011 season.\n![](image)Vettel at the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix where, with four races remaining in the season, he became the youngest double World Drivers' Champion\n![](image)Vettel at the 2012 United States Grand Prix\nVettel started the 2011 season with wins in Australia and Malaysia, before a second-place finish at the Chinese Grand Prix due to poor tyre management, possibly related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio was broken.[78] In Monaco, Vettel led the race but due to another radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not prepared when he came in. The pit stop was slow and he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button. Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps. He was caught by Alonso and Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him.[79] The race was red-flagged with few laps remaining, which allowed teams to change their tyres; when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able to retain the lead and win.[80]\n\n\nAt the European Grand Prix, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) enforced a ban on engine mappings. It was believed by some in the press that this was an attempt by the FIA to thwart Vettel's early domination.[81] Nevertheless, he took pole with the fastest qualifying lap in Valencia Street Circuit's history. Vettel dominated with his first hat-trick of 2011, and won his sixth race out of eight.[82] The FIA implemented another rule change at the British Grand Prix, targeting the blown diffusers. Red Bull believed the changes would cost them about half a second per lap.[83] During the race, Vettel held off Webber for second place, who ignored a radio message from team principal Christian Horner to hold position.[84] It was only the second time in the sport's history that a driver had finished second or higher in each of the first nine races of a season and won at least six of them.[85]\n\n\nVettel's run of fourteen successive front-row starts and eleven successive top two finishes ended at his home race, where he qualified third and finished fourth. In Italy, he took his tenth pole position of the year, in which he joined Ayrton Senna as the only driver to have taken ten pole positions in two separate seasons.[86] A podium finish in Japan secured his second successive title with four races remaining, making him the youngest ever double and back-to-back champion.[87] Vettel won the following race in Korea to become the second driver to take at least ten wins in a season after Michael Schumacher.[88]\u00a0He also helped to secure Red Bull's second successive World Constructors' Championship.[89] Vettel took his eleventh victory of the season in the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, leading every lap from pole position, as well as setting the race's fastest lap to claim his first grand slam.[90] Vettel broke the record for the most pole positions in a season at the season finale in Brazil, after he clinched his 15th pole of the year.[91] He completed the year with 15 poles, 11 victories, and 17 podiums from 19 races; Vettel also earned a record total of 392 points.[92]\n\n\nVettel started the 2012 season with a second place at the Australian Grand Prix, before he finished outside the points in Malaysia following a collision with backmarker Narain Karthikeyan. Vettel and Horner criticised Karthikeyan's driving, with Vettel calling him an \"idiot\",[93] and a \"cucumber\".[94] Karthikeyan hit back, calling Vettel a \"cry baby\".[95] Vettel crossed the line in first place at the Bahrain Grand Prix to go top of the championship standings.[96] Three races without a podium place followed, before he retired at the European Grand Prix after an alternator failure, dropping him to fourth in the standings.[97] In Germany, Vettel finished second behind Alonso but received a 20-second time penalty after the race, as he was off the track when he overtook Button; Vettel dropped back to fifth.[98] He started in 10th place but finished second in Belgium to climb up to second place in the championship.[99] Vettel then retired at the Italian Grand Prix due to an alternator failure, which saw the gap to leader Alonso grow to 39 points with seven races remaining.[100][101] He won next race in Singapore, as he kept the lead until the 2-hour race limit was reached.[102] At the Japanese Grand Prix he took his second career grand slam and coupled with Alonso's retirement, he cut the gap down to just four points.[103] After winning at the Korean Grand Prix, the Indian Grand Prix brought another victory, as Vettel topped all three practice sessions before taking pole position and leading every lap of the race to win.[104]\n\n\nDuring qualifying at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Vettel was told to stop the car due to a fuel pump issue; he was forced to start from the pit lane.[105] From last place, Vettel fought his way back to finish in third place.[106] He started the last race in Brazil with a 13-point cushion against Alonso.[107] On the opening lap, Vettel spun after an incident with Bruno Senna. Following changing weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to finish in sixth place to win the championship by three points and to become the youngest ever triple world champion.[108] He also became the third driver to acquire three consecutive championships, after Juan Manuel Fangio and Schumacher.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132014: Quadruple world champion, nine wins in a row, and departure from Red Bull[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel (left) controversially passing teammate Mark Webber at the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix, despite team orders to maintain position\nVettel started the first two races of the 2013 season on pole position, and at the Malaysian Grand Prix, he lapped over 2.5 seconds faster than teammate Webber in qualifying during a wet session.[110] He won the race, though not without controversy. Vettel ignored the team orders and passed Webber for the lead. Webber was furious after the race and said that Vettel \"will have protection as usual and that's the way it goes\".[111] Team principal Horner, although unhappy with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions. He acknowledged that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident.[112] Vettel claimed that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed Webber despite the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race.[113]\n\n\n\nFollowing wins in Bahrain and Canada, his championship lead was cut at the British Grand Prix as he was denied a likely win due to gearbox failure. Vettel bounced back to win his home race in Germany for the first time. After he finished third in Hungary, Vettel won the last nine races of the season, including grand slams in Singapore and Korea. Vettel set the then-record for most consecutive race wins with nine and he became only the third man after Alberto Ascari and Jim Clark to take consecutive grand slams.[114] He sealed his fourth world title at the Indian Grand Prix.[115]\n\n> \n> *\"It's very difficult for me personally, to receive boos, even though you haven't done anything wrong.\"*\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSebastian Vettel, on being booed on the podium.[116]\n\nOn several occasions during the season, spectators booed Vettel. The booing was widely condemned by fellow drivers, the media and others in the paddock,[117] and Vettel later revealed that it had a negative impact on him.[116]\n\n\nFor the 2014 season and beyond, drivers picked a unique car number to use for the remainder of their Formula One career; Vettel chose the number five. However, as reigning World Drivers' Champion, he carried number one throughout the season.[118] Webber left the sport and was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo, who was promoted from Toro Rosso.\n\n\nVettel struggled with reliability issues throughout winter testing, which forced him to retire at the opening Australian Grand Prix.[119] Reliability problems also forced Vettel to retire at the Monaco and Austrian Grands Prix. Vettel qualified on the front-row for the races in Malaysia, Great Britain and Hungary, and finished on the podium in Malaysia, Canada, Singapore and Japan. After the Russian Grand Prix, he had been outqualified by a teammate over a season for the first time in his Formula One career. In addition to suffering reliability problems, throughout 2014 Vettel struggled to get to grips with the Red Bull RB10,[120] and the Pirelli tyres.[121] He signed off the year by becoming the first defending champion to fail to win a race during a season since Jacques Villeneuve in 1998.[122]\n\n\nIn October, Red Bull had announced that Vettel would be leaving the team at the end of the season to join Scuderia Ferrari, one year before his contract was due to expire.[123] Vettel replaced Alonso and partnered his friend Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen.[124] Vettel mentioned he would like to drive for Ferrari at some point in his career and was already rumoured in 2012 to have a non-binding pre-contract, with options, to join them in 2014.[125] He was denied an early release from his Red Bull contract to test the 2014 Ferrari car in Abu Dhabi.[126] In spite of this, Vettel was present at the Ferrari test \u2013 although not driving the car \u2013 but Red Bull did not enforce any sanctions.[127] Vettel instead made his first appearance in November, completing nearly 100 laps in the 2012 car around the test track of Fiorano.[128]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (2015\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> *The next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true. When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.*\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSebastian Vettel, on his lifelong dream of driving for Ferrari\n\n#### 2015\u20132016: Returning to the top step, a threat to Mercedes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, where he took his maiden win for Ferrari\nVettel made his Ferrari debut by finishing third in the Australian Grand Prix.[129] He followed that up with winning the Malaysian Grand Prix,[130] his first race victory for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost two years. After the race, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with Ferrari made the first win all the more special.[131]\n\n\nHe won the Hungarian Grand Prix to remain a championship contender after he started from third on the grid. He dedicated his victory to the driver Jules Bianchi, who died the week prior from injuries sustained in 2014.[132] At the halfway point of the season, Vettel was 42 points behind championship leader and Mercedes driver Hamilton.[133] Vettel was in third place in Belgium when his right rear blew at high speed on the penultimate lap, likely ending any title chances given Hamilton's win. After the race, he ranted about the 'unacceptable' and 'unsafe' Pirelli tyres that could have caused him serious injury.[134]\n\n\nVettel came home second in the Italian Grand Prix, his first race with Ferrari at the team's home soil.[135] He then took his first pole with the team at the Singapore Grand Prix,[136] Ferrari's first pole for three years. Vettel went on to win the race, and with Hamilton retiring, he closed to within 49 points with seven races remaining.[137] Vettel ended the season in third place, however, with three wins and 13 podiums; he declared the season as a 'miracle'.[138]\n\n\nAfter a third-place finish at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix,[139] Vettel's participation in Bahrain ended without starting as his car broke down on the formation lap.[140] At the Chinese Grand Prix, Vettel collided with teammate R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen on the first lap, but both were able to continue. He blamed Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat for the collision, labelling him a \"madman\" and described his overtaking manoeuvre as \"suicidal\".[141] At the Russian Grand Prix, Vettel retired on the first lap after two consecutive collisions with Kvyat.[142] At the Mexican Grand Prix, Vettel attempted to overtake Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, but after Verstappen ran off the track and rejoined ahead of him, Vettel verbally attacked him and race director Charlie Whiting, for which he later apologised.[143] Vettel then blocked Red Bull's Ricciardo by moving in the braking zone, and was given a ten-second penalty and two points on his licence.[144] Although he achieved seven podium finishes during the season, Vettel did not win any races in 2016.[145]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u20132018: Championship challenges ending in disappointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel during pre-season testing for Ferrari in 2017\nHis third season at Ferrari started with victory in Australia, his first in 18 months.[146] The early form continued the following races, winning in Bahrain and Monaco,[147][148] and finishing second in China, Russia and Spain.[149] In Russia, Vettel took his first pole position in 18 months and with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen alongside him, Ferrari had their first front row lock out since the 2008 French Grand Prix.[150] Vettel's lead at the top of the standings increased to 25 points after the Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari's first victory at the circuit since Schumacher won there in 2001.[148]\n\n\nIn Azerbaijan, Vettel collided into the rear of race leader Hamilton under the safety car, accusing Hamilton of brake testing him.[151] Moments later, Vettel pulled alongside and hit his Mercedes as they prepared for a restart, for which he received a ten-second stop-go penalty.[152] The FIA investigated the Vettel-Hamilton incident further, but Vettel received no punishment. Vettel took full responsibility, issuing a public apology and committing to devote personal time over the next 12 months to educational activities across a variety of FIA championships and events.[153]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix\nVettel's championship lead was cut to only a single point in Great Britain, as he suffered a puncture on the penultimate lap and dropped to seventh place.[154] Vettel started from pole in Hungary and maintained the lead. He overcame steering issues and held on for victory, which gave him a 14-point lead over Hamilton.[155] Mercedes dominated after the summer break and Vettel lost the championship lead at the Italian Grand Prix,[156] which was followed by a first-lap retirement in Singapore after collision with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Verstappen. It was the first time in Formula One history that both Ferraris retired from the first lap of a Grand Prix.[157] His title hopes were dealt another blow in Malaysia, as he started last following a turbo problem in qualifying. He finished in fourth place, but crashed with Williams' Lance Stroll on the cool-down lap; neither would be penalised.[158] More reliability issues befell Ferrari in Japan as Vettel retired due to a spark plug failure.[159] In Mexico, Vettel became the fourth driver in Formula One history to claim 50 pole positions.[160] Verstappen took the lead from Vettel at the start, before Vettel collided with Hamilton, after which Hamilton won his fourth title.[161] For the first time in his career, Vettel failed to win the World Drivers' Championship having led it at some stage during a season.[162]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving past his fans at the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix\nThe 2018 season was dubbed the \"Fight For Five\" by the media, as for the first time in Formula One history, two quadruple world champions lined up at the start of a season.[163] For the second consecutive year, Vettel began the season with victory in Australia, after he took the lead while pitting under the virtual safety car.[164] It was his 100th podium, while he also became only the third man in Formula One history to have led 3,000 laps.[165] In Bahrain, Vettel maintained the lead from pole through the first round of pit stops and held off Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas despite being on old soft tyres to take a fourth victory at the circuit.[166] At the Chinese Grand Prix, he was hit by Verstappen in the latter stages of the race, which caused both to spin. Vettel limped home in eighth place, with his championship lead reduced to nine points.[167] For the first time since 2013, Vettel took three consecutive pole positions as he qualified in first place in Azerbaijan. It was the 23rd different Grand Prix at which he had taken pole position, equalling Hamilton's then-record.[168]\n\n\nAt the Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel won for the third time in 2018 and for the 50th time in his career, becoming only the fourth man to reach a half-century of wins.[169] The following race in France, Vettel lost the championship lead following a collision with Bottas.[170] He bounced back in Great Britain, after he passed Bottas in the last laps to take victory.[171] Vettel led his home race until he slid off the track and hit the wall in the latter stages as rain started to fall, as he had clipped the sausage curb a few laps before, breaking a part of his front wing, causing understeer and loss of downforce;[172][173] he won in Belgium, however, in which he passed Hamilton for the race victory.[174] Contact on the opening lap with Hamilton in Italy saw Vettel damage his front wing and drop to the back of the field, but he recovered to cross the finishing line in fourth place. It left Vettel 30 points behind the Mercedes driver with seven races left.[175] His championship hopes were dealt a further blow as Ferrari's upgrades introduced at the Singapore Grand Prix proved to be unsuccessful, making a step backwards on car development; Ferrari suffered a dip of form until the United States Grand Prix, where they reverted to their old package and successfully rediscovered their form.[176][177] Vettel claimed his first ever podium in Mexico but the World Drivers' Championship went to Hamilton for a second consecutive year.[178] Although Mercedes had been the more consistent and better team,[179] fans and pundits criticised Vettel for making too many mistakes during the season.[180]\n\n\n\n#### 2019\u20132020: Difficult ending at Ferrari[edit]\n\n\nAfter showing impressive pace throughout pre-season testing in Barcelona, Vettel and his new teammate Charles Leclerc headed to Australia with many pundits believing they had the car to beat for the 2019 season.[181] The opening weekend proved to be difficult, however, as Vettel qualified some seven tenths off pole position in third and finished the race in fourth place.[182] Third-place finishes in China and Azerbaijan followed, as Mercedes continued to dominate.[183] Vettel took pole position in Canada; his first pole in 17 races.[184] Midway through the race, a snap of oversteer caused him to run wide onto the grass. Vettel received a five-second time penalty from the stewards, who believed he had returned to the track \"in an unsafe manner and forced [Hamilton] off track\".[185] Vettel crossed the line in first place but lost his victory as a result of the penalty. After the race, he swapped the number one and two signs in front of Hamilton's Mercedes and the empty spot that was supposed for his own car, as Vettel parked his car at the start of the pit entry.[186] At the German Grand Prix, Vettel was unable to qualify after a turbo issue, which meant he would start in last place. During a race with mixed weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to second place.[187]\n\n![](image)Vettel driving the SF90 at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix In Italy, Vettel spun at the Ascari chicane and when he re-entered the track, he made contact with Racing Point's Stroll. Vettel received a 10-second stop-go penalty and finished in 13th place.[188] At the Singapore Grand Prix, Vettel won on a circuit Ferrari were expected to struggle at. For the first time, Vettel had won five times at the same track.[189] The following race, in Russia, Vettel went from third place on the grid to first place in the first corner. However, radio transmissions suggested that the team wanted to swap their drivers, but with Vettel the quicker driver, he remained in front. Vettel retired soon after with a MGU-K problem.[190]\n\n\nVettel took pole position in Japan,[191] but an abrupt start off the line caused him to momentarily stop before getting away, which allowed Bottas to take the lead; Vettel was not penalized for his jump start.[192] After running in third at the Brazilian Grand Prix for the majority of the race, a safety car allowed Red Bull's Alexander Albon and an aggressive Leclerc to overtake him. He tried to pass his teammate immediately but the two Ferraris collided, resulting in another retirement for Vettel.[193] He finished fifth in the World Drivers' Championship, and was outscored by a teammate for only the second time across a season.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel competing for Ferrari on their 1000th Grand Prix\nFerrari later announced they would not extend Vettel's contract beyond the 2020 season. Team principal Mattia Binotto explained there was \"no specific reason\" for the decision, though both parties noted it was an amicable agreement.[195] The season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the first ten races of the original calendar were either rescheduled, postponed or cancelled altogether. Ferrari discovered problems on their car following pre-season testing, forcing them to make a major redesign.[196]\n\n\nThe SF1000 lacked pace as Vettel finished the season's opening race in Austria in 10th place.[197] During the weekend, he was also given a warning for breaching the FIA's COVID-19 protocols after he was seen mixing with members of his former team Red Bull.[198] The following race, at the Styrian Grand Prix, Vettel retired on the opening lap with rear wing damage following a collision with Leclerc.[199] He ended the season in a disappointing 13th place in the Drivers' standings, with a third place in Turkey as his best result.[200] Ferrari only finished sixth in the Constructors' standings, their worst result since 1980, while Vettel's total of 33 points was the lowest in a full campaign in his Formula One career.[201][202]\n\n\n\n### Aston Martin (2021\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2021 British Grand Prix\nVettel joined Aston Martin for the 2021 season, replacing Sergio P\u00e9rez.[203] In his debut race weekend in Bahrain, he received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last. While Vettel started well, he had a collision with Esteban Ocon, giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place. He received five penalty points on his superlicence.[204] Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer reported no concerns, owing to this being a very different car from the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing and a very impressive race start.[205] In the fifth race of the season, Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth-place finish in Monaco.[206] At the following race, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, he claimed Aston Martin's first podium with a second-place finish.[207] Vettel also finished second in Hungary, but was later disqualified, after his car failed to provide the one litre sample of fuel required.[208] He ended the season in 12th place in the Drivers' standings, ahead of teammate Stroll.[209] During the season, Vettel made 132 overtakes\u2014the most of any driver\u2014and won the inaugural Overtake Award.[210]\n\n\nVettel missed the first two races of the 2022 season in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia after testing positive for COVID-19; he was substituted by Aston Martin's reserve driver Nico H\u00fclkenberg.[211][212] In July 2022, Vettel announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[213]\n\n\n\n## Race of Champions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel at the 2007 Race of Champions\nVettel competed in the 2007 Race of Champions at Wembley Stadium, representing the German team alongside Michael Schumacher,[214] winning the Nations' Cup title. He also teamed up with Schumacher from 2008 to 2012, winning the Cup on every occasion.[31]\n\n\nVettel returned to the 2015 Race of Champions, representing Germany together with Nico H\u00fclkenberg.[215] He won his very first individual Race of Champions title that year, beating Tom Kristensen in the final.[216] Vettel and H\u00fclkenberg finished runner-up in the Nations Cup.[31] In 2017, Vettel was eliminated in the first heat for the individual competition,[217] but went on to win the Nations' Cup for Germany by himself with his seventh victory,[218] after his teammate Pascal Wehrlein was injured earlier in a crash.[219]\n\n\nIn the 2019 event, Vettel teamed up with Mick Schumacher, where they finished runners-up in the Nations' Cup to the Nordic team of Kristensen and Johan Kristoffersson.[220] Vettel was eliminated in the group stages of the individual competition,[221] although he won the ROC Skills Challenge.[222] He reached the individual final in 2022 but was beaten by S\u00e9bastien Loeb.[223]\n\n\n\n## Helmet design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2017 helmet design\nFrom his karting days, Vettel worked with helmet designer Jens Munser. At the age of eight, Vettel wanted Sebastian the crab from *The Little Mermaid* on his helmet.[224] Vettel's original helmet in Formula One, like most Red Bull-backed drivers, was heavily influenced by the energy drink company logo. New to Vettel's helmet at the start of 2008 was the incorporation of the red cross shape of the Kreis Bergstra\u00dfe coat of arms on the front, just underneath the visor, in honour of the region of his birthplace, Heppenheim.\n\n\nAfter switching to Red Bull in 2009, Vettel regularly used a variety of new helmet designs. Some designs were small changes to his original Red Bull design, while others were completely new designs, such as the one he used at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix: Vettel had a special white-red helmet design, with black kanji and hiragana for \"gives you wings\". Several of his helmet designs also featured his team members.[225] At the 2012 Italian Grand Prix, Vettel celebrated his 50th helmet design with a 'rusty' matte look and 50 tallies, indicating his 50 helmet designs in Formula One.[226] Vettel started his 2013 campaign with a design in honour of Felix Baumgartner, for his world record Red Bull Stratos space jump in October 2012.[227] By the end of the 2013 season, he had used 76 different helmet designs throughout his career.[228]\n\n\nFor the 2017 Italian Grand Prix he changed the German flag stripe on his helmet to an Italian flag stripe in celebration of Ferrari's home race.[229] Following the death of Niki Lauda, Vettel wore a special helmet based on Lauda's final Ferrari helmet at the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix.[230]\n\n\n\n## Car names[edit]\n\n\nInspired by American bomber pilots in the Second World War, Vettel made it a tradition to name his cars. He said: \"It's important to have a close relationship with a car. Like a ship, a car should be named after a girl as it's sexy\".[231] The car he drove for his first full season in 2008, the Toro Rosso STR3, was named Julie, followed by Kate and Kate's Dirty Sister (2009), Luscious Liz and Randy Mandy (2010), Kinky Kylie (2011), Abbey (2012) and Hungry Heidi (2013). Vettel's car for 2014, the Red Bull RB10, was baptised Suzie. Vettel continued this tradition with Ferrari and christened his 2015 Ferrari SF15-T Eva, followed by Margherita (2016) Gina (2017), Loria (2018), Lina (2019), and Lucilla (2020).[232] In 2021, he named his Aston Martin AMR21 car after Honey Ryder, a character from the James Bond film, *Dr. No*.[233]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Car\n | Name(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **2008** | Toro Rosso STR3 | Julie\n |\n| **2009** | Red Bull RB5 | KateKate's Dirty Sister\n |\n| **2010** | Red Bull RB6 | Luscious LizRandy Mandy\n |\n| **2011** | Red Bull RB7 | Kinky Kylie\n |\n| **2012** | Red Bull RB8 | Abbey\n |\n| **2013** | Red Bull RB9 | Hungry Heidi\n |\n| **2014** | Red Bull RB10 | Suzie\n |\n| **2015** | Ferrari SF15-T | Eva\n |\n| **2016** | Ferrari SF16-H | Margherita\n |\n| **2017** | Ferrari SF70H | Gina\n |\n| **2018** | Ferrari SF71H | Loria\n |\n| **2019** | Ferrari SF90 | Lina\n |\n| **2020** | Ferrari SF1000 | Lucilla\n |\n| **2021** | Aston Martin AMR21 | Honey Ryder |\n\n\n## Comparison to Michael Schumacher[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel and Michael Schumacher after the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix, where Vettel won his second World Championship title\nVettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\".[234]\n\n\nNevertheless, the similarities were marked. Like Schumacher, Vettel grew up in a small town with an everyday background\u2014Schumacher's father is a bricklayer and Vettel's is a carpenter. Both had their first taste of racing at the Kerpen karting track near Cologne, not far from the N\u00fcrburgring. Vettel began driving in his garden lapping the garden many times before he could legally take to the roads, and said his passion for cars was nurtured by watching Schumacher compete.[235]\n\n\nAfter winning his first championship in 2010, and being hailed as the \"Next Schumacher\", Vettel stated he did not want to aim for Schumacher's record after learning how hard it was to get one championship under his belt, though he would like to win more.[236] In 2011, Pirelli director Paul Hembery was impressed when Vettel was the only driver to take the time to visit the factory and talk to the tyre manufacturer to gain a better insight. \"The only other driver that asks us a lot of questions is Michael Schumacher. It is like seeing the master and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at work.\"[237]\n\n\nAfter Schumacher was severely injured in a skiing accident in late 2013, Vettel was on hand to collect the Millennium-Bambi Award for Schumacher's life achievements on his behalf in 2014.[238] In 2014, Vettel cited Schumacher as one of his inspirations in becoming a Scuderia Ferrari driver: \"When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\nVettel has demonstrated an interest in the environment and other social justice issues. Following the 2021 British Grand Prix, he helped remove litter from the stands,[240] and he also worked with children in Austria to build a hotel for bees.[241] A second bee hotel would be erected at the Suzuka International Racing Course ahead of the 2023 Japanese Grand Prix.[242] Furthermore, Vettel has been critical of how F1 races are scheduled, stating that races that are geographically proximate to each other should be held on consecutive weekends to reduce emissions from travelling.[243] He also held an all-women karting event during the weekend of the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix,[244] and wore the pride flag at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix despite being reprimanded.[245] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Vettel expressed an intent to boycott the September's Russian Grand Prix had the race gone ahead as planned.[246]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Vettel appeared on the BBC One political topical debate programme *Question Time* to discuss a variety of issues including climate change, energy dependency, and Brexit.[247] The following month, Vettel appeared on the cover of *Attitude*, voicing support for an LGBTQ driver competing in Formula One.[248] In June 2022, while participating in the Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel denounced Canada's mining of the Alberta oil sands by wearing a T-shirt and helmet patch calling it \"Canada's climate crime\". Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called it \"over-the-top hypocrisy\" because Vettel's team, Aston Martin, is sponsored by petroleum company Saudi Aramco, which he said has \"one of the worst climate-emissions records in the world\".[249] Vettel agreed with the \"hypocritical\" label but said those personal attacks risk missing what he called the \"bigger picture\" of the climate crisis.[250]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nVettel was named Rookie of the Year at the 2008 Autosport Awards. In 2009, Vettel was awarded the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy, for his achievements in the 2008 season. He was also awarded the 2009 British Racing Drivers' Club Johnny Wakefield Trophy for \"setting the fastest race lap of the season on the Silverstone Grand Prix Circuit\".[251] In 2010, Vettel was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year and won the *Autosport* International Racing Driver Award, which he also won in the following three years.[252] In January 2012, Vettel was honoured with the Grands Prix de l'Academie des Sports, and in February, he was further honoured with the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in recognition of his world titles and his \"exemplary character\".[253] Vettel was voted Formula One driver of the year in 2009,[254] 2011[255] and 2013[256] by the team principals, initiated by the *Autosport* magazine. He additionally won the DHL Fastest Lap Award in 2009, 2012 and 2013. He was named European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association in 2010,[257] and by the Polish Press Agency in 2012[258] and 2013.[259] Furthermore, Vettel was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 2013. He was named Sportsman of the Year at the 2014 Laureus World Sports Awards.[260] In 2015, he received the Confartigianato Motori Award for Driver of the Year.[261] After retiring from Formula One in 2022, Vettel received the *Autosport* Gregor Grant Award for his \"achievement in motorsport\".[262]\n\n\nRed Bull Racing sponsor Infiniti released a Sebastian Vettel edition of the Infiniti FX SUV for 2012. It featured increased engine power, revised bodywork and lower suspension than the standard model.[263]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

A four-time Formula One World Drivers' Champion, from 1987 until 2001 he held the record for most Grand Prix victories until Michael Schumacher surpassed Prost's total of 51 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. \n\n\nProst discovered karting at the age of 14 during a family holiday. He progressed through motor sport's junior ranks, winning the French and European Formula Three championships, before joining the McLaren Formula One team in 1980 at the age of 24. He finished in the points on his Formula One debut \u2013 at the San Mart\u00edn Autodrome in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he took his first podium a year later \u2013 and took his first race victory a year later at his home Grand Prix in France, driving for the factory Renault team.\n\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s Prost formed a fierce sporting rivalry, mainly with Ayrton Senna but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. In 1986, at Adelaide in the last race of the season, he beat Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title, after Mansell retired late in the race and Piquet was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a series of controversial clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out. Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After a sabbatical in 1992, he joined the Williams team, prompting Mansell, the reigning Drivers' Champion, to leave for CART. With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship and retired from Formula One driving at the end of the year.[1]\n\n\nIn 1997, Prost took over the French Ligier team, running it as Prost Grand Prix until it went bankrupt in 2002. From 2003 to 2012 he competed in the Andros Trophy, an ice racing championship, taking 38 race victories and winning the championship three times. Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modelling himself on personal heroes like Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark.[2] He was nicknamed \"The Professor\" for his intellectual approach to competition. Though it was not a name he particularly cared for, he would admit later that it was an appropriate summation of his approach to his racing. Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAlain Prost was born in the commune of Lorette near the town of Saint-Chamond, in the d\u00e9partement of Loire close to Saint-\u00c9tienne, France to Andr\u00e9 Prost and Marie-Rose Karatchian, born in France of Armenian descent.[3][4] Prost had one younger brother called Daniel, who died of cancer in September 1986.[5][4] Prost was an active and athletic child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including wrestling, roller skating and football. In doing so he broke his nose several times.[3][4] He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered kart racing at the age of 14 while on a family holiday. This new sport quickly became his career of choice.[3][4]\n\n\nProst won several karting championships in his teens. In 1974, he left school to become a full-time racer, supporting himself by tuning engines and becoming a kart distributor. His prize for winning the 1975 French senior karting championship was a season in French[6] Formula Renault,[7][3] a category in which he won the title and all but one race in 1976.[8]\n\n\nProst went on to win the 1977 Formula Renault European championship before moving up to Formula Three (F3) in 1978. In 1979, he won both the French and European F3 championships, by which time he was on the shopping lists of several Formula One teams.[7] After carefully considering his options, he chose to sign with McLaren for 1980.[3] He surprised the British team by declining their offer of a race drive in a third car at the final race of the 1979 season at Watkins Glen \u2014 reasoning that the token effort would benefit neither him nor the team.[9] Prost felt that it would be a mistake to race in Formula One without being fully prepared: \"..in the end I said, \u2018No' to Marlboro. I asked them to understand that I didn't want to make a mistake; I didn't know Watkins Glen and I didn't know the car. I said I thought it would be a better idea to organise a test.\"[10]\n\n\n\n## Formula One[edit]\n\n\n### McLaren (1980)[edit]\n\n\nProst began his career with McLaren (being run by Teddy Mayer) in 1980 alongside Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he finished in sixth place, earning one point, something achieved by only a handful of drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the previous round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.[9][11][7]\n\n\n\n### Renault (1981\u201383)[edit]\n\n\nProst was partnered with fellow Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux for 1981. Motor sports author Nigel Roebuck reports that there were problems between Prost and Arnoux from the start of the season, Prost being immediately quicker than his more experienced teammate.[12] He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with Andrea de Cesaris in Long Beach and Didier Pironi at Jacarepagu\u00e1, but scored his first podium finish at Buenos Aires. He also did not finish in the next four races, and then won his first Formula One race at his home Grand Prix in France at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.[13][14]\n\n\nFor Prost, his debut victory was memorable mostly for the change it made in his mindset. \"Before, you thought you could do it,\" he said. \"Now you know you can.\"[3] Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first pole position in Germany and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, seven points behind champion Nelson Piquet.[15]\n\n\nProst won the first two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost recovered from losing a wheel,[16] and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified.[17] He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth,[18] but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race.[19] His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that \"When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. I think, to be honest, I had made the mistake of winning! The French don't really like winners.\"[12]\n\n\nIn November 1982, three years before it became a round of the F1 World Championship, Prost, along with fellow F1 drivers Jacques Laffite and Nelson Piquet, made the trip to Melbourne, Australia to drive in the non-championship 1982 Australian Grand Prix at the short (1.609\u00a0km (1.000\u00a0mi)) Calder Park Raceway. Driving a Formula Pacific spec Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford engine, Prost sat on pole for the race with a time of 39.18. He then led every lap to win what would be the first of 3 Australian Grand Prix wins. He finished 15.32 seconds clear of Laffite, with 1981 Australian Grand Prix winner, young Brazilian driver Roberto Moreno finishing third.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost's 1983 Renault RE40, in which he came close to winning his first championship\nArnoux left Renault in 1983 and American Eddie Cheever replaced him as Prost's partner, allegedly because of Renault's desire to sell more road cars in North America (three of the season's 15 races were on the North American continent). Prost earned a further four victories for Renault during the season and finished second in the Drivers' Championship, two points behind Nelson Piquet. Piquet and the Brabham team overhauled Prost and Renault in the last few races of the season. Prost, who felt the team had been too conservative in developing the car, found himself increasingly at odds with Renault's management, who made him the scapegoat for failing to win a championship. In addition to that, the French fans recalled the bitter fight that had caused their favourite, Arnoux, to leave the team. Prost said in an interview with ESPN during the final race that his car was \"not competitive\" and that he \"didn't lose by my own fault\"[21] Renault fired Prost only two days after the South African race. He re-signed for McLaren for the 1984 season within days and moved his family home to Switzerland after Renault factory workers burned the second of 2 of Prost's cars, one of them being a Mercedes-Benz.[12]\n\n\n\n### McLaren (1984\u20131989)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost in 1984\n#### 1984\u20131986[edit]\n\n\nProst joined double world champion Niki Lauda at McLaren (now being run by Ron Dennis) in 1984, driving the John Barnard designed McLaren MP4/2 which used a 1.5 litre TAG-Porsche V6 engine. He lost the world championship to Lauda in the final race of the season in Portugal by half a point, despite winning seven races to Lauda's five,[18] including winning in Portugal.[22] The half point came from the Monaco Grand Prix, where Prost had been leading, albeit with Ayrton Senna (Toleman) and Stefan Bellof (Tyrrell) closing on him rapidly, when Clerk of the Course Jacky Ickx stopped the race at half distance due to heavy rain, which was controversial, for Ickx displayed the red flag without consulting the race officials. Under Formula One regulations, Prost received only half of the nine points normally awarded for a victory.[23] Prost's seven wins in 1984 equalled the record set by Jim Clark in 1963.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost driving the McLaren MP4/2B at the 1985 German Grand Prix\n![](image)Cockpit of Prost's F1 McLaren TAG-Porsche turbo, from his first Championship year\nIn 1985 Prost became the first French Formula One World Champion. He won five of the sixteen Grands Prix during the season. He had also won the San Marino Grand Prix, but was disqualified after his car was found to be 2\u00a0kg underweight in post-race scrutineering.[18][25] Prost finished 20 points ahead of his closest rival, Michele Alboreto.[26] Prost's performance in 1985 earned him the L\u00e9gion d'honneur distinction in France.[8][27]\n\n\nNiki Lauda retired for good at the end of 1985, and was replaced at McLaren by 1982 World Champion Keke Rosberg for 1986. Prost successfully defended his title, despite his car struggling against the Honda-powered Williams cars driven by Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. Until the latter stages of the final race of the 1986 season, the Australian Grand Prix, Prost appeared set to finish second in the Championship, behind Mansell. Prost had the same number of wins as Piquet, but he had four second places to Piquet's three, thus placing him second before the final race. While running third behind Piquet, and directly behind Prost on the road (3rd was all he needed to win the title), Mansell suffered a rear tyre failure at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and crashed out. The Williams team then pitted Piquet to change tyres as a safety precaution, while Prost had already pitted earlier due to a puncture and did not need to change his tyres again. He then held the lead ahead of a charging Piquet to the chequered flag and the Championship.[18] Prost became the first driver to retain the title since Jack Brabham in 1960.[28]\n\n\nAnother memorable race that year for Prost was at the San Marino Grand Prix. He was cruising to victory when his car began to run out of fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race.[29] Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself *\"shit, I am going to lose this race again\"*, referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola.[25] It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd.[30] The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.[31] Prost also finished sixth at the Belgian Grand Prix, where he collided with Gerhard Berger in the Benetton. As a result, the car's front suspension and engine mountings were bent, which badly affected its handling. It would behave one way in left hand corners and a completely different way in right hand corners. McLaren Technical Director John Barnard said afterwards that the car was \"bent like a banana\" upon the teams' post-race inspection of the car.[32]\n\n\n\n#### 1987[edit]\n\n\nWith Rosberg retiring from Formula One at the end of 1986 season, underrated Swede Stefan Johansson filled the McLaren seat alongside Prost for the 1987 season. Even though McLaren had introduced the new Steve Nichols designed MP4/3 after three seasons with the MP4/2 model (Barnard had departed for Ferrari), the TAG engines were not the force they had been previously, lagging behind in power and with unreliability previously unseen. He never gave up though and challenged Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and breaking Jackie Stewart's record for race victories by winning for the 28th time at the Portuguese Grand Prix. \"People might not believe me,\" said Stewart at the time. \"But I'm glad to see Alain take my record. I am glad that he has done it because he's the one that deserves it. There is no doubt in my mind that he is the best race driver of his generation.\"[33][18] Prost considers his win in the opening round in Brazil as his best and most rewarding race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been dominant during qualifying, and Prost started fifth on the grid with a time three seconds slower than Mansell's pole time. Knowing he didn't have the qualifying speed, he instead worked on his race set-up, and with everyone else going for a high-downforce set-up, he went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. With his car having less tyre wear than his rivals, Prost was able to get through the 61 laps of the abrasive Jacarepagu\u00e1 Circuit with only two stops compared to the three or more by his rivals (Piquet pitted for tyres 3 times within the first 40 laps). Prost finished 40 seconds in front of Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.\n\n\n\n\n> When you win a race like this the feeling is very, very good. There have been times when I have been flat-out to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In 1980 I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact the only thing you can judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.[34]\n> \n> \n\n\nProst finished the 1987 season in fourth place in the championship behind Piquet, Mansell and Lotus driver Ayrton Senna. Prost finished 30 points behind champion Nelson Piquet.[35] Other than his debut season in 1980 and 1991, it was the furthest away he would finish a season from the championship lead.[3]\n\n\nDespite a slightly disappointing 1987 season, nevertheless by the end of that year Prost had the honour of notching up his 4th consecutive No.1 driver of the year by the editor of the *Autocourse* annual, matching Niki Lauda's run of No.1's from 1975 to 1978 in the same annual. Writing in 1987, the *Autocourse* editor mentioned that despite driving a down on power engine (compared to the Honda's) \"Prost should have won at least 6 races in 1987 \u2013 but he won't moan about it. Despite being out of championship contention, 1987 was a memorable year for Prost. His win at Estoril was exceptional.\"[36] In 1985, the *Autocourse* editor wrote of Prost: \"In the long run, Ayrton Senna may be the better driver, but in 1985 for speed and consistency Prost had no equal\",[37] while in 1986, the *Autocourse* editor commented on Prost's season \"Alain had an almost faultless year. 1986 was a year of Prost's outstanding all round ability.\"[38]\n\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost driving for McLaren at the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix\nDespite Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Drivers' Championship and Williams winning the Constructors' Championship, Honda decided not to supply the team with their engines, reportedly due to Williams's refusal to dump Nigel Mansell and hire Japanese driver and Honda test driver Satoru Nakajima (who debuted with Lotus in 1987), and instead supplied the McLaren team for 1988.[39] Prost had convinced Ron Dennis to sign Ayrton Senna to a three-year contract,[40] which played a role in luring Honda (Senna's ability had been highly regarded by the Japanese giant when using their engines with Lotus in 1987 and both were keen to continue their association).[41] However, this began the rivalry that pushed two of the sport's greatest drivers to unprecedented heights of success and controversy. McLaren-Honda dominated the season, winning 15 out of 16 races. Prost finished first or second in every race other than his two retirements at Silverstone and Monza. He won seven races and in total outscored his new teammate Senna by 11 points, despite Senna winning one more race than him. However, only the 11 best results from the season counted toward the championship total, and this gave Senna the title by three points.[18] Prost went on to be a proponent of essentially the 1990s scoring system: all points counting toward the final results, with a race winner scoring 10 (rather than 9).[42]\n\n\nIn November of that year, Prost had a meeting with the head of Honda's R&D department and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and \"samurai\"-like driving. Senna had already developed a close relationship with the Honda engineers during the 1987 season when he was at Lotus. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.[43][40]\n\n\n\n#### 1989[edit]\n\n\nMcLaren's domination continued throughout 1989, and the struggle between Prost and Senna for supremacy put them on a collision course. Mutual admiration turned to all-out hatred, with Prost accusing Senna of \"dangerous driving\"[3] and of receiving more than a fair share of attention from both McLaren and Honda. For his part, Senna accused Prost of being in the pocket of FISA's French president Jean-Marie Balestre.[44] The animosity between the two drivers came to a head at Round 2 in San Marino. The drivers made an agreement between them that whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other going into the first turn (in this case, the Tosa bend on the Imola circuit). Prost kept to the agreement after Senna won the first start. Prost however won the restart (caused by Gerhard Berger's fiery crash in his Ferrari), but was passed by Senna under brakes for Tosa. Prost went to a friend of his, a French journalist, and told him about the broken agreement between him and Senna. Against Prost's wishes, the journalist went public with the story. During testing at Pembrey in Wales, Senna denied in public any such agreement had ever existed between Prost and himself, but Prost's claim was backed up by Marlboro's John Hogan who had been present when the agreement was made.[45]\n\n\nProst had the firm belief that Honda and Ron Dennis viewed Senna as the future of the team. Prost recalled that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one car with maybe four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him.[40] Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining Ferrari. Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments. However, Prost received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his 1990 teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not seem to work as well as was once normal. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if there was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. To the delight of the tifosi whose team he signed for the 1990 season, at the rostrum Prost dropped his driver's trophy into the crowd, to the anger of Dennis who since changed McLaren's policy requiring that all trophies won by drivers belong to the team. Dennis was in fact so incensed at Prost that he threw his constructor's trophy at Prost's feet on the rostrum. Prost had a replica trophy made for Dennis but it sat in a cupboard for over 6 years.[46][47]\n\n\nAs 1989 wore on, Prost continually claimed his Honda V10s were not producing the same amount of power as those in Senna's car. It actually got to the point where Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality).[48] Evidence to support Prost's claims was seen during the Mexican Grand Prix. His car was running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came off the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than Senna and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.[49]\n\n\nTheir embittered season ended as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix at the end of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casio Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path resulting in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of Senna's car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban.[50] Thus, Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances, later stating \"Ayrton Senna came behind me, I didn't see him come and I couldn't do anything to avoid him. I am very sorry to have to finish the championship on such an incident\".[51]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1990\u20131991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost practising for his first event for Ferrari, the 1990 United States Grand Prix\nProst signed to join Ferrari in 1990, becoming the first driver signed to the team after the death of team founder Enzo Ferrari in 1988. He replaced Gerhard Berger at Ferrari and was partnered with Britain's Nigel Mansell for 1990 (Berger took Prost's seat at McLaren). As reigning world champion, Prost took over as the team's lead driver and was said to have played on this status. Mansell recalls one incident where at the 1990 British Grand Prix, the car he drove didn't handle the same as in the previous race where he had taken pole position, and later found out from team mechanics that Prost saw Mansell as having a superior car and had them swapped without Mansell knowing.[52][53] Prost won five races for Ferrari that year, in Brazil, Mexico, France, Britain and Spain. Notable among these was the Mexican Grand Prix, where he won after starting in 13th position.[54] In both the Mexican and Spanish races, he led Mansell to Ferrari 1\u20132 finishes. The championship once again came to the penultimate round of the season in Japan with Prost trailing his McLaren adversary, Ayrton Senna, by nine points. As in 1989, a controversial collision between the two settled the race.[18] At the first corner Senna, as admitted a year later, intentionally drove his race car into Prost's, taking them both out of the race and sealing the title in his favour.[44] \"What he did was disgusting,\" Prost said. \"He is a man without value.\"[3] Prost finished the season seven points behind Senna, and his Ferrari team were runners-up to McLaren.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost at the 1991 United States Grand Prix\nMansell left the Scuderia due to his unstable relationship with Prost,[56][53] to rejoin Williams for the 1991 Formula One season. Mansell's replacement was Frenchman Jean Alesi, who had been impressive during the previous two years at Tyrrell. Ferrari had entered a downturn, partially as their famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel efficient V10s of their competitors. The Ferrari chassis, despite a major revision by the French Grand Prix (F-643) was also not up to the level of the McLaren and the Williams models. Prost won no races, only getting onto the podium five times. He took this out on the team, publicly criticising the team and the Ferrari 643,[57] and subsequently had his contract terminated before the end of the season, immediately prior to the Australian Grand Prix.[58] He was replaced by Italian driver Gianni Morbidelli for the final race of the 1991 season and by another Italian, Ivan Capelli, for the following season. Despite being sacked, Prost received a significant payment from Ferrari to not drive for any other team.[59]\n\n\n\n### Williams (1993)[edit]\n\n\nProst went on a sabbatical year in 1992,[3] which was dominated by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team.[59] After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. Prost had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year.[60] Prost was part of a new-look driver line-up at Williams,[61] with test driver Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.[62]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of an F1 car being driven perpendicular to camera](image)\n![Blue Formula One car turning slightly.](image)\nProst driving his 1993 Williams-Renault FW15C at Silverstone (left) and Adelaide (right).\n\nProst won his fourth and final title in a year when he was regularly challenged by teammate Hill and by Ayrton Senna. Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, because the clause in his contract did not extend to 1994 and Senna would be able to join Williams for the upcoming season,[60] and instead opted to retire.[1] At the season's end Prost held the record for most Grand Prix victories,[63][3] a record that stood for almost a decade.[64] On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost was surprised by the gesture, as Senna had declined a handshake at the previous race.[40] Prost's performances earned him an OBE.[65][66]\n\n\nGerman Michael Schumacher broke Prost's record of 51 Grand Prix wins during the 2001 season.[64] He also shares the record for starting every race of a season from the front row (16, in 1993), with Ayrton Senna (1989) and Damon Hill (1996).[67] As of January 2023[update], he is the last Frenchman to have won his home Grand Prix.[68]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost's helmet for the 1988 Formula One season\nProst used a helmet design based on the three colours of the French flag, blue, white and red, with his name along the side. During his early career Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor (blue helmet with a white 180\u00b0 flipped Y and red lines in the lower branch of the flipped Y and in the upper branch, surrounding the top).[69] During Prost's time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet. Prost's helmet changed in 1985, as his helmet now had the blue detail around the front, surrounding the visor (with also a blue stripe on the side region, making the white area become a P) and a white ring with red lines surrounding the top (forming a white circle with a blue half in the rear of the top).[70] Prost kept a similar design for his entry at Ferrari and Williams.\nSometimes Prost used variants of his helmet design. In 2007 he used his original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white helmet with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe on the visor, designed by Kaos Design.[71]\n\n\n\n## Career legacy[edit]\n\n\nProst is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever Formula One drivers, and is considered by some to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[72] In 2009, an *Autosport* survey taken by 217 Formula One drivers saw Prost voted as the fourth greatest Formula One driver of all time.[73] In October 2020, *The Economist* ranked champion drivers by the relative importance of car quality to driver skill. According to this ranking, Prost is Formula One's third best driver of all time.[74] In November 2020, Carteret Analytics used quantitative analysis methods to rank Formula One drivers. According to this ranking, Prost is Formula One's eighth best driver of all time.[75] A 2022 mathematical analysis of all F1 drivers by f1-analysis.com put Prost as the 4th greatest driver of all time, and the second greatest once differences between different eras had been corrected for.[76] In November 2022, *Autosport* ranked Prost as the statistical fourth best driver of all time.[77]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry with Ayrton Senna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prost\u2013Senna rivalry\n\nProst's battles with Ayrton Senna were particularly notable. The rivalry originated in 1988, when Senna joined Prost at the McLaren team. The most notable event during the season between the two occurred during the Portuguese Grand Prix, where Senna tried to block Prost from taking the lead by forcing him to run close to the pit wall at around 280\u00a0km/h (174\u00a0mph). Prost managed to edge Senna outwards, taking the lead as they went into the first corner, but remained angered by Senna's manoeuvre.[78]\n\n\nThe rivalry intensified after the 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, where the two drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner (*cf.* 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in his way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, Prost got away the better of the two but Senna forced his way past him at the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement at the start of the race, leaving Prost furious.[45] Senna argued that it was the restart.[79] Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda,[40] so he announced in mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season. Prost mentioned many times during 1989 that he believed his car was not as competitive as Senna's, and even that this was confirmed to him by the CEO of Honda when Prost traveled to Japan. The information was actually confirmed during the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis said that Prost's car was consistently using more fuel, but not getting more power, than Senna's engine.[80]\n\n\nThe rivalry reached its peak at the end of 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at Suzuka. The two McLarens collided at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away while Senna returned to the track. Senna went on to win the race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, Senna received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading him to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favouring his compatriot Prost.[81]\n\n\nThe following season saw the two drivers collide again. With Senna leading Prost, now in a Ferrari, in the world Drivers' Championship, Prost qualified second for the penultimate race of the season in Suzuka with Senna on pole. Senna was apparently told by a Steward that the pole position would be on one side of the track but discovered before the race that it would be actually be on the other side. Senna complained that no longer being on the racing line, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip (and therefore a slower start) than Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. Senna's appeal was rejected.[82] At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two, but while braking for the first corner Senna did not brake and collided with Prost at 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), clinching the title for himself.[83] Prost almost retired from the sport, saying \"What he did was disgusting. He is a man without value.\"[3] A year later, Senna admitted that the move was premeditated, in retaliation for the collision at the chicane on the same course the previous year.[44]\n\n\nThere was another controversial incident in 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari was unable to put up a challenge regularly to Senna's front running McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very same point.[84] At the following race, in Hungary, the FISA ordered a sit-down meeting between the two men, not wanting any repeats of the incidents from the previous two years.[85]\n\n\nProst took a sabbatical in 1992 after being fired from Ferrari for publicly criticizing the car and the team,[86] and Senna struggled, because McLaren was no longer competitive with Williams. Prost announced his signing with Williams for the upcoming 1993 season. Senna too had wanted to join Williams, as they were the most competitive, but Prost had a clause in his contract excluding Senna as a teammate. An infuriated Senna called the Frenchman a \"coward\" during a press conference at Estoril, and decried his unwillingness to compete for the Drivers' Championship on equal sporting terms:\n\n\n\n\n> I think if Prost wants to be called the sole champion, three-times world champion, come back in a sportive way, maybe win another championship, he should be sportive. The way he's doing, he's behaving like a coward. And if he wants to be sportive, he must be prepared to race anybody, at any condition, at equal terms.[87]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the 1993 season, Prost and Senna continued their on-track rivalry. Prost was escorted by police to the Interlagos circuit for the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix due to the hostility of Brazilians towards him.[88] The two continued their on-track battles at Silverstone where Senna aggressively defended his position against Prost.[89] At Prost's last Grand Prix, the 1993 Australian Grand Prix, he was pulled up by Senna onto the top step of the podium for an embrace.[90][40]\n\n\nOn 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna was killed during the San Marino Grand Prix. Prost was a pallbearer at his funeral.[91] Speaking four years after Senna's death, Prost told Nigel Roebuck that he had \"always refused to speak about him\". Prost stated that when Senna died \"a part of himself had died also\", because their careers had been so bound together.[40] Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he admitted to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only a couple of days before his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: \"A special hello to my...to our dear friend, Alain. We all miss you Alain.\" Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment.[92][40]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nDuring 1994 and 1995, Prost worked as a specialist commentator (pundit) for the French TV channel TF1.[93] He also worked for Renault doing public relations and promotions.[94] Prost went back to his old team McLaren, working as a technical adviser;[3] he also completed L'\u00c9tape du Tour, an annual mass-participation bike ride that takes place on a stage of the Tour de France.[95]\n\n\n\n### Prost Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prost Grand Prix\n\nDuring 1989 Prost began to contemplate starting his own team, as his relationship with his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993.[96] By 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people had assumed that a Prost-Renault team would be formed. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olivier Panis driving for the Prost Grand Prix team at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix\nOn 13 February 1997, Prost bought the Ligier team from Flavio Briatore and renamed it \"Prost Grand Prix\".[97] The day after he bought the team, Prost signed a three-year deal with French car manufacturer Peugeot, who would supply the team with engines from 1998 until 2000.[97] For the team's first season, Prost kept one of Ligier's 1996 drivers, Olivier Panis, who had won the Monaco Grand Prix the previous year; Japanese driver Shinji Nakano was signed to partner Panis. The team raced with the Mugen-Honda engines used by Ligier the previous season, while the car was actually the originally intended Ligier JS45, but was renamed the Prost JS45. Things looked promising at the start of the season, as the team picked up two points on its Grand Prix debut in Australia when Olivier Panis finished fifth. The team scored a further 13 points before Panis broke his leg in an accident during the Canadian Grand Prix. He was replaced by Minardi's Jarno Trulli. From there, things started to go downhill slightly, the team scored only five points during Panis's recovery. He came back at the end of the season to race in the last three Grands Prix. Prost GP finished sixth in the Constructors' Championship in its first season, with 21 points.[98][99]\n\n\nProst became the president of Prost Grand Prix at the start of 1998. With Peugeot supplying the engines for Prost GP, Mugen-Honda decided to supply the Jordan team. Prost GP scored a single point during the season when Jarno Trulli finished sixth in Belgium.[99]\n\n\n1999 was a crucial year for Prost GP.[100] Prost hired John Barnard as a technical consultant,[97] Barnard's B3 Technologies company helping Loic Bigois with the design of the Prost AP02. Panis and Trulli agreed to stay on with the team for the season. The car was not a major concern but the Peugeot V10 engine proved to be heavy and unreliable.[99]\n\n\nPeugeot's final year as Prost's engine supplier in 2000 saw some optimism. Prost hired his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi to drive the lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one: the AP03 proved to be unreliable and ill handling. Things weren't helped when the drivers collided with each other in the Austrian Grand Prix. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.[97]\n\n\nIn 2001 Ferrari agreed to supply engines for the season.[97] The money ran out at the start of the 2002 season and Prost was out of business, leaving debts of around $30 million.[97]\n\n\n\n### Other roles[edit]\n\n\nDuring 2002, Prost spent time with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, finishing third in the *Granite \u2013 Mont Loz\u00e8re*.[101][102] The Frenchman raced in the Andros ice race series in 2003, finishing second in the championship behind Yvan Muller.[103][104] In 2003 and 2004, Prost took part in the \u00c9tape du Tour.[105] Prost also became an Ambassador for Uniroyal, a position he would keep until May 2006.[106][107] Prost continued to compete in the Andros Trophy, winning the title with Toyota in 2006/07, 2007/08[108] and with Dacia in 2011/2012.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\nFor the 2010 Formula One season, the Sporting Regulations were changed so that a former driver sits on the stewards' panel. Prost was the first such driver to take on this role, at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix.[113] Prost also took part in the Race of Champions in 2010, a race organised for legends of motor sport to compete in equal machinery.[114] In February 2012, Prost was named as Renault's new international ambassador, representing the company in sports demonstrations and at events organized or attended by Renault.[115] Prost has finished the Absa Cape Epic, an eight-day 700\u00a0km mountain bike race in South Africa, twice. He first completed the race in 2012 with partner Sebastien di Pasqua and then again in 2013, and started but did not finish the race in 2014.[116]\n\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Prost would join forces with Jean-Paul Driot's DAMS racing team to form e.dams, a team which would compete in the FIA Formula E Championship for electric racing cars from its commencement in September 2014.[117] In June 2014, the team announced that its initial driver line-up would consist of Nicolas Prost and S\u00e9bastien Buemi.[118] The team went on to win the inaugural Formula E teams championship.[119] In 2017, he was employed as a special adviser for the Renault Formula One Team.[120] Since July 2019, he took up a non-executive director role with Renault Sport. During the 1000th Formula One race, the 2019 Chinese Grand Prix, Prost had the honor of waving the chequered flag as Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the line to take his 75th career victory.[121] Prost continued in his role within Renault Formula One Team, renamed \"Alpine F1 Team\" in 2021, until January 2022, when his departure from the team was announced.[122]\n\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\nProst was married to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they divorced sometime later. They have two sons, Nicolas (born 18 August 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990).[123] Prost also has a daughter, Victoria, born in 1996 from his relationship with Bernadette Cottin.[124] From 2014 to 2018, Nicolas raced in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father.[125][126] Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his Renault team fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to Sainte-Croix, Switzerland, and shortly after to Yens, Switzerland. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost's house in France and burned his Mercedes-Benz and another one of his road cars.[8] They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to Nyon in the same country.[127][128] Through Nicolas, Prost has two grandsons named Kimi (born November 2015)[129][130] and Mika (born December 2020).[131] Through Sacha, he has another grandson named Liam\u00a0(born June 2018).[132]\n\n\nIn 1986, Prost was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by the French President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand;[8][27] he was promoted from Chevalier to Officier rank in 1993.[133][134] In addition, he was awarded an honorary British OBE in 1994,[66][65] and the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross in 1999.[135][136] He was also inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and the FIA Hall of Fame in 1999 and 2017 respectively.[137][138]\n\n\nProst speaks fluent French, English and Italian.[139]\n\n\n\n## Karting

Senna is one of three Formula One drivers from Brazil to win the World Championship and won 41 Grands Prix and 65 pole positions, with the latter being the record until 2006. He died in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, driving for the Williams team.\n\n\nSenna began his motorsport career in karting, moved up to open-wheel racing in 1981 and won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship. He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year, and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, the Williams-Renault combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the 1993 season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in 1994.\n\n\nSenna was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap, and from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, is the sixth-most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins and has won more races for McLaren than any other driver. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Alain Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna at the age of 3\nSenna was born at 2:35\u00a0a.m. (05:35 GMT) on Monday, 21 March 1960, in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, a neighbourhood of S\u00e3o Paulo.[2] The middle child of a wealthy Brazilian family, he was born to landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva; he had an older sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo.[3] He was left-handed.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Senna's mother was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, while his father was born to a Spanish mother (from T\u00edjola, Province of Almer\u00eda) and a Brazilian father from S\u00e3o Paulo.[5]\n\n\nThe house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged to Neide's father, Jo\u00e3o Senna. It was located on the corner of Avenida Aviador Guilherme with Avenida Gil Santos Dumont, less than 100 meters from Campo de Marte, a large area where they operated the Aeronautics Material park and an airport. Senna was highly athletic, excelling in gymnastics and other sports, and developed an interest in cars and motor racing at the age of four. However, as a small boy, he had poor motor coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was unremarkable (i.e. showed no abnormalities). Senna's parents nicknamed him \"Beco\".[6][*page\u00a0needed*] At the age of seven, Senna first learned to drive a Jeep around his family's farm and also how to change gears without using a clutch.[7]\n\n\nSenna attended Colegio Rio Branco in the S\u00e3o Paulo neighbourhood of Higien\u00f3polis and graduated in 1977 with a grade 5 in physics along with other grades in mathematics, chemistry, and English. He later enrolled in a college that specialised in business administration, but dropped out after three months.[8] Overall, his grades amounted up to 68%.[6][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna began racing go-karts in Brazil at the age of 13.\nSenna's first kart was built by his father using a small 1-HP lawnmower engine. Senna started racing at Interlagos and entered a karting competition at the age of 13.[9][*timestamp\u00a0needed*] He started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were some years older than him; despite this, he managed to lead most of the race before retiring after colliding with a rival. His father supported his son and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.[10][*timestamp\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nSenna went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. He contested the Karting World Championship each year from 1978 to 1982, finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980.[11] In 1978, he was the teammate of Terry Fullerton, from whom Senna later felt was the rival he got the most satisfaction racing against also because of the lack of money and politics at that level.[12]\n\n\nIn 1981, Senna moved to Eaton[13] near Norwich in England to begin single-seater racing, winning the RAC and Townsend Thoresen Formula Ford 1600 Championships that year with the Van Diemen team.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)21-year-old Senna in his British Formula Ford 1600 single seater\nDespite this, Senna initially did not believe he would continue in motorsport. At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil.[6][*page\u00a0needed*][14] Before leaving England, however, Senna was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for \u00a310,000. Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England. As da Silva is the most common Brazilian surname, he adopted his mother's maiden name, Senna.[15] Senna went on to win the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships.[16] For that season, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.[6][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Senna drove in the British Formula Three Championship for the West Surrey Racing team. He dominated the first half of the season until Martin Brundle, driving a similar car for Eddie Jordan Racing, closed the gap in the second part of the championship. Senna won the title at the final round after a closely fought and, at times, acrimonious battle with the Briton.[17] In November that year, Senna also triumphed at the inaugural Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix with Teddy Yip's Toyota-powered Theodore Racing Team.[18][19][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nSenna was managed for most of his career by Armando Teixeira, who was assisted by Domingo Piedade.[20]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Ayrton Senna\n\n### Toleman (1984)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna's Toleman TG184 from 1984 on display in the Donington Grand Prix Collection\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman. Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg.[21] Neither Williams or McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season.[21] Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) so that he would have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.\n\n\nPeter Warr actually wanted to replace Nigel Mansell with Senna at Lotus, but their British-based title sponsor, Imperial Tobacco (John Player & Sons), wanted a British driver. Senna, however, was determined to drive that season and certainly on his own terms. Senna's test for Brabham occurred at Circuit Paul Ricard in November 1983. Senna impressed the Brabham team and was linked to their second seat. However, the team's main sponsor, Italian dairy company Parmalat, wanted an Italian driver. Brabham's second car was eventually shared by brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi, while Piquet convinced Ecclestone to sign his friend Roberto Moreno as the test driver.[22][23]\nConsequently, Senna joined Toleman, a relatively new team, using less competitive Pirelli tyres.[24][25] Venezuelan Johnny Cecotto, a former Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion, was his teammate.[26]\nIn 1984, Senna hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition due to his concern over his low weight.[9]\n\n\nSenna made his debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro, where he qualified 17th, but retired when the Hart 415T turbocharger failed on lap 8.[27] He scored his first World Championship point when he finished 6th in his second race at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami with severe cramp in his neck and shoulders, and replicated that result two weeks later at the Belgian Grand Prix.[27][28]\n\n\nA combination of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in his failure to qualify for the San Marino Grand Prix, the only time this happened during his career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at Imola due to a dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli (Toleman were in the process of switching from Pirelli to Michelin). Senna then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid.[29] Senna's best result of the season came at the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, he made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing Niki Lauda for second on lap 19. He quickly began to cut the gap to race leader Alain Prost, but before he could attack Prost, the race was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the race was stopped, Senna was catching Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the Tyrrell-Ford of Stefan Bellof was catching both at the same rate, although he was later disqualified due to weight restrictions broken by Tyrrell).[30]\n\n\n\nSenna was renowned throughout his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long before the advent of telemetry; this skill led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the Dallas Grand Prix in the United States as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of Monaco. Symonds recalled in an interview:[31]\n\n\n> The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race, but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish, but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said \"I'm sure that the wall moved!\" And even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him after the race to have a look at the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit, the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened \u2013 we could see it from the tyre marks \u2013 was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.\n> \n> \n\nThat season, Senna took two more podium finishes\u2014third at the British and Portuguese Grands Prix\u2014and placed 9th in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points overall. He did not take part in the Italian Grand Prix after he was suspended by Toleman for being in breach of his contract by entering talks with Lotus for 1985 without informing the Toleman team first. Although Senna did have a \u00a3100,000 buyout clause in his contract, the team had to be informed before discussions with another team started.[32][33] Senna became the first driver Lotus had signed not personally chosen by team founder Colin Chapman, who had died in 1982.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the end of the year, Senna had developed Bell's palsy, possibly from a virus. One side of his face had become completely paralysed; Sid Watkins gave Senna steroids to preserve the possibility of recovery.[34]\n\n\n\n### Lotus (1985\u20131987)[edit]\n\n\n1985\n![](image)Senna driving the Team Lotus 97T at the 1985 European Grand Prix\nSenna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis. He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend. Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes out of inexperience. At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career. He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from Michele Alboreto[35] in the Ferrari and lapping everyone up to and including 3rd placed Patrick Tambay. The race was the first 'Grand Slam' of Senna's career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race. He would later argue it was the best drive of his career,[36] an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised Senna's \"truly special\" talent.[37]\n\n\nSenna led at the San Marino, Monaco, British and German Grands Prix but retired from all these races either from engine failure or running out of fuel, and he had a huge accident at the French Grand Prix at the Circuit Paul Ricard's fastest corner after an engine failure in the middle of the corner. He did not finish in the points again until coming second at the Austrian Grand Prix, despite taking pole three more times in the intervening period. (His determination to take pole at the Monaco Grand Prix had infuriated Alboreto and Niki Lauda; Senna had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately baulking the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge he rejected, though the accusations continued in Canada when drivers accused him of running on the racing line when on his slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time).[38] Two more podiums followed in the Netherlands and Italy, before Senna added his second victory in wet-dry conditions, at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium.[39] Senna's relationship with De Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus and, after spending six years at the team, De Angelis departed for Brabham at the end of the year, convinced that Lotus were becoming focused around the Brazilian driver.[40] Senna and De Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points. In terms of qualifying, however, Senna had begun to establish himself as the quickest in the field: his tally of seven poles that season was far more than that of any of the other drivers (Renault's V6 qualifying engines were reported to be producing over 1,000\u00a0bhp (746\u00a0kW; 1,014\u00a0PS)).[41]\n\n\n\n1986\n![](image)Senna driving the Lotus 98T at the 1986 British Grand Prix\nDe Angelis was replaced at Lotus by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver, which led to the signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted \"It was bad, bad. Until then I had a good relationship with Derek.\"[42] Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races.[43] Although the 98T was like the 97T which came before it, a quick car with superiority on tight, bumpy circuits but plagued with poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season it saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points. The 1986 F1 cars were the most powerful cars in history, with Senna's 98T producing over 1,300\u00a0bhp (969\u00a0kW; 1,318\u00a0PS) in qualifying and 850\u00a0bhp (634\u00a0kW; 862\u00a0PS) in the race.[44]\n\n\nAfter winning the Detroit Grand Prix from Frenchmen Prost and Jacques Laffite\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009which took place one day after Brazil was eliminated from the 1986 FIFA World Cup by France\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009Senna asked a trackside supporter for the Brazilian flag and he drove one lap waving it. Thereafter, he repeated this ritual every time he won a race. During an interview on American television, he used English curse words to express his frustration at having to go into the pits earlier than expected due to a deflating rear tire.[12] Senna also had a brief foray into rallying when he was invited by British magazine *Cars & Car Conversions* to try out a Vauxhall Nova, an MG Metro 6R4, a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and a Ford Escort on a stretch of land closed to the public.[45][46]\n\n\n\n1987\n![](image)The Lotus 99T raced by Senna in 1987\nTeam Lotus had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda. The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment.[47] Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an irate Mansell grabbed Senna by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics.[48][49] Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of his record six victories at the Principality) and the Detroit Grand Prix, his second victory in two years at the angular Michigan street circuit[50] and the first ever for an active suspension F1 car.[51]\n\n\nAs the championship progressed, however, it became evident that the Williams cars had the advantage over the rest of the field, the gap between the Honda-engined teams made most obvious at the British Grand Prix, where Mansell and Piquet in the superior Williams cars lapped the Lotuses of Senna and Nakajima who finished 3rd and 4th respectively. Senna became dissatisfied with his chances at Lotus and at Monza it was announced that he would be joining McLaren for 1988.[52] Senna was fined $15,000 for punching a corner marshal after they refused to push his stalled car in Mexico then finished the season strongly, coming second in the final two races in Japan and Australia, however post-race scrutineering at the final race found the brake ducts of his Lotus to be wider than permitted by the rules and he was disqualified, bringing his last and most successful season with Lotus to a sour end.[53] Senna was classified third in the final standings, with 57 points, six podium finishes and only one pole position. This season marked a turning point in Senna's career as, throughout the year, he built a deep relationship with Honda, which paid big dividends, as McLaren had secured Williams's supply of Honda's V6 turbo engines for 1988.[54]\n\n\n\n### McLaren (1988\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won his first world title in 1988 driving that season's dominant McLaren MP4/4.\nIn 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team.[55] The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years.[56] However, the experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton and Lotus.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Honda RA168E engine, which powered Senna to his first world championship\nOne notable incident of the year was at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Senna out-qualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67.[57] Instead of returning to the pit lane, Senna was so distressed by his mistake that he went back to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. After team manager Jo Ramirez called him through his Monaco apartment's cleaner hours after he had crashed, Senna was still devastated by his own mistake. As the television cameras had not captured his crash, team boss Ron Dennis did not know what had caused his DNF until then, though Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though Senna had clipped the inside barrier at Portier, which pitched him into the outside guard rail. At the Portuguese Grand Prix, Prost made a slightly faster start than Senna, but the Brazilian, as he would a number of times, dived into the fast first corner ahead. Prost responded and went to pass Senna at the end of the first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at 290\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph). Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away. Prost, normally a calm individual, was angered by Senna's manoeuvre, and the Brazilian got away with a warning from the FIA. At the post-race team debrief, Prost voiced his anger at the move which prompted Senna to apologize to Prost for the incident. Ultimately, the pair won 15 of 16 races in the dominant McLaren MP4/4 in 1988 with Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to Prost's seven. Prost scored more points over the season, but three of his second places were dropped, as only the 11 best scores counted, meaning that Senna bested Prost by three points.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alain Prost and victor Ayrton Senna at Grand Prix Molson du Canada at Montreal, Canada, in 1988\nHowever, the biggest incident of the year happened at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, who were closing in on the McLaren (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo chicane, Senna closed on the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for the unwell Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap, and the two collided; Senna's car was beached on top of a curb and had stalled. Ferrari went on to finish 1\u20132, the first in an Italian Grand Prix since the death of the team's founder Enzo Ferrari. This proved to be the only race McLaren did not win in 1988.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring the season, Senna rewrote the record books. His eight wins beat the old record of seven jointly held by Jim Clark (1963) and Prost (1984). His 13 pole positions also beat the record of nine held by Nelson Piquet (1984).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### 1989[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna driving the McLaren MP4/5 in 1989\nThe following year, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it.[59][*page\u00a0needed*] Some controversy also arose after the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis declared that they found consistent differences between the Honda engines from Prost and Senna, to the detriment of Prost.[60] Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the San Marino Grand Prix, a move which Prost claimed violated a pre-race agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, though Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of the team's major sponsor, Marlboro). A discussion between the two drivers and Dennis during a test session at the Pembrey circuit in Wales served to effectively confirm Senna and Prost's personal animosity to Dennis and the team. Senna took an early lead in the championship with victories in San Marino, Monaco, and Mexico. Senna also led every lap of those races, a feat unequalled until Sebastian Vettel replicated it in 2012.[61] Senna also managed to win in Germany, Belgium, and Spain. However, unreliability in four consecutive races in Phoenix, Canada, France and Britain, and further unreliability in Italy, together with collisions in Brazil and Portugal, swung the title in Prost's favour.[62]\n\n\nProst took the 1989 world title after a collision with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the gurney flap from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna.[63] This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners\u2014a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the tight last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini and went on to claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which was not part of the track.[64][65] A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in public criticism of the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made.[66] Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place. Prost, who could not stand working with Senna in what he felt was a hostile environment, left McLaren for rivals Ferrari the following year. Prost had burned bridges even with Ron Dennis after a trophy-related incident in Italy.[67]\n\n\n\n#### 1990[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The McLaren MP4/5B raced by Senna in 1990\nIn 1990, Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second-places, and three thirds. With Prost gone to Ferrari, he also had a new teammate in Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger. Among his victories were the opening round on the wide streets of Phoenix, in which he diced for the lead for several laps with Jean Alesi's Tyrrell before coming out on top, and in Germany, where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. Senna won six races, including another Monaco win, and as the season reached its final quarter, however, Prost in his Ferrari rose to the challenge with five wins, including a crucial victory in Spain where he and teammate Nigel Mansell finished 1\u20132 for the Scuderia. Senna had gone out with a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost was now reduced to nine points with two races left.[68]\n\n\nAs part of Japanese publisher Shueisha's sponsorship of McLaren, Senna collaborated with Akira Toriyama, the creator of *Dragon Ball*, on artwork for *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* featuring McLaren-themed illustrations of *Dragon Ball* characters. Senna was also featured in *GP Boy*, a two-volume manga published in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* to commemorate Shueisha's sponsorship.[69][70]\n\n\nAt the penultimate round of the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack, but after qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton,[71] the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would not have been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) and went off the track, went through the gravel trap and slammed into the tire barrier, making Senna world champion.[72][73]\n\n\nFollowing the second championship-deciding collision in two years, Jackie Stewart interviewed Senna at the subsequent race in Australia (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble forced him to slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved over the last few years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers in the last four years than all the champions before him. An irritated Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions like he did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced and famously said: \"Being a racing driver means you are racing with other people, and if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver.\"[74]\n\n\nA year later, after taking his third world championship, Senna admitted that he had deliberately crashed into Prost at the previous year's Japanese Grand Prix, and he then explained to the press his actions and motives at Suzuka that year. He maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, he had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the track (where the racing line was), only to find this decision reversed after he had taken pole.[75] Senna said that he was not going to accept what he saw as unfair decision-making by the FIA, including his 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990.[76] Senna stated that no matter what happened, he would not yield the corner and that Prost taking his normal racing line would result in an accident. Prost later went on record criticising Senna's actions as \"disgusting\", saying that he seriously considered retiring from the sport after that incident. During an interview with Eurosport at the Australian Grand Prix Prost revealed that he had seen the Honda engine telemetry at Suzuka and that it showed that Senna had kept his foot absolutely flat through the 4th gear corner when he had hit Prost\u200a\u2014\u200aSenna had not even taken his foot off the accelerator to change down to 4th for this corner, strongly intimating that Senna had taken Prost out on purpose.[55]\n\n\n\n#### 1991[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the season-opening United States GP with the new Honda V12-powered MP4/6.\nIn 1991, Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10.[77] Senna won the first four races in Phoenix, Brazil, Imola and Monaco as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge later in the season, having only scored six points by the time Senna had 40 points. Before the Mexican Grand Prix, Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near S\u00e3o Paulo for which he required stitches on the back of his head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier.[78] At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled over on his parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. Senna then had an enormous accident during testing at the very fast Hockenheim circuit in Germany where his car flew 15 feet into the air after a tyre failure, and turned over several times upon coming down onto the track. The car was destroyed and Senna had to spend the night in hospital in nearby Mannheim. While still able to compete in the German Grand Prix at the Hockenheim circuit soon thereafter, at that event Senna ran out of fuel mere laps before the end. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThough Senna's consistency, the car's competitiveness, and the Williams' unreliability at the beginning of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the MP4/6 before it was too late. These modifications, including modifications introduced at Hungary and variable inlet trumpets introduced at Belgium enabled him to make a late-season push, and he won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in Japan when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season.[79] Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty; in addition to Alain Prost's recommendation, Honda had played an important part in bringing Senna with them to McLaren.[80][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nThat year, as had been the case in 1988 and 1990, Senna won the \"International Racing Driver Award\" granted by British magazine *Autosport* annually. The award was presented by Stirling Moss and Senna was interviewed on stage by Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker. During the interview, Senna confirmed that at the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) gala dinner in Paris the day before, under the auspices of Jackie Stewart, Senna had given one of his helmets to his renowned foe, Jean-Marie Balestre, because of the sincere atmosphere that presented itself and as an insulting psychological gesture.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 1992[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix in his McLaren MP4/7A.\nIn 1992, Senna's determination to win manifested itself in dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car.[82] The FW14B, thanks in part to its aerodynamic-enhancing active suspension and powerful Renault V10 engine was much faster than any other car that season. McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new MP4/7A model running (it was McLaren's first car with a semi-automatic gearbox and it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit.[83] During practice for the second race of the season in Mexico on a badly maintained and extremely bumpy circuit Senna and other drivers were heavily critical of, his car hit a bump at one of the circuit's Esses corners that caused a loss of downforce and a hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. Senna had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors while wearing a neck brace; although he raced the next day, he had to retire from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year. During qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, French driver \u00c9rik Comas crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. Senna could hear the stricken car's engine revving at max RPM, and he exited his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman and shut off the car's screaming engine (which could have blown and started a fire at any moment), disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later visited Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from within Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher.[84][85]\n\n\nSenna's relationship with German rising star Michael Schumacher, who was showing exceptional form at every race was never a good one, possibly because Senna saw Schumacher as a threat to his supremacy in F1. At the 1992 Brazilian Grand Prix, Schumacher accused Senna of \"playing around\" while attempting to overtake Senna, who had a problem with his engine--a fact that Schumacher was apparently unaware of at the time. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher collided with Senna, resulting in Senna's retirement. Senna later confronted Schumacher, who admitted responsibility for the accident. At a test session for the German Grand Prix, Senna and Schumacher had a confrontation in the pits, with Senna grabbing Schumacher by the collar and accusing him of endangering him by blocking him on the track.[86]\n\n\nQuestions about Senna's intentions for the upcoming 1993 season lingered throughout 1992, as he did not have a contract with any team by the end of that year. Ferrari had offered him a contract which Senna discussed with Niki Lauda, but decided to decline the offer.[87] He felt the McLaren cars were becoming less competitive than in previous years, especially given Honda's decision to abandon the sport at the end of 1992 due to economic issues and McLaren's lack of active suspension relating to rival Williams.[88]\n\n\nGiven this scenario, Senna secured an IndyCar testing session with the support of compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi. In December 1992, in fact, Senna visited Firebird International Raceway in Chandler, Arizona near Phoenix in the United States[89] to test a 1992 Penske PC-21 CART Indianapolis car.[90] Unlike the more advanced F1 cars, this IndyCar was powered by a turbo Chevrolet-Ilmor V8, had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to its bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula One car; IndyCar teams were run with significantly smaller budgets than F1 teams and did not have to make their own cars. To familiarise himself, Senna initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which he later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 Penske PC-22 at his disposal during this test session.[91] In a 2018 interview, Fittipaldi revealed that Penske boss Roger Penske was ready to enter a third car for Senna to drive at the 1993 Indianapolis 500 - one of the most prestigious and important races in the world and a race that defending champion Mansell was competing at (who had left F1 for CART) - but when McLaren boss Ron Dennis found out it was a very serious deal he promptly banned Senna from competing at Indianapolis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 1993[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the 1993 European Grand Prix in changing conditions, in what many considered one of the best drives of his career.\nFor 1993, attempts were made by McLaren boss Ron Dennis to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines that Williams had found great success with. When these failed, Senna went to Williams himself and sought to take one of their two open rides, as defending champion Nigel Mansell joined the IndyCar Series for 1993 and longtime second driver Riccardo Patrese left to drive at Benetton alongside Michael Schumacher. However, despite Senna going so far as to be willing to forfeit his annual salary just to drive one of Williams' Renaults, this too would fail. Alain Prost was returning to F1 for the first time since the penultimate race of the 1991 season (he had been fired by Ferrari prior to the end of 1991, received a massive severance package as part of a non-compete clause, and took leave for the 1992 season) and filled one of the vacant Williams seats. His contract included a caveat that he had veto power over who he would team with in the other car for 1993; since he still had ill will toward his former McLaren teammate, Prost used that veto to freeze out Senna and force him into what was now a lame-duck season at McLaren.[93] Faced with this, during the post-race press conference of the 1992 Portuguese Grand Prix at the Estoril Circuit, an infuriated Senna called Prost a coward,[94] leading to some commentators stating that what Prost had done was no different from Senna vetoing Derek Warwick from joining Lotus in 1986, but they did not take into account that Senna's chances of winning the championship were much higher in 1993.[95][96]\n\n\nBy this time, McLaren was forced to take a customer supply of Ford V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, Benetton.[97] McLaren hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system \u2013 though the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate Michael Andretti.[98] With this plan, Dennis finally persuaded Senna to stay with McLaren. The Brazilian, however, agreed to do so only for the first race in South Africa, where he would assess whether McLaren's equipment was competitive enough for him to put in a good season. After driving McLaren's 1993 car, the McLaren MP4/8, Senna concluded it had surprising potential, albeit with a Ford V8 engine down on power relative to Prost's Renault V10 and less so on the Benetton's factory V8.[99] Senna thus extended his deal with McLaren on a race-by-race basis instead of a full-year contract, ending up staying for the whole of 1993 in any event.[100] Reportedly, this engagement was on a $1 million per race basis,[101] and, despite midseason testing with a Lamborghini V12 proving encouraging, with McLaren then signing an engine supply deal with Peugeot for the 1994 season, it all proved insufficient to continue to retain Senna past 1993.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna came from the back of the field to finish fourth at the 1993 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in his McLaren MP4/8.\nIn the opening race in South Africa, Senna finished in second place after surviving a collision with Schumacher.[102] Senna won in changing conditions in Brazil and Donington. The latter has often been regarded as one of Senna's greatest victories,[103] in the process setting a record for the fastest lap in an F1 race driving through the then speed-unrestricted pit lane. In cold, wet, rainy conditions typical of England in April he was fifth at the first corner and led the race at the end of the first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for rain or slick tyres.[104][105] Senna then scored a second-place finish in Spain and a record-breaking sixth win at Monaco, breaking Graham Hill's record of five.[106] After Monaco, the sixth race of the season, Senna unexpectedly led the championship from Prost in the Williams-Renault.[107] As the season progressed, Alain Prost and Damon Hill asserted the superiority of their Williams-Renault cars, while Senna suffered mechanical failures in Imola, Canada, Britain, Hungary, and Portugal, where Prost took his 4th world championship, losing apparently none of the skill he was not able to use during his 1992 sabbatical. Senna won the penultimate race of the season in Japan, which was marked by an incident involving Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine, twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the race, Senna angrily stormed into the Jordan team's garage and said to the Irishman \"You're driving like a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot! You're not a racing driver, you're a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot!\u201d before punching him in the side of the head.[108] Following that incident, the stewards gave Senna a two race suspended ban for 1994. However, after a discussion between Senna and the president of the FIA, a compromise was reached by removing the ban, considering the exemplary attitude of Senna towards his fellow drivers.[109] The decision created some polemic back at the time, both amongst drivers and in the press, considering that during the entirety of the 1993 season, Prost was under threat of a four-race ban for using words to criticize the president of the FIA, thus seemingly implying that punching a fellow driver in the face was viewed as a lesser transgression than criticizing the FIA.[110]\n\n\nThe season concluded in Australia, with Senna's 41st and last F1 career win, as well as the last win for an active-suspension F1 car (ironically, Senna had the first victory for a car with this technology in Monaco 1987). The win in Adelaide was an emotional one due to Senna ending his successful career with McLaren and defeating his biggest rival, Prost, for the last time. Because of the Frenchman's imminent retirement from the sport, Senna surprised the F1 community by openly welcoming Prost on the top step of the podium, which many considered a sign of pacification between the duo. Overall, Senna finished the championship second to Prost.[98][111]\n\n\n\n### Williams (1994)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Williams FW16 was the last F1 car raced by Senna.\nFor 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired[112] and was reportedly paid a $20\u00a0million salary.[113] Senna was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost, who would have been assigned number 1 had he returned, retiring. With Senna's arrival, a new sponsor came as well. Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for Williams, with Senna being one of their first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRule changes for 1994 had banned active suspension, traction control, and ABS. During preseason testing, the new Williams FW16 car exhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C and FW14B cars that preceded it, and Senna found himself in close running with the Benetton B194 of Michael Schumacher. Senna expressed his discomfort with the handling of his car, stating, \"I have a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on\u00a0... Some of that is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the car has its own characteristics which I'm not fully confident in yet.\"[114] Senna further added, \"It's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen.\"[115]\n\n\nThe first race of the season was at Interlagos in Brazil, where Senna took pole position. He took an early lead, but Schumacher's Benetton was never far behind. Schumacher took the race lead after passing Senna in the pits. While trying for a win, he pushed too hard and spun the car coming out of Jun\u00e7\u00e3o corner on lap 56, stalling it and retiring from the race.[112] The second race was the inaugural Pacific Grand Prix at Aida, where Senna again placed the car on the pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by second-qualifier Schumacher, he was hit from behind in the first corner by Mika H\u00e4kkinen and his race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini T-boned the Williams. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage. Hill also retired with transmission problems, while Schumacher took the victory again.[116]\n\n\nIt was Senna's worst start to a Formula One season, failing to finish or score points in the first two races, despite taking pole position both times. Schumacher was leading Senna in the Drivers' Championship by 20 points.[117] On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo revealed that, on 27 April 1994, he had held discussions at his home in Bologna with Senna about a future Ferrari engagement.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Season controversies and end[edit]\n\n\nThe 1994 season was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic \"driver aids\" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control. From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled Senna. For example, instead of returning to the pit area after his first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the race to see if he could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used.[119] He returned to the Williams pits after the race, suspicious that the Benetton car was illegal.[120] Indeed, in an interview for the 20th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death, his then-teammate, Damon Hill, revealed that Senna had \"concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine\" with \"special tweak\" giving Benetton an advantage.[121]\n\n\nThe season ended at the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, where the first-corner chicane at the Adelaide Street Circuit was renamed the \"Senna Chicane\". Schumacher went on to win the driver's world championship title controversially after a collision that forced his retirement and that of his rival, and Senna's teammate, Damon Hill. At the official FIA conference after the race, the German dedicated his title to Senna.[122]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Death of Ayrton Senna and 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\n\nThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April and 1 May 1994. The European leg of the F1 season, starting at Imola, was traditionally considered the beginning of the yearly competition. Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title.[123] Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling. During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello was involved in a serious accident when his car became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event. Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness.[124]\n\n\nDuring Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford broke entering the 310\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) Villeneuve corner, sending the car into the concrete retaining wall at high speed. Senna immediately visited the accident scene and medical centre. There he was met by FIA Medical Chief Professor Sid Watkins, who suggested to a tearful Senna that he should retire from racing and take up fishing (a hobby they both shared), to which Senna replied that he could not stop racing.[125] Senna was later called in front of the stewards for commandeering an official car and climbing the medical centre fence, and a row ensued, although Senna was not punished.[126] Senna spent his final morning on Sunday talking to former teammate and rival Alain Prost to discuss the re-establishment of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, a driver's union, with the aim of improving safety in Formula One. Prost had retired from the sport at the end of the 1993 season and was now a media presenter. As the most senior driver in competition, Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting from the next race in Monaco. During the drivers' briefing, concerns had been raised about the mainly promotional use of a Porsche 911 lead car for the warm-up lap, with organizers agreeing to abandon the practice.[126]\n\n\nAt the start of the Grand Prix, Senna retained the lead from his chief rival Michael Schumacher, but proceedings were soon interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. However, the Vectra's lack of speed proved detrimental to the racers, as the slower pace allowed the tyres of the Formula One cars to cool, thus decreasing their pressure. Senna pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, Max Angelelli,[127] to increase his speed.[128] On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace, completing the third-fastest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around 307\u00a0km/h (191\u00a0mph), ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around 233\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of the accident. Within two minutes of crashing, Senna was extracted from his race car by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. The initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss from his temporal artery being ruptured. At this point, Senna had already lost around 4.5 litres of blood, constituting 90% of his blood volume. Because of Senna's grave neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt 18:40 (16:40 GMT), the head of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandri[129] made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17 (12:17 GMT), which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped functioning.[126] Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.[12] The right-front wheel and suspension are believed to have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna on the right side of his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. A piece of upright attached to the wheel had partially penetrated his helmet and made a large indentation in his forehead. In addition, it appeared that a jagged piece of the upright assembly had penetrated the helmet visor just above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery, a major blood vessel supplying the face and scalp. According to Fiandri, any one of these three injuries would likely have killed him.[130][131]\n\n\nIt was later revealed that when the medical staff examined Senna's vehicle, a furled Austrian flag was discovered\u2014he had intended to raise it in honour of Ratzenberger after the race.[132] Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel were taken by Senna's friend and *Autosprint*'s picture editor, Angelo Orsi. Out of respect, those photographs have never been made officially public.[126]\n\n\n\n### Funeral[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAyrton Senna's resting place at the Morumbi cemetery in S\u00e3o Paulo, with an inscription in Portuguese that reads *\"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\"*\n\nSenna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the coffin back to Brazil, but the Senna family wished that it return home in a Brazilian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. The plane was escorted by fighter jets into S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport on 4 May 1994, where it was met by the Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Paulo Maluf, and the state's governor, Luiz Ant\u00f4nio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile (32.2\u00a0km) journey into the city. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.[133]\n\n\nOver half a million people flocked to the streets of Senna's home city of S\u00e3o Paulo to offer him their salute, the largest funeral procession Sao Paulo had ever seen.[134] Over 200,000 people filed past as his body lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in Ibirapuera Park. After the public viewing, a 21-gun salute was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven Brazilian Air Force jets flew in a diamond formation as the funeral procession made its way to Morumbi Cemetery. Many prominent motor-racing figures attended Senna's state funeral, which took place on 5 May, such as team managers Ken Tyrrell, Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart. The pallbearers included drivers: Gerhard Berger, Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost, Thierry Boutsen, Damon Hill, Rubens Barrichello, Roberto Moreno, Derek Warwick, Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin, Hans Stuck, Johnny Herbert, Pedro Lamy, Maurizio Sala, Raul Boesel, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, and Christian Fittipaldi. Neither Sid Watkins nor Jo Ram\u00edrez, the McLaren team coordinator, could bear to attend because they were so grief-stricken. Senna's family did not allow FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's, to attend the ceremony, after an altercation between Ecclestone and Senna's brother Leonardo at Imola regarding Ecclestone's misconstrued reaction to the news of Ayrton's death and the fact that the race had not been abandoned after his accident.[135] FIA President Max Mosley instead attended the funeral of Ratzenberger on 7 May, in Salzburg, Austria.[136] Mosley said in a press conference 10 years later, \"I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his.\"[137] Senna's grave bears the epitaph \"Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus\", which means \"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\" (a reference to Romans 8:38\u201339).[138]\n\n\nA testament to the adulation he inspired among fans worldwide was the scene at the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where McLaren-Honda cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received, they overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby.[139] This was despite the fact Senna no longer drove for a Honda-powered team. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda[140][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] and was beloved in Japan, where he achieved a near-mythic status.[141] For the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger.[142]\n\n\n\n### Italian prosecution[edit]\n\n\nItalian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended forthwith. Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter. The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.[143] This prosecution culminated with verdict no. 15050 handed down by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on 13 April 2007, which stated: \"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control\". Head, however, was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.[144]\n\n\nThe criminal charges focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed, causing the accident, and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was no time to manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.[145]\n\n\n\n## Motorsport career outside Formula One[edit]\n\n\nSenna did not participate in many other forms of motorsport once he reached Formula One.\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the saloon exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new N\u00fcrburgring in 1984.He took part in the 1984 N\u00fcrburgring Race of Champions, an exhibition race where all drivers competed in identical examples of the then-new Mercedes 190E 2.3\u201316 with minor race modifications. The race was held on the then newly-opened N\u00fcrburgring GP Track, before the European Grand Prix. Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula 1 drivers, including Stirling Moss and past World Champions Jack Brabham, Denny Hulme and Alan Jones, driving identical touring cars. Alain Prost started from pole position, but Senna took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning the race ahead of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann.[146] After the race, Senna was quoted as saying, \"Now I know I can do it.\"[147] Senna was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race, taking over from Emerson Fittipaldi.\n\n\nIn 1984 he also took part in the N\u00fcrburgring round of the 1984 World Sportscar Championship, driving a Porsche 956 for New-Man Joest Racing, alongside Henri Pescarolo and Stefan Johansson.[20] He finished in 8th place but impressed the team and his co-drivers.\n\n\nHe took part in the Masters Karting Paris Bercy event in 1993, an indoor karting competition held on a temporary circuit at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. This event is notable for being the stage for the last on-track duel between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna at home in his native Brazil\nSenna was a devout Catholic once saying: \"Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune. It doesn't mean that I'm immortal\".[148] He often read the Bible on long flights from S\u00e3o Paulo to Europe.[149][150] According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: \"On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.\"[148]\n\n\nAs his profile rose, Senna expressed concern over the poor in Brazil. After his death, he was discovered to have secretly donated millions of dollars to help poor children.[151] Shortly before his death, he created the framework for an organisation dedicated to Brazilian children, which later became the Instituto Ayrton Senna (IAS).[152]\n\n\nSenna was awarded the No. 1 driver of the year by the editor of the Autocourse annual 3 times, in 1988, 1991, and 1993, as well as taking the runner-up spot in 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1992. However, Senna was so outraged by the editor dropping him from No. 1 to No. 2 in the 1990 listings as a result of Senna's first corner crash at Suzuka in 1990 with Alain Prost\u2014a piece of driving the editor considered completely reckless\u2014that despite being given the No. 1 driver award in 1991, Senna refused to write the usually customary foreword by the year's World Champion; Honda's Head of Racing wrote the foreword instead. The Autocourse editor wrote in 1993 that Senna had \"intense egocentricity and uniquely flawed genius\" and \"matchless genius in the wet\".[153] In the 2000 edition of Autocourse celebrating 50 years of Formula 1, the editor acknowledged that \"Senna was the one driver who genuinely cared where he was ranked in the Top 10 drivers by the AUTOCOURSE editorial\" and that Senna took being placed below his rivals as a personal slight.[154]\n\n\nSenna was often quoted as using driving as a means for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life, saying, \"The harder I push, the more I find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations, and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation.\"[155]\n\n\nTowards the end of his career, Senna became increasingly preoccupied with the dangers of his profession. On the morning of his death, he initiated the reformation of the GPDA safety organisation, with which he had intended to work to improve the safety of his sport.[156]\n\n\nSenna owned several properties, including an organic farm in Tatu\u00ed, Brazil (where he built a go-kart track in 1991), a beach house in Angra dos Reis, Brazil, an apartment in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, an apartment in Monaco, an estate in Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera, and a house in Algarve, Portugal.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSenna's own \"BAe-125\" private jet (top) in Faro, Portugal with registration N125AS, AS standing for his initials, and passing time with a model plane (bottom)\n\nSenna enjoyed a range of physical activities including running, waterskiing, jet skiing, and paddleboarding. He also had several hobbies, such as flying real and model planes and helicopters,[158] boating, fishing, and riding his favourite Ducati motorbikes. His private jet was a British Aerospace 125, and he also piloted his own helicopter between his residences in Brazil along with travelling to races.[159] For his 29th birthday in 1989, the Brazilian Air Force gave Senna a flight on one of their jet fighters (a Dassault Mirage III), which bears commemorative livery and is now exhibited at the Aerospace Museum of Rio de Janeiro.[160] After a 3 ship flyover of the type at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix, Senna was given a joyride in an RAAF F-111C[161]\n\n\nSenna was close friends with McLaren teammate Gerhard Berger, and the two were always playing practical jokes on each other.[162] Berger is quoted as saying, \"He taught me a lot about our sport, I taught him to laugh.\"[163] In the documentary film *The Right to Win*, made in 2004 as a tribute to Senna, Frank Williams notably recalls that as good a driver as Senna was, ultimately \"he was an even greater man outside of the car than he was in it.\"\n\n\nIn 1992, Senna received a fine and a temporary driving ban in the UK after driving a Porsche at speeds up to 121\u00a0mph (194.7\u00a0km/h) on the M25 near London.[164]\n\n\nSenna was married to Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza from 1981 until 1982. Vasconcelos, whom he had known since childhood, had difficulty adapting to her husband's racing life in England. Vasconcelos later said: \"I was his second passion. His first passion was racing... There was nothing more important in the world for him, not family, not wife, nothing.\"[165] Though he did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father out of a sense of pride.[166] The marriage ended in divorce. Senna then courted Adriane Yamin, daughter of an entrepreneur from S\u00e3o Paulo, who was 15 years old when they began the relationship in 1985 and often chaperoned by her mother during meetings with Senna. They were briefly engaged, but the relationship was broken off by Senna in late 1988.[167] Senna dated Brazilian TV star Xuxa from late 1988 until 1990. He then dated Christine Ferracciu, who lived with him at his homes in Monaco and Portugal, on and off between 1990 and 1991.[167] Senna also had an affair with American model Carol Alt,[168] and briefly dated models Marjorie Andrade and Elle Macpherson.[167][169] At the time of his death, Senna was in a relationship with Brazilian model, and later TV personality, Adriane Galisteu.[170]\n\n\nOne of the most extravagant claims involving Senna's past partners was made by Edilaine de Barros, a former model better known as Marcella Praddo. She alleged that the couple dated from 1992 to 1994. Barros' child, Victoria, was born weeks after Senna's death, and claims that Senna was the father were soon made but abandoned following their rejection by the Senna family. Years later, after joining a religious sect, the former model was convinced to sue against the estate of Senna. In 2000, DNA tests of hair and saliva samples given by Senna's parents conclusively proved that he was not the father of de Barros' child.[171]\n\n\nIn his early years in Formula One, Senna was the subject of a smear campaign orchestrated by Nelson Piquet, ranging from Senna being regarded as a taxi driver to being homosexual given his failed marriage.[172] According to a 1990 interview by Brazilian edition of *Playboy*, Senna declared that he lost his virginity at 13 years of age to a prostitute arranged by his cousin, and he also insinuated that he had a relationship with Piquet's would-be wife (hence Piquet's acrimony).[172]\n\n\nFormer Formula One driver Bruno Senna is the nephew of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: \"If you think I'm fast, just wait until you see my nephew Bruno.\"[173] Due to the death of his uncle, Bruno initially gave up motor racing at his family's insistence.[174] He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.[175]\n\n\n\n## Non-racing commercial activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of Senna's NSXs on display at the Goodwood Festival of Speed\nIn the late 1980s, to take advantage of the relationship Honda had formed with Senna, the Japanese company asked him to help fine-tune the Honda NSX's suspension setting during its final development stages. Test runs were conducted at various circuits, including five sessions with prototypes at the Suzuka Circuit where chief NSX engineer Shigeru Uehara and his team were present to gather Senna's direct input.[176] Senna found the prototype NSX initially lacked chassis stiffness to the level to which he was accustomed, so the final production version was further reinforced to his satisfaction.[177]\n\n\nSenna reportedly had access to three of these cars: a black 1993 NSX in Brazil, which he ordered to his specifications, bearing license plate BSS-8888, which represents his initials for \"Beco\" \u2013 his childhood nickname \u2013 \"Senna da Silva\" and 8 to commemorate his first F1 championship in 1988; a red one with licence plate SX-25-59, which was loaned to him by Honda Portugal; a black one purchased by Antonio Carlos de Almeida Braga, who was a close personal friend, manager, and mentor of Ayrton Senna.[178]\nSenna also appeared in different commercials for the 4th generation Honda Prelude.\n\n\nSenna was also instrumental in bringing Audi cars into his native country, both as an import and manufacturing business. Audi entered Brazil in 1994 via Senna's company, Senna Import, founded in 1993. Sales began in April that year, just a month before his untimely death. In 1999, Audi Senna was created as a joint venture of Audi with Senna Import.[179] Aside from the black NSX mentioned above, Senna's other personal car in 1994 was a silver Audi 100 S4 Avant.[180][181]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Senna developed his own merchandise brand represented by a logo with a double S, after his full surname, \"Senna da Silva\".[182] This logo is meant to represent an S chicane on a racing circuit. The Senna brand was used for apparel, watches, bicycles (Carraro), motorcycles and boats. Hublot,[183] TAG Heuer,[184] and Universal Gen\u00e8ve[185] have created limited-edition watches to honour Senna, both during his lifetime and after his death.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Ayrton Senna at the Parco delle Acque Minerali by the Tamburello corner of the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Italy\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long and excessively detailed.** Please consider summarizing the material. *(April 2023)*\n |\n\n\nMany safety improvements were made in the sport following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths and Barrichello's crash. These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner and other parts of the Imola circuit were altered for 1995. This was despite calls for action in 1989, after a serious high-speed crash in which Senna's friend, Gerhard Berger, suffered burns to his hand. No action took place after that crash because, following an inspection by Senna and Berger, they ended up siding with officials who had, for years, claimed that the wall could not be moved further back due to a river nearby.[186] Revised on-track medical procedures also saw personnel hold up curtains at crash sites, to prevent the public from viewing distressing images as had occurred on live television with Senna.\n\n\nIn July 1994, the Brazil national football team dedicated their World Cup victory to Senna, and collectively held a banner on the field after defeating Italy in the final.[187][188] Senna had met various members of the squad, including Ronaldo[189] and Leonardo, three months earlier in Paris, telling them \"this is our year\".[190][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Throughout the rest of the 1994 season, Senna was commemorated in various ways. Damon Hill, along with Michael Schumacher, dedicated their individual success to Senna with Hill's victory in the Spanish Grand Prix and Schumacher's world-championship victory in the Australian Grand Prix.[191][192]\n\n\nA few months before his death, Senna had discussed with his sister the foundation of a charitable organization, based on a desire to contribute to those less fortunate in a more organised and effective manner. After his death, Viviane Senna set up the Instituto Ayrton Senna in his honour, which has invested nearly US$80\u00a0million over the last 12 years in social programs and actions in partnership with schools, government, NGOs, and the private sector, aimed at offering children and teenagers from low-income backgrounds the skills and opportunities they need to develop their full potential as persons, citizens, and future professionals.[193] The foundation is officially advised by Bernie Ecclestone, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger. The Senninha (\"Little Senna\") cartoon character, born in 1993/94, was another means by which Senna extended his role-model status in favour of Brazilian children.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senninha\n![](image)A monument dedicated to Senna's Formula 1 racing, located at the entrance of the tunnel under Ibirapuera Park in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nIn his home country of Brazil, the main freeway from the international airport to S\u00e3o Paulo and a tunnel along the route to the heart of the city are named in his honour. Also, one of the most important freeways of Rio de Janeiro is named after Senna (\"Avenida Ayrton Senna\"). The main road in Senna's Portuguese resort at Quinta do Lago, Algarve, was also dedicated to him, because his villa there was very near (but not on) this road. A portion of the Interlagos Circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo is named the \"Senna Esse Chicane\" in his honour and decorated with commissioned art from beloved Brazilian artist Luciana Bermelho. In the English town of Reading, Berkshire, where Senna lived for a short period of time, a street in the suburb of Tilehurst was named after him.[195]\n\n\nIn April 2000, Senna was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.[196] That year, the UK public also voted Senna's opening lap of the 1993 European Grand Prix, the 43rd in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[197]\n\n\nIn 2004, a book called *Ayrton: The Hero Revealed* (original title: *Ayrton: O Her\u00f3i Revelado*[198]) was published in Brazil for the 10th anniversary of his death. Senna remains a national hero in Brazil and his grave attracts more visitors than the graves of John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley combined.[149]\n\n\nIn addition, to mark the 10th anniversary of Senna's death, on 21 April 2004, over 10,000 people attended a charity match in a football stadium near Imola. The game was organised by several devoted Italian and Canadian fans of Senna, bringing the Brazil team that won the 1994 World Cup to face the \"Nazionale Piloti\", an exhibition team composed exclusively of top race car drivers. Senna had been a part of the latter in 1985. Michael Schumacher, Jarno Trulli, Rubens Barrichello, Fernando Alonso, and many others faced the likes of Dunga, Careca, Taffarel, and several of the team that won the FIFA World Cup in the United States 10 years earlier. The match finished 5\u20135 and the money was donated to the IAS. Viviane Senna, the president of the IAS, was also involved in the kick-off of this match. That same weekend, Bernie Ecclestone revealed that he still believed Senna was and remained the best F1 driver he had ever seen.[135]\n\n\nSince his death, Senna has been the subject of several songs (either wholly dedicated to him or simply referring to him) including by: Italian singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla (song titled \"Ayrton\"[199]), Italian rock band The Rock Alchemist, whose 2012 song \"Live or Die\" and their 2018 video for \"Live Or Die\" are inspired by the life and character of Ayrton Senna, Jazz pianist Kim Pensyl; Japanese jazz-fusion guitarist and T-square bandleader Masahiro Andoh (references in songs such as \"Faces\" and subsequent revisions, like \"The Face\"); Chris Rea (on his song \"Saudade\"); Spanish band Delorean (2009 extended play entitled *Ayrton Senna*); British acid jazz band Corduroy (1994 song \"Ayrton Senna\").\n\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, to pay tribute to Senna, the Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati produced three special \"Senna\" editions of their 916 superbike. Ducati was at the time owned by Claudio Castiglioni, a personal friend of Senna who was an avid Ducati owner and endorsed the release of this 916 in March 1994. In 2002, under the presidency of Castiglioni, MV Agusta also released the special-edition F4 750 Senna motorbike followed by the F4 Senna 1000 in 2006. In both instances, each edition was limited to 300 units and, just like with the Ducati, all profits from sales were donated to the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[200] In 2013, Ducati also released a special edition of their new top-of-the-range sportbike, the 1199 Panigale S Senna.[201] In 2014, the IAS commissioned a commemorative Vespa that was auctioned for charity. It was custom-painted in the colours of Ayrton Senna's helmet by Alan Mosca, the son of Senna's helmet design creator, Sid, based on more than 50 \"T5 Pole Position\" models of the PX125 scooter that Ayrton won as part of the award to Formula 1 polesitters introduced by Piaggio in 1985.[202]\n\n\nSince 1995, the first season after Senna's tragic death, every Williams F1 car displayed a small 'S' logo on its nose to honour their former driver and in support of the IAS.[203][204] A revised logo was featured in 2014 for the 20th anniversary of the driver's death.[203] In February 2022, however, the 'S' logo was removed from the livery of the Williams FW44, the team's first car to have been developed wholly under new owners, Dorilton Capital.[204] When asked about this decision, team principal Jost Capito stated that the team wanted to \"move on in the future\" and stop reminding its drivers of Senna's fatal accident, while also revealing plans to open a new space fully dedicated to the Brazilian driver in Williams' own museum, instead.[204] Capito admitted that Senna's family did not get involved in the decision to remove the logo, but said that efforts to tighten the team's ties with the Instituto Ayrton Senna were under way.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Senna Chicane\" at the Adelaide Street Circuit, South Australia\n![](image)Ayrton Senna's statue in Wa\u0142brzych, Poland\nThe organisers of the former Formula One Grand Prix street circuit in Adelaide, South Australia, renamed the first chicane the \"Senna Chicane\" in his honour in 1994, and also a road in the Adelaide suburb of Wingfield is named \"Senna Road\".[205] A shortened version of the Adelaide circuit (which remains the site of Senna's last Formula One win) and the chicane remain in use for local motorsport events, and a commemorative concrete plaque installed in 1995, bearing Senna's signature and hand prints, is also located there.[206] The Adelaide circuit was said to be a favourite of Senna's, and he was reportedly unhappy about the upcoming shift of venue from Adelaide to Melbourne in 1996.[207] Other motorsports circuits have similarly named sections of their track after Senna, such as the Circuito de Jerez in Spain, Hockenheimring in Germany, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Canada, the Snetterton Circuit in the UK, the Circuito do Estoril in Portugal, and the Aut\u00f3dromo Juan y Oscar G\u00e1lvez in Argentina.\n\n\nHe has been voted the best driver of all time in various motorsport polls, including *F1 Racing* magazine's 2004 poll, and German newspaper *Bild am Sonntag*'s poll of current drivers in 2010.[208] In 2009, a poll of 217 current and former Formula One drivers conducted by *Autosport* magazine named Senna as \"the greatest Formula One driver who ever lived\".[209][210] In 2012, *BBC Sport* journalists voted Senna as the greatest Formula One driver of all time, after naming their top 20 greatest drivers in a countdown on their website.[211] In 1993, a poll of F1 drivers gave Senna a near-unanimous vote as the best driver in F1.[212]\n\n\nThe Japanese public ranked Senna 22nd in a 2006 survey of their favourite persons in history.[213] The results were part of *The Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan* program broadcast by Nippon TV on 7 May that year.[214]\n\n\nIn 2007, Prince Albert of Monaco unveiled a plaque in honour of Senna in a ceremony that was attended by Vivane Senna. An exhibition also took place that showcased Senna's victories around Monaco, along with his helmets that were borrowed from Senna's family and a selection of McLaren cars raced by Senna that were brought over from Motegi.[215]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2010, on the day that would have marked Senna's 50th birthday, the football team Corinthians, which Senna supported, played a tape in memory of Senna which was also part of the theme played at the S\u00e3o Paulo Motor Show.[216]\n\n\nOn 25 July 2010, the BBC motoring show, *Top Gear* paid tribute to Senna with British Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton driving Senna's original MP4/4, with which he won the 1988 title. This was prior to the release of the BAFTA Award winning documentary named after him, *Senna*, directed by Asif Kapadia. In this documentary broadcast only once by the BBC, Senna is named the number one driver ever, by fellow racing drivers. A StudioCanal, Working Title Films, and Midfield Films documentary production, *Senna* was released to critical acclaim.[217]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Honda released a video of an audio-visual tribute on the Suzuka circuit in the dark, titled \"Sound of Honda \u2013 Ayrton Senna 1989\". Using the telemetry and sound of the Honda-powered McLaren MP4/5 driven by the Brazilian driver, Honda recreated the then lap record lap of 1:38.041 minutes by positioning speakers and lights along the 5.8\u00a0km track and activating them in synchronization with the race car's position during that lap.[218] In May of that year, Honda also reconfirmed its return to the sport as McLaren's engine supplier from 2015, with both companies again leveraging on Senna's legend as part of their advertising campaign since.[219][220]\n\n\nOn 25 October 2013, a holiday PlayStation 3 bundle with Gran Turismo 6 was announced which is dedicated to his memory, with some of the proceeds of this bundle going to help the IAS.[221] This was not the first time that Senna was immortalized in a video game since, in 1992, Sega developed and published *Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II* for the Sega Mega Drive, Master System and Game Gear. Apart from featuring advice from Senna himself, the tracks included Senna's own farm circuit in Tatu\u00ed, S\u00e3o Paulo and it was based on the 1991 F1 World Championship (albeit with fictitious rival drivers and teams due to licensing restrictions). This was then followed by the Japan-exclusive *Ayrton Senna Personal Talk: Message for the Future* for the Sega Saturn, which was a multimedia compact disc containing interviews with Senna overlaid with still images.\n\n\nIn March 2014, during the Brazilian Carnival celebrations, the samba group Unidos da Tijuca paid tribute to Senna in one of their parades in Rio de Janeiro. The group showcased his McLaren car along with other characters associated with speed, such as Sonic, The Flash, and Usain Bolt. The school won the coveted trophy for the best parade of 2014.[222]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2014, Google had a special Doodle to honour Senna's 54th birthday that day.[223]\n\n\nIn occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, on 29 April 2014, in partnership with the IAS, the Brazilian regional airline Azul Linhas Aereas paid tribute by baptizing its Embraer ERJ-195 (registration no. PR-AYU (cn 19000434)) with a new name and livery. The airplane, which was formerly called \"Azultec\", has been renamed \"#sennasempre\" (\"Senna forever\") and features the IAS logo on the rear side of the fuselage and the graphics of Senna's F1 helmet at the front, making it appear as though it is wearing the iconic helmet.[224][225]\n\n\nTributes were also made at the Imola circuit to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death.[226][227] On 1 May 2014, thousands of fans from around the world gathered at the Tamburello corner, at the exact scene where Senna suffered his fatal crash 20 years earlier, to hold a minute's silence. Various current and former F1 drivers were in attendance, including: Ferrari drivers Fernando Alonso and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen; Ferrari Driver Academy member Jules Bianchi; Senna's close friend and McLaren teammate, Gerhard Berger; and the Italians Jarno Trulli, Ivan Capelli, Pierluigi Martini, Andrea de Cesaris, and Emanuele Pirro.[228] Flowers and other cherishable items were also placed around the statue of Senna, situated directly adjacent to the Tamburello corner.[229]\n\n\nIn May and July 2014, the Republic of San Marino issued 70,008 commemorative EUR 2,50 stamps[230][231] as well as 8,000 silver proof coins in Eur 5,00 denomination.[231] In December 2014, a French company also produced 520 commemorative coins designed by a Brazilian artist.[232] The American firm Rosland Capital collaborated with the Ayrton Senna Institute to produce a commemorative coin collection in 2017.[233]\n\n\nIn November 2014 British artist Ian Berry unveiled a portrait of Ayrton in S\u00e3o Paulo at the Institut Ayrton Senna to the press and the family of Ayrton Senna. The artist famed for his artwork using only jeans presented the piece, that also included the jeans of the Senna family to great acclaim.[234][235] The piece traveled around the world for many fans to see and commemorated the 20th anniversary of his passing.\n\n\nIn 2015, when Lewis Hamilton matched Ayrton's three titles, the Senna family gave him an edition of the Ian Berry portrait made out of the family's jeans, Viviane Senna presented it to him at the S\u00e3o Paulo GP.[236]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2017, after qualifying on pole for the Canadian Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton was presented with a Senna helmet that had been worn by Senna during a race. It was given by Senna's family in recognition of Hamilton's 65th pole position, matching Senna's tally.[237]\n\n\nMcLaren unveiled the McLaren Senna, a 789\u00a0bhp track-focused sports car named after Senna, on 9 December 2017.[238]\n\n\nOn 1 October 2018, Nike and Corinthians partnered with the Ayrton Senna Institute to unveil a never-before-seen collection inspired by the Lotus team's colour scheme and honouring Ayrton Senna, including the team's new third kit. The collection #LuteAt\u00e9SerEterno [fight until you're eternal] was intended as a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the driver's first world title, which he won at Suzuka, in Japan.[239] A half-Austrian, half-Brazilian flag was presented on the top step of the podium by the race winner of the 2019 Spanish Grand Prix in honour of Ratzenberger and Senna.[240]\n\n\nA DLC for Codemasters' *F1 2019* depicting Senna's rivalry with Alain Prost was released in June of the same year: it featured digitalized depictions of the two drivers, along with car liveries inspired by their helmet designs.[241]\n\n\nOn 8 May 2019, a sculpture of Senna by British artist Paul Oz was unveiled in Barcelona to mark the 25th anniversary of the driver's tragic death.[242]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2021, a bronze life-size statue of Ayrton Senna was unveiled in Walbrzych (Poland), standing in a street named after him.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMinor planet 6543 Senna is named in his honor.[243]\n\n\nIn 2020, Netflix announced development on a fictionalized miniseries about Ayrton Senna. Gabriel Leone is set to star, with a predicted release date of 2024.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Helmet design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna's helmet bearing the colours of the Brazilian national flag\nIn his karting days, Senna's helmet consisted of a plain white background with notable features absent. He experimented with several designs to satisfy him, such as a white, yellow, and green helmet,[244] before settling on a design by Sid Mosca that included a yellow background with a green stripe surrounding the upper visor and a light metallic blue stripe surrounding the lower visor (both stripes are delineated in the other stripe's color) that was first seen in 1979; Mosca also painted helmets for Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.\n\n\nAccording to Mosca, the blue and green stripes symbolised movement and aggression, while the overall yellow colour symbolised youth;[9] the three colors were also identifiable with the Flag of Brazil. The helmet never had significant changes, apart from sponsorship. One such change was that Senna occasionally altered the stripe from blue to black. The tone of yellow changed a number of times, while usually a rich sunburst yellow, in 1985 and 1986 in some races, he used a fluorescent neon yellow colour. In 1994, the helmet was a lighter, paler yellow to complement the blue and white of the Williams car. He used a number of helmet brands throughout his career. From 1977 to 1989, he used Bell (Star \u2013 '77 to '82, XFM-1 \u2013 '83 to '89), from 1990 to 1991 Honda's own Rheos brand, 1992 to 1993 he used Shoei (X-4) and for 1994 he returned to using Bell (M3 Kevlar).[245] The helmet worn by Senna in the fatal race was returned to Bell in 2002 and was incinerated while family members watched.[246]\n\n\n\n### Third-party adaptations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bruno Senna's helmet design is an adaptation of his uncle's (seen here parading the 1985 Lotus 97T at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix).\nHis nephew Bruno wore a modified version of his helmet design (a yellow helmet with a green and blue stripe) during his Formula One career, but the stripes are shaped after an S rather than being straight, under the chin area it has a green stripe, and it has a blue rounded rectangle in the top area. Bruno sported a modified helmet design for the final three races of the 2011 season to honour the 20th anniversary of Ayrton winning his last world championship.[247]\n\n\nAt the 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello incorporated part of Senna's helmet design into his own.[248] For the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, another variant of Senna's helmet was used by Lewis Hamilton and by Barrichello too. Hamilton used the design with permission from Senna's sister Viviane and the helmet was later sold in support of the IAS.[249] At the 2015 Brazilian Grand Prix, Hamilton again varied his helmet design (this time, the rear only given FIA restrictions on design changes in force from 2015) accompanied with a Twitter announcement stating \"Just for you, Brazil!! A tribute to the greatest\".[250]\n\n\nOutside of motor racing, Brazilian cyclist Murilo Fischer wore a helmet based on Senna's helmet colour scheme of yellow with green and blue stripes on stage 11 of the 2015 Giro d'Italia, which finished on the Imola circuit.[251]\n\n\nFor the 2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, Pierre Gasly wore a special helmet with Senna's colours and the *Senna Sempre* (Senna Forever) badging on top.\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Series\n | Team\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1977\n

In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among others.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season\u2014to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\n\n\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles.\n\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of *Time* as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Hamilton, Lewis' father and then-manager, celebrating with his son after the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix[6]\nHamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.[2] His father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and from Birmingham,[7] making him mixed-race;[8] Hamilton has identified as black.[9] Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.[10] Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.[11][12] Hamilton was raised a Catholic.[13]\n\n\nHamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five.[14] Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition.[15] Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse.[14][16] Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school.[17] To support his son, Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents,[18] while still attending his son's races.[19] Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company.[20] He continued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.[21][22]\n\n\nHamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage.[23] Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school.[24] He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries.[25] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young.[20] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[26] In February 2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[27]\n\n\n\n## Junior racing career[edit]\n\n\n### Karting[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.[28][29] Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\"[18] Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\"[30] When Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25.[31] In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins,[15] to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren driver development programme.[8] The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.[28]\n\n\n\n> \n> He's a quality driver, very strong and only 16. If he keeps this up I'm sure he will reach F1. It's something special to see a kid of his age out on the circuit. He's clearly got the right racing mentality.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Michael Schumacher, speaking about Hamilton in 2001[32]\n\nHamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000.[33] In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.[34]\n\n\n\n### Formula Renault and Formula Three[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.[15] This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall.[35] He remained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.[36] Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship.[37] In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,[38] and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.[39]\n\n\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\".[40] He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.[41] He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix[42] and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.[43][44] Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[45] Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the team's young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a \"huge row\" at the end of the season, with Lewis' father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in F3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Lewis' contract; however, Lewis called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the team.[18]\n\n\nHamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone.[46] Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds.[15] He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.[47] After the season British magazine *Autosport* featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.[15]\n\n\n\n### GP2[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season.[48] Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Alexandre Pr\u00e9mat.[49] He secured a dominant win at the N\u00fcrburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.[50] At his home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.[51] In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.[52] Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.[53]\n\n\nHamilton's success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to Ferrari.[54][55] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.[56] He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.[57]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Lewis Hamilton\n\n### McLaren (2007\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n![A silver Formula One car driving around a corner.](image)Hamilton took his first Formula One win at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix in only his sixth Grand Prix.\nHamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton is the first and, as of 2023[update], the only black driver to race in the series.[58][59][60] After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point, including those for the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109). Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012.[61]\n\n\n\n![A group of people dressed in orange celebrate, with Hamilton in the middle wearing a baseball cap.](image)Hamilton and his team celebrate his maiden Formula One World Championship title in 2008.\nHamilton's success continued in 2008 as he amassed five victories and ten podium finishes. As the season reached its conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title between the home favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion in the last race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth position in the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history and to deny race-winner Massa the title by one point.[62][63] This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.[64]\n\n\n\n> \n> There are people that watch and say that I've never had a bad car. I can assure you I have. 2009's car [at McLaren] was very, very far off and was the worst car that I've had.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Hamilton, in comparing his seasons at McLaren in 2009 and Mercedes in 2022.[65]\n\nIn his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories. Hamilton entered the final round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to form for 2012. Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year, Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher.[66]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2013\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132016: Teammates with Rosberg[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Rosberg endured a tense rivalry in their time as teammates.\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble.[67][68] In his first season with the Silver Arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen,[69] alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[66]\n\n\nChanges to regulations for the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final race in Abu Dhabi: \"This is the greatest day of my life.\"[66] New driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton elected to drive under his old karting No. 44 for the remainder of his career.[70]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career No. 44. It was the first season since 1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field did not contain a car bearing the No. 1.[71] Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the title with three races to spare.[66] That year, Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One,[72][73] as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's engine failure in Malaysia in 2016 was a key moment in the Drivers' Championship fight.\nDespite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track, culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[74] Ultimately, a succession of poor starts from Hamilton early in the season and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia meant Rosberg took the title, which he successfully secured before announcing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.[66][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u20132020: Four titles in a row[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2018 season was the first time in the sport that two four-time World Champions (Hamilton and Vettel) competed for a fifth title.\nThe 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the \"Fight for Five\" by journalists and fans.[76][77][78] As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).[66][75] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[79]\n\n\nHaving signed a contract with Mercedes that lasted until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019.[80] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Bull of Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[81][82] After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole positions.[83] His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.[84]\n\n\nHamilton won his seventh drivers' title in 2020, equalling the record set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[85][86] Over the shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton took 11 wins (equalling his previous personal best, but in fewer races) including one in Portugal to break Schumacher's record of 91 wins.[87] He also took 14 podiums and 10 pole positions. Hamilton missed the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting COVID-19,[88] his first race absence since his debut in 2007.[89] Hamilton clinched the title at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix with three rounds to spare and ended the season 124 points clear of his team-mate, Bottas, who finished second in the standings.[90] Amid Formula One's *We Race as One* campaign and growing global support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Hamilton took the knee ahead of every race he entered and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Hamilton and Bottas' W11 cars also sported a black livery as a statement of Mercedes' commitment to diversity.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season: Title battle vs. Verstappen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Verstappen engaged in several on-track battles throughout the 2021 season. Pictured is the 2021 United States Grand Prix.\nEarly on in the 2021 season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen emerged as title favourites.[93] The pair frequently exchanged the championship lead throughout the season\u2014often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track\u2014and entered the last race in Abu Dhabi level on points. In Abu Dhabi, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the race, denying Hamilton his eighth title. During the season, Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 pole positions and 100 race wins, respectively.[94][95]\n\n\nThe season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi's decision to instruct only the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which eliminated any gap between the pair and allowed the Dutchman, running newly fitted soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton on his worn hard tyres.[96][97] Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident.[98] Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director,[99] with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that \"human error\" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, but also that the final standings \"are valid, final and cannot now be changed.\"[100] Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the season as \"one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history\", with Hamilton and Verstappen having \"been head and shoulders\u2014and a lot more\u2014clear of every other driver on the grid.\"[96]\n\n\n\n#### 2022\u20132023: First winless season in Formula One and Mercedes struggles[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton 2022](image)Hamilton during free practice at the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\nHamilton was partnered by George Russell for 2022, in place of the departing Bottas.[101] The season saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise ground effect to generate downforce. During pre-season testing in Bahrain, Mercedes introduced its \"zero sidepod\" car design, which was radically different to that of its competitors. The Mercedes W13 suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season which limited the car's potential;[102] at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the car \"undrivable\".[103] During the first half of the season, Hamilton was marginally low on points compared to Russell, despite having been involved in the development of the W13, he had to try on experimental car setups until the British Grand Prix. As his car development contributions were concluded, he was able to perform better. Hamilton scored more podium finishes and championship points than Russell during the second half of the season.[104] During the season Hamilton set records such as, most consecutive seasons with at least one podium finish, most consecutive seasons with at least one lap led, most races with a single constructor, most Q3 appearances, most top 10 finishes and most chequered flags reached at the Monaco Grand Prix, most podium finishes at a single circuit, most points scored at the Monza Circuit and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix.[105]\n\n\nBy the end of the season, Hamilton achieved nine podiums but failed to achieve a race win or pole position in a season for the first time in his Formula One career. He finished in sixth place in the drivers' championship, 35 points behind Russell, who finished fourth. But Hamilton managed to qualify on higher grid positions and scored more podium finishes than Russell.[106][107]\n\n\nMercedes started the 2023 season with concerns over their competitiveness, with Hamilton saying they were \"not where they wanted to be\" after preseason testing.[108] He finished fifth in the opening race in Bahrain, over 50 seconds behind the winner Verstappen.[109] Hamilton achieved his first podium of the season in Australia to extend his own record.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton during the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix After back to back podium finishes in Spain and Canada, he fought from seventh on the grid to take third place at his home race at Silverstone.[111][112][113]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix Hamilton qualified 0.003 seconds in front of Verstappen to take his 104th pole position and his first since 2021.[114]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2023, the day before the first practice session of the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract to remain with Mercedes through the 2025 season. George Russell also signed a two-year extension, retaining Mercedes' driver pair.[115] At the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton qualified fifth, but would finish the race in third after inheriting the position after Russell crashed out from third place on the last lap.[116]\n\n\n\n## Driver profile[edit]\n\n\n### Driving style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won by over a minute from second-place Nick Heidfeld at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid,[117] excelling across a wide range of areas.[118] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[119] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\"[120][121] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[120]\n\n\nHamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[122] Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of \"how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed\", highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.[18]\n\n\nHamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[123][124] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.\"[125] Ahead of the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said \"I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or physically.\"[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix in torrential rain, and compared the conditions to his victory at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[127][128] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[129] His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\":[130] despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place.[131][130][132][133][134] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton is the most successful British driver in Formula One history, and has won the British Grand Prix a record eight times.\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.\"[135] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[136] In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna's original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show *Top Gear*. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.[137][138]\n\n\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[139] Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\n> \n> As a driver he is absolutely outstanding \u2013 as good as there's ever been. Apart from the talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One. He is box office, 100 per cent.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015[140]\n\nHamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation,[141][142][130] and one of the greatest Formula One drivers.[143][144][145][146][147] Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[note 2] Jim Holden writing in *Autocar* suggests Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One, but one of the greatest British sportsmen.[156] Despite receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been under-appreciated.[157][158] Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance \u2013 being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing \u2013 alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[156] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[159][156]\n\n\n\n> \n> What strikes me now about him now is his maturity ... [Hamilton] recognises he is a role model and the influence he has and the responsibilities that come with it. He is far broader than purely a driver in [Formula One]. He has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. That is part of the greater appeal of Lewis today.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019[160]\n\nHamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised.[161] He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers.[162][159] Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[162] Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[157]\n\n\nFigures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport, noting how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[161] Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83\u00a0billion as of 31 July 2016.[141] Sports journalist for *The Telegraph*, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[163] Following Hamilton's knighthood in 2020,[164] newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton \"is a true giant of our sport\" and that \"his influence is huge both in and out of a car.\"[165]\n\n\n\n> \n> He was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017[166]\n\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\"[18] After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[20] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[167] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons,[144] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[166][168]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton waving to fans after winning the 2018 Italian Grand Prix\nAfter Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[142] an opinion which was widely accepted among the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[141] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history.[167] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[169][170] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike,[171][144][166][172][173][143][174][175][176][177] with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[178][179]\n\n\nFollowing Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[150] a sentiment echoed by his Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described him as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\",[157] while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described Hamilton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[117] After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.[153] Herbert compared Hamilton to tennis player Roger Federer and golfer Tiger Woods.[180]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's 2007 helmet\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[181] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach.[182] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[183] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time, on either side.[184] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's helmet in 2013\nHamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, he sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[186] At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought with him a striking blue-and-green design in honour of team sponsor Petronas but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[187] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words *World Champion*.[188] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title, towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[185] and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[189]\n\n\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[190] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career, saying: \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[191] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix.[192]\n\n\nHamilton switched into a different design in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in support of Black Lives Matter, he also continued to use the same design in 2021.[193] Hamilton wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in support of the LGBTQ+ community.[194] Ahead of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it also used purple details.[195] He also used one-off designs for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.[196][197][198] Hamilton retained the yellow helmet design in 2023.[199]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n#### Fernando Alonso[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alonso (left) and Hamilton (right) at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007.[200] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[201] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"[201]\n\n\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary.[18] Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[202] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[203] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[204] British motorsport journal *Autosport* claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[205] however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.[206]\n\n\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[207][208] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[209] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[210][211][212] Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[213] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[214] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[166] Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[143] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[215]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. Hamilton had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Alonso 10 times. Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of Hamilton only 7 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Nico Rosberg[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hamilton\u2013Rosberg rivalry\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Rosberg (right) at the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[217] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\"[218] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[218] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing.[20]\n\n\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability but with an intellect to match Rosberg's.[139] Buxton wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Man to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his tires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't used too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.[139]\n> \n> \n\n\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[20] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage.[139] However, Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.\"[118][219]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times. Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[220]\n\n\n\n#### Sebastian Vettel[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel 2017 United States GP (38000070491)](image)Hamilton (left) and Vettel (right) at the 2017 United States Grand Prix\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together.[221] After three years of Mercedes' dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018.[222][223][224][225] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty,[226] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight.[227][228][229] In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\n\n\n\n> Mine and Seb's battle were my favourite so far. It's knowing I was racing against an incredible driver, not only that but a great man in Seb who is a four-time world champion and we were racing against another team, he was at Ferrari who were very strong at the time. It took a lot out of both of us in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. That was a difficult period for us and it brought us closer, because the respect we have between us is huge.[230]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\n### Racist treatment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton was racially abused by fans during 2010 pre-season testing at Jerez.\nThe first and, as of 2023, the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix.[231] In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [*sic*]\".[232] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour,[233] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[234] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named *pinchalaruedadeHamilton*, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[235] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.[236]\n\n\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, *The Guardian* journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public.[237] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[238] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[239] and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport.[240] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[241]\n\n\n\n### Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n#### Diversity and anti-racism[edit]\n\n\n> \n> People come up to me from different ethnic backgrounds saying, \"My kid wants to be you one day\", and I can assure you that when I started racing, there weren't people from those [ethnic backgrounds]. I take great pride in that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Hamilton in 2017 commenting on his influence on minority representation in Formula One[242]\n\nHamilton is a prominent advocate against racism and for increased diversity in motorsport.[243][244] He has questioned racial politics in Formula One on several occasions. In 2011, after being summoned to the stewards in five out of the first six races of the season, Hamilton quipped, \"Maybe it's because I'm black, that's what Ali G says.\"[245] In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, describing how nothing had changed in his eleven years in the sport before saying: \"Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in.\"[246][247]\n\n\nHamilton took the knee before every race he entered in the 2020 Formula One season in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Following the murder of George Floyd while being arrested in May 2020, which sparked national and global protests,[248] Hamilton criticised prominent figures in Formula One for their silence on the issue, writing on Instagram:\n\n\n\n\n> I see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice. Not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport. I'm one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. ... I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can't stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are and I see you. ... I do not stand with those looting and burning buildings but those who are protesting peacefully. There can be no peace until our so called leaders make change. This is not just America, this is the UK, this is Spain, this is Italy and all over. ... The way minorities are treated has to change, how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.[249][250][251][252]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing Hamilton's comments, several drivers released statements about Floyd's murder and voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and support was expressed from other figures in the sport such as Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss.[253][249] Ross Brawn, managing director for Formula One, said that the organisation \"supports [Hamilton] totally\", describing Hamilton as \"a great ambassador for the sport\". He acknowledged that Hamilton's comments \"are very valid\" and that the sport \"can give greater opportunity for minority and ethnic groups to get involved in motorsport\". Brawn stated that Formula One was working to increase diversity within the sport, with efforts targeted at increasing driving opportunities at grassroots level as well as across all roles in Formula One.[254]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix weekend, including on the podium, Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing \"Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\" on the front and \"Say her name\" with a photo of Taylor on the back, in reference to the killing of Breonna Taylor. Following an investigation, the FIA announced that only race suits done up to the neck can be worn on the podium and that only official team attire can be worn in the media pen.[255] In anticipation of the FIA's decision, Hamilton said that he recognised that they have \"certain limits that they feel that they have to work within\", but he \"[didn't] regret a single moment of it\" and cited the \"really positive support from the fans\".[244]\n\n\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Hamilton had established The Hamilton Commission with the Royal Academy of Engineering. The commission had been in development since December 2019 but publicly launched to coincide with the heightened media and public interest in the Black Lives Matter movement, and greater scrutiny of race inequality in society. The partnership with the Royal Academy of Engineering was established to find ways in which motorsport can engage more young people from black backgrounds with science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects and, ultimately, employ them in motorsport or in other engineering sectors.[256][257] In May 2021, Hamilton become the first recipient of the inaugural Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year Award for his involvement in the fight against racism.[258]\n\n\nBuilding on the recommendations of the Hamilton Commission, Hamilton launched Mission 44, a charitable foundation created to help young people from under-represented backgrounds achieve their ambitions in wider society, in July 2021. Hamilton pledged \u00a320m of his personal wealth to support the work of the charity, including supporting organisations and programmes that narrow the gap in employment and education.[259] Mission 44 will work in conjunction with a joint charitable foundation between Hamilton and the Mercedes Formula One team, called Ignite, which was also launched in July 2021.[260] Ignite focuses on increasing diversity in motorsport, by improving educational opportunities and offering financial support.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hamilton confronted the Bahrain's human rights abuses and spoke out on the allegations of sportswashing. Hamilton said he \"won't let it go unnoticed\" after an 11-year-old boy, Ahmed Ramadhan, wrote a letter to Hamilton, asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty, after a confession was allegedly extracted through torture for the death of a policeman.[262][263] Hamilton spoke to human rights organisations and legal experts. He also spoke with Bahraini officials about the country's human rights. The F1 champion said that while he had no authority to choose the location for his race, \"going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places\" is not the right way.[264] In July 2021, Hamilton spoke out against the \"cowardly\" anti-LGBT laws in Hungary, after the country introduced a law that limits discussions of LGBT sexualities in school.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental and animal rights[edit]\n\n\nHamilton has repeatedly discussed environmental issues and animal rights at conferences, in interviews and in documentaries.[266][267] He also uses his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives,[268] which range from urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock,[269] and backing charities which fight the illegal wildlife trade,[270] to calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest.[271] In January 2020, he donated US$500,000 (approximately \u00a3383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the bushfire crisis in Australia.[272] The money went towards the fire services and animal welfare charities.[273]\n\n\nIn 2019, Hamilton asked Mercedes-Benz to swap animal-derived leather in the company's models worldwide: \"I am trying to push for sustainability with my team. I am trying to get\u00a0more involved in Formula 1 and be more conscious*.* Mercedes-Benz is a huge organisation. I have got a phone call with the CEO later today to discuss how we can work on getting rid of all the leather supplied to the cars. That is something I want to be involved in.\"[274][275] The next year, he announced his aim of being carbon neutral by the end of the year, saying: \"I don't allow anyone in my office, but also within my household, to buy any plastics. I want everything recyclable, down to deodorant, down to toothbrush, all these kinds of things ... I'm trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space. I sold my plane over a year ago. I fly a lot less now. I'm trying to fly less through the year.\"[276]\n\n\n\n#### UNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Hamilton began working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In March 2012, Hamilton travelled to the Philippines where he made a short film about Manila's street children. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid and helped raise over \u00a34.9 million for UNICEF.[277][278][279] In October 2012, while in India for the Grand Prix, Hamilton visited a UNICEF-funded newborn care unit and nutrition centre. Hamilton said: \"As a sportsman in the public eye, I know I have a role to play in helping to tell the stories of the world's most vulnerable children and I jumped at the chance to be able to do that again after a visit to Manila.\"[280][281][282]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hamilton travelled to Haiti where he made a short film about child malnutrition. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid, and helped raise over \u00a36 million for UNICEF.[283][284][285] In 2015, Hamilton took part in an exhibition to highlight UNICEF's work and to celebrate\u00a0its twenty-year partnership with Starwood Hotels.[286][287] In June 2017, Hamilton joined the Super Dads initiative, a special UNICEF campaign that highlighted the critical role played by fathers in early childhood development.[288][289][290] In August 2017, Hamilton visited Havana with UNICEF to learn more about its first development programmes in Cuba.[291][292]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hamilton partnered with charity campaign #TOGETHERBAND to help promote the United Nations' 17 Global Goals. As part of his campaign work, Hamilton visited Alperton Community School in North West London to speak to the students about the importance of education. Hamilton is a GOAL 4 Ambassador, focusing on the fight to provide quality education to all children.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other charities[edit]\n\n\nOver the past decade, Hamilton has made time for a variety of good causes, such as making hospital visits to sick children.[294][295] He has invited fans, young people, and their families to join him at Grand Prix races and social events.[296][297][298][299][300] In 2013, he became the Global Education Ambassador for Save the Children, supporting and promoting its education campaigns.[301][302][303] Two years later, Hamilton became the first ambassador for the Invictus Games Foundation, supporting wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.[304][305][306] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamilton's Neat Burger restaurant donated free meals to frontline NHS workers.[307][308] Neat Burger also launched the \"Kids Eat Free\" scheme, serving free meals to school children during the half-term break.[309][310]\n\n\nHamilton often donates personal and professional paraphernalia for charity auctions.[311][312][313][314] He auctioned a racing kart and raised over \u00a342,000 for baby charity Tommy's.[28] He raised \u00a36,411 for the Small Steps Project in 2018, and \u00a36,000 in 2019.[315] In 2020, he raised another \u00a34,000 for the Small Steps Project, while a donated race suit reportedly raised \u20ac20,000 for vulnerable children.[316][*citation needed*]\n\n\nHamilton frequently attends charitable functions[317][318][319][320] and has supported projects and charities such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation,[321] Comic Relief,[322] Rays of Sunshine,[323] Children in Need,[324] and Stevenage's Keech Hospice Care Children's Service, among others.[325] He is also involved in charitable work through the creation of his Lewis Hamilton Foundation. Registered in June 2008, the foundation provides grants and donations to a number of charitable causes.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Media reception[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and noted that people felt \"very offended\".[328] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[329] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[330]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Hamilton at Madame Tussauds, London\nHamilton's contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the *Powerlist*, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017.[331][332] In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th *Powerlist*, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement.[333][334] In 2020, he was listed as one of *Time* magazine's 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.[335][336][337]\n\n\nHamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.[338][339][340] That year, Hamilton received criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[341] Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying \u00a33.3\u00a0million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth \u00a316.5\u00a0million.[342] According to BBC *Panorama*, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be \"artificial\" and \"did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use\". The BBC also said that Hamilton's Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips.[342] The jet was sold in September 2019.[343] Despite not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told *The Sunday Times* in 2014: \"What people don't realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here [UK] as well. I am contributing to the country.\"[344][345]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nHamilton also has interests in music, saying that \"music has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don't get to see.\"[346] He features on Christina Aguilera's 2018 song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym XNDA, although he did not confirm this until July 2020, when he revealed he had been writing and recording music for ten years.[347][348] Hamilton also made a guest appearance in *Cars 2* (2011) in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself.[349] He then voiced a voice command assistant in *Cars 3* (2017).[350] Hamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film *The Game Changers*.[351] Hamilton has also revealed he was offered a role as a fighter pilot in the film *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) by Tom Cruise, but was forced to decline due to his Formula One commitments.[352]\n\n\nHe was also served as the \"maestro\" of the *Gran Turismo* series since *Gran Turismo Sport* in 2017[353] and his Time Trial Challenge DLC pack was released in that said game on 28 November 2019.[354]\n\n\nIn 2018, Hamilton launched the clothing line TOMMYXLEWIS during New York Fashion Week with American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin.[355] Hamilton stated \"[g]rowing up, I remember seeing the iconic Tommy Hilfiger flag\" and Hilfiger commented on Hamilton, saying that \"Lewis is bold in everything he does ... He's not afraid to take risks. And he has a cool and sophisticated style that really speaks to the new generation of Tommy fans.\"[356]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Hamilton launched a vegan restaurant named Neat Burger.[357] It claims to be the first international plant-based burger chain.[358] In 2020, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant of the Year at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards.[359] In August 2020, *Daily Front Row* listed Hamilton as one of a group of high-profile investors who purchased *W*, a troubled fashion magazine.[360] In 2021, for the second consecutive year, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards. Neat Burger was also named People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals's inaugural Company of the Year.[361]\n\n\nHamilton also became an Ambassador for the luxury watch company IWC, owned by Richemont. Throughout 2021, Hamilton toured the world via PORTL hologram, first in Europe and then making its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in September.[362]\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, Hamilton launched Team X44 to compete in the all-electric SUV off-road racing series Extreme E from the 2021 season on.[363] The X44 team finished 2nd in the inaugural Extreme E championship, behind Nico Rosberg's RXR team.[364] In January 2022, X44 were crowned inaugural winners of Extreme E Sustainability Award.[365] The team won the 2022 Championship in the final race of the season, beating RXR, who were disqualified from the race.[366]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Hamilton joined the newly-established ownership group of the National Football League's Denver Broncos.[367]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Hamilton founded the production company, Dawn Apollo Films. Its upcoming debut projects include an untitled sports action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski, and an untitled documentary film about Hamilton. Both projects will be co-produced by Hamilton, and released on Apple TV+.[368]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Epic Games added a cosmetic Hamilton player skin to *Fortnite*. A likeness of Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, was also added to the game.[369]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because \"[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world ... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"[370] In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism.[371] In 2018, Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\".[372] His racing number has always been 44 because when he started racing at age 8 his father's red Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate \"F44\" and it was his father's idea to use it.[373]\n\n\nHamilton is a fan of art and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol.[374] Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol's *Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe* painting hanging from a chain around his neck.[375] From November 2007 to February 2015, Hamilton was in an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl group Pussycat Dolls.[376][377]\n\n\nHamilton is a Catholic; he says that he prays regularly and is guided by his faith.[378] Hamilton believes that he has the \"hand of God\" resting over him when racing in Formula One.[379][380] Hamilton is also a supporter of LGBT rights, and strongly criticised the Hungarian government before the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix,[381] while also calling out the \"terrifying\" Saudi Arabian LGBT laws before that Grand Prix.[382]\n\n\nOn 14 March 2022, Hamilton revealed that he is in the process of legally changing his name to include his mother's maiden name, Larbalestier, as a middle name.[383] On 9 June 2022, Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil after a proposal made by politician Andr\u00e9 Figueiredo was passed in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.[384]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month after being caught speeding at 196\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph) on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded.[385][386] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\". After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (\u00a3288), being described as a \"hoon\" by the magistrate.[387][388][389]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton's rights management company 44IP opposed Swatch Group's application to register a trade mark for \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" in Europe for the sale of watches and timepieces. This was likely to have been encouraged, or even required, by Hamilton's own watch sponsor. 44IP alleged that Swatch Group's application was made in bad faith and that it was contrary to \"fair competition\" in relation to 44IP's existing \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" mark. In 2020, the case was heard before the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO rejected 44IP's arguments, ruling that there had been no bad faith by Swatch Group (with \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" having been used on relevant goods since 1892) and that 44IP's \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" trade mark did not extend to the word \"HAMILTON\" alone for the purposes of protecting the existing mark.[390]\n\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK. He later said on the television show *Parkinson* that taxation was also a factor in his decision.[391][392][393]\n\n\nIn 2010, Hamilton, like many other Formula One drivers, moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported \u00a310\u00a0million. Hamilton also owns an apartment in Manhattan, New York which he bought for US$40\u00a0million in 2017, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would live after his retirement.[394]\n\n\n\n### Wealth and income[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a388\u00a0million.[395] In 2018, it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of \u00a3159\u00a0million.[396] In 2020, Hamilton's fortune was an estimated \u00a3224 million, making him the richest British sports star in the history of the *Sunday Times Rich List*.[397]\n\n\nBefore the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix weekend, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One.[72] In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One.[79] According to *Forbes*, Hamilton was one of the highest-paid athletes of twenty-tens decade,[398] and also the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021.[399]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

Schumacher has a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Lewis Hamilton) and, at the time of his retirement from the sport in 2012, he held the records for the most wins (91), pole positions (68), and podium finishes (155)\u2014which have since been broken by Hamilton\u2014while he maintains the record for the number of total fastest laps (77), among others.\n\n\nBorn to working-class parents, Schumacher started his racing career in karting. He won his first karting championship aged six in a kart built from discarded parts. After having enjoyed success in karting\u2014such as winning the 1987 European karting championship\u2014and in several single-seater series, Schumacher made a one-off Formula One appearance with Jordan at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix. He was signed by Benetton for the rest of the 1991 season. He won his first and second drivers' titles consecutively in 1994 and 1995. Schumacher moved to the struggling Ferrari team in 1996. During his first years at the team, Schumacher lost out on the title in the final race of the season in 1997 and 1998 and suffered a broken leg from a brake failure in 1999. He and Ferrari won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004, including unprecedented sixth and seventh titles, breaking several records. After finishing third in 2005 and second in 2006, Schumacher retired from the sport, although he later made a brief return with Mercedes from 2010 to 2012.\n\n\nSchumacher was noted for pushing his car to the very limit for sustained periods during races, a pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him. He and his younger brother Ralf are the only siblings to win races in Formula One and the first siblings to finish first and second in the same race, a feat they repeated in four subsequent races. Schumacher was twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that decided the title: first with Damon Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, and later with Jacques Villeneuve at the 1997 European Grand Prix.\n\n\nAn ambassador for UNESCO, Schumacher has been involved in humanitarian projects and has donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. In December 2013, Schumacher suffered a severe brain injury in a skiing accident. He was placed in a medically induced coma until June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, before being relocated to his home to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher's title-winning German Formula Three car from 1990\nMichael Schumacher was born in the West German town of H\u00fcrth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3 January 1969, to working-class parents Rolf\u2014a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track\u2014and Elisabeth Schumacher (1948\u20132003), who operated the track's canteen.[1] When Schumacher was four, his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Michael crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts and, at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.[2]\n\n\nRegulations in Germany require a driver to be at least 14 years old to obtain a kart license. To get around this, Schumacher obtained a license in Luxembourg at the age of 12.[3] In 1983, he obtained his German license, a year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship. Schumacher joined Eurokart dealer Adolf Neubert in 1985 and by 1987, he was the German and European kart champion, then he quit school and began working as a mechanic. In 1988, he made his first step into single-seat car racing by participating in the German Formula Ford and Formula K\u00f6nig series, winning the latter.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, Schumacher signed with Willi Weber's WTS Formula Three team. Funded by Weber, he competed in the German Formula Three series, winning the title in 1990.[3] He also won the 1990 Macau Grand Prix under controversial circumstances. He placed second behind Mika H\u00e4kkinen in the first heat, three seconds behind. At the start of the second heat, he overtook H\u00e4kkinen, who only had to finish within three seconds of Schumacher to clinch the overall win. In the closing laps, Schumacher made a mistake, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to attempt to overtake. Michael changed his line immediately before H\u00e4kkinen did the same as the latter moved to overtake, and H\u00e4kkinen crashed into the back of Schumacher's car.[5] While H\u00e4kkinen's race was ended, Schumacher drove to victory without a rear wing.[6] Schumacher gave the prize money from winning the race to his family as they had debts.[7]\n\n\nDuring 1990, along with his Formula Three rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing programme in the World Sportscar Championship. This was unusual for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries competed in Formula 3000 on the way to Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long-distance races would help his career.[3] In the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season, Schumacher won the season finale at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez in a Sauber\u2013Mercedes C11, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship despite only driving in three of the nine races. He continued with the team in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in Japan with a Sauber\u2013Mercedes-Benz C291, leading to a ninth-place finish in the Drivers' Championship. He also competed at Le Mans during that season, finishing fifth in a car shared with Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In 1991, he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1991 430 km of N\u00fcrburgring, Schumacher was involved in an incident with Derek Warwick. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved his Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by Schumacher's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased Schumacher on foot. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from several mechanics and Schumacher's teammate Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.[8]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n### Profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"No one will ever be greater than Schumi. Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nToto Wolff about Schumacher[9]\n\n![](image)Schumacher (left) in 1991\nSchumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race and to push his car to the very limit for sustained periods.[10] He was also noted for his pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him.[11][12] In 2004, *Slate* magazine described Schumacher as \"the ultimate driving machine\" and \"the most dominant athlete in the world\" due to him having become \"quicker, stronger, and fitter than the competition by outworking them in the weight room\".[13] The magazine also stated that Schumacher changed the sport as he set a new benchmark for other drivers and built the team and technologies around him.[13] Schumacher exercised four hours a day, mostly to strengthen his neck muscles to better withstand G-forces during races.[14] After his gym session, he would often head to the race track for testing.[14] In 2003, Deutsche Welle highlighted Schumacher's \"natural talent\" for racing and his \"discipline and leadership\".[14] In 2023, former Formula One rival Giancarlo Fisichella noted that Schumacher \"did not even seem to have sweated\" during races, adding that Schumacher is the greatest Formula One driver of all time and \"rewrote the history of Formula One\".[15]\n\n\nIn 2003, *F1 Racing* magazine analysed Schumacher's driving style using telemetry data.[16] It was noted that Schumacher was \"very sensitively and flexibly\" on the gas and brakes. Compared with his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello, who often either braked or accelerated in a corner, Schumacher usually braked later into a corner and stabilised his car by accelerating slightly, often using both the brake and accelerator pedals at the same time. Exiting a corner, Schumacher accelerated considerably and balanced his car by braking lightly. With his driving style, Schumacher went 25 km/h faster through the hairpin corner of the Suzuka Circuit compared to Barrichello, who lost 0.3 seconds to Schumacher in this corner.[16] It was also noted that when needed, such as when the brakes started to overheat, Schumacher adapted his driving style to protect the brakes.[16]\n\n\n*Motor Sport* author Christopher Hilton observed in 2003 that a \"measure of a driver's capabilities is his performance in wet races, because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed\", and noted that like other great drivers, Schumacher's record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes: up to the end of 2003, Schumacher won 17 of the 30 races in wet conditions he contested.[17] Some of Schumacher's best performances occurred in such conditions, earning him the nicknames \"*Regenk\u00f6nig*\" (rain king)[18] or \"*Regenmeister*\" (rain master),[10] even in the non-German-language media. He is also known as \"the Red Baron\", because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German Manfred von Richthofen, the famous flying ace of the First World War. Schumacher's nicknames also include \"Schumi\",[19] \"Schuey\"[20] and \"Schu\".[21]\n\n\nSchumacher has often been credited with popularising Formula One worldwide, especially in Germany, where it was formerly considered a fringe sport.[7][22] In a 2006 FIA survey, he was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans.[23] Throughout his career, however, Schumacher was subject to anti-German prejudices, especially from the British media.[24] When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers in that year's Drivers' standings were German, more than any other nationality. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers.[25] In 2020, Vettel named Schumacher the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[26]\n\n\nDuring a large part of his Formula One career, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[27] In 2006, Formula One rival David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of the sport, while three-time World Champion Niki Lauda stated: \"He is the greatest. Nobody will ever beat him, as long as we are alive\".[28] In 2020, Schumacher was voted the most influential person in Formula One history.[29]\n\n\n\n### Jordan (1991)[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut.[30]\n\n\nThe week before the race, Schumacher impressed Jordan designer Gary Anderson and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at Silverstone. Schumacher's manager Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit, but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, by cycling around the track on a fold-up bike he brought with him.[31] He impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh. This matched the team's season-best grid position, and Schumacher out-qualified veteran de Cesaris. *Motor Sport* journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying \"clumps of German journalists were talking about 'the best talent since Stefan Bellof'\".[32] Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems.[33]\n\n\n\n### Benetton (1991\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix\nFollowing his Belgian Grand Prix debut, and despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by Benetton-Ford for the next race. Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 1991\u20131993[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished the 1991 season with four points out of six races. His best finish was fifth in his second race, the Italian Grand Prix, in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three-time World Champion Nelson Piquet.[35]\n\n\nAt the start of the 1992 season the Sauber team, planning their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton; Peter Sauber stated that \"[Schumacher] didn't want to drive for us. Why would I have forced him?\".[36] The year was dominated by the Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, featuring powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car's ride height.[37] In the \"conventional\" Benetton B192, Schumacher took his place on the podium for the first time, finishing third in the Mexican Grand Prix. He went on to take his first victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, in a wet race at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, which by 2003 he would call \"far and away my favourite track\".[38] He finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1992 with 53 points, three points behind runner-up Patrese and three in front of the Brazilian Ayrton Senna.[39] According to Jo Ram\u00edrez, a close friend of Senna, the Brazilian considered Schumacher \"the next big threat, way ahead of all the other drivers around at the time\".[24]\n\n\nThe Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost also dominated the 1993 season. Benetton introduced their own active suspension and traction control early in the season, last of the frontrunning teams to do so.[40] Schumacher won one race, the Portuguese Grand Prix where he beat Prost, and had nine podium finishes, but retired in seven of the other 16 races.[41] He finished the season in fourth, with 52 points.[42]\n\n\n\n#### 1994\u20131995: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher drove the Benetton B194 to his first World Championship in 1994.\nFile:Michael Schumacher 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.jpgSchumacher on the podium at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\nSchumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994. The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Senna\u2014witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind Senna\u2014and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.[43][44]\n\n\nSchumacher won six of the first seven races and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race. Schumacher made two pitstops without stalling and finished the race in second place. Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen.[45][46] Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of \"launch control\" that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used.[47]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was penalised for overtaking Hill on the formation lap. He and Benetton then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team.[48] Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed.[49] Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block.[50]\n\n\nThese incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36, Schumacher hit the guardrail on the outside of the track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire.[51] As a result, Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship, the first German to do so\u2014Jochen Rindt was German but raced under the Austrian flag. The race stewards judged it as a racing accident and took no action against either driver but public opinion was divided over the incident and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.[52][53][54] At the FIA conference after the race, Schumacher dedicated his title to Senna.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1995 British Grand Prix\nIn 1995, Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton, which now had the same Renault engine as Williams; according to *Motor Sport* author Marcus Simmons, Benetton had the better team, while Williams had the superior car.[56] Schumacher accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Hill. With teammate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship, breaking the dominance of McLaren and Williams, and became the youngest two-time World Champion in Formula One history.[57] The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the British Grand Prix on lap 45, and again on lap 23 of the Italian Grand Prix. Schumacher won 9 of the 17 races, and finished on the podium 11 times. Only once did he qualify worse than fourth; at the Belgian Grand Prix, he qualified 16th, but nevertheless went on to win the race.[58]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1996\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.[59] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari.[60]\n\n\nFerrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles labels such as \"truck\", \"pig\", and \"accident waiting to happen\".[61] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.[22] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.[62] However, Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship,[63] although afterwards, his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 \"an awful car\", a \"piece of junk\", and \"almost undriveable\", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car \"wasn't very good\".[64] During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.[65]\n\n\nSchumacher, Brawn, Byrne, and Jean Todt, have been credited as turning the struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history.[66][67] Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believed the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.[68]\n\n\n\n#### 1996\u20131999[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It was not a race. It was a demonstration of brilliance.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nStirling Moss about Schumacher at the 1996 Spanish GP[69]\n\nSchumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1996 and helped Ferrari to second place in the Constructors' Championship ahead of his old team Benetton. During the season, the car had reliability problems; Schumacher did not finish in 7 of the 16 races. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher took pole position, but suffered engine failure on the formation lap.[70] He won three races, however, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet.[3] Having taken the lead on lap 19, he consistently lapped five seconds faster than the rest of the field in the difficult conditions.[65] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher used well-timed pit-stops to fend off Williams' Jacques Villeneuve. Schumacher also took first place at Monza to win in front of the tifosi (Ferrari fans).[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher celebrates a second-place finish at the 1997 German Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher battles with David Coulthard at the 1998 British Grand Prix.\nMichael Schumacher and Villeneuve competed for the title in 1997. Villeneuve, driving the superior Williams FW19, led the championship in the early part of the season.[72] By mid-season, however, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix at Jerez with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he might not finish the race.[73] As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival on lap 48, Schumacher turned in on him but retired from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. The race stewards did not initially award any penalty, but two weeks after the race Schumacher was disqualified from the entire 1997 Drivers' Championship after an FIA disciplinary hearing found that his \"manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although deliberate not made with malice or premeditation, it was a serious error.\"[74][75] Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake.[74][76] His actions were widely condemned in British, German, and Italian newspapers.[52][76]\n\n\nIn 1998, Finnish driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen became Schumacher's main title rival. H\u00e4kkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16-point advantage over Schumacher. Schumacher then won in Argentina and, with the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes. One of his victories was at the Hungaroring, a track where overtaking is difficult; Schumacher drove 19 consecutive qualifying-like laps to make Brawn's alternative strategy work and to go from third to first place.[77] Ferrari took a 1\u20132 finish at the French Grand Prix, the first Ferrari 1\u20132 finish since 1990, and the Italian Grand Prix, which tied Schumacher with H\u00e4kkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points. H\u00e4kkinen won the Championship, however, by winning the final two races. There were two controversies during the season; at the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start-finish line and stopped to serve his ten-second stop-go penalty (received for overtaking a lapped car (of Alexander Wurz) during a safety car period). There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but, because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane, the win was valid.[78] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed on the racing line in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. His Ferrari lost a wheel but could return to the pits, although he was forced to retire. Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of \"trying to kill\" him.[79] Coulthard admitted five years later that the accident had been his mistake.[79]\n\n\nIn 1999, Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors' title. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the British Grand Prix at the high-speed Stowe Corner; his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track into the barriers and resulting in a broken leg.[80] During his 98-day absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo. After missing six races, he made his return at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix, qualifying in pole position by almost a second. He then assumed the role of second driver, helping Irvine to victory and assisting his teammate's bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari.[81] Irvine stated: \"He [Schumacher] is not only the best driver in the world, he is also the best number two in the world\".[82] However, in the last race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix, H\u00e4kkinen won his second consecutive title. Schumacher later said that H\u00e4kkinen was the opponent he respected the most.[83]\n\n\n\n#### 2000\u20132004: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher won his fourth World title in 2001.\n![](image)Schumacher driving the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro F2002 at the 2002 French Grand Prix, the race at which he clinched the 2002 Drivers' Championship, setting the record for the fewest races in locking up the title\nSchumacher won his third World Drivers' Championship in 2000, and his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with H\u00e4kkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to close the gap in the standings. H\u00e4kkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix. At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins (41) won by his idol Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[84] The championship fight would come down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to H\u00e4kkinen at the start. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came out ahead of H\u00e4kkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship.[85] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as H\u00e4kkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that \"the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest\" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was \"the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year\". Benson also hailed Schumacher as \"unquestionably the greatest driver of his era\".[86]\n\n\nIn 2001, Schumacher took his fourth Drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the Canadian Grand Prix, where Schumacher finished second to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first-ever 1\u20132 finish by brothers in Formula One;[87] and the Belgian Grand Prix, in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins.[88]\n\n\nIn 2002, Schumacher retained his Drivers' Championship. There was some controversy, however, at the Austrian Grand Prix. His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was leading, but in the final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.[89] Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or technical regulation, it angered fans and it was claimed that the team's actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators. Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be \"given\" wins in only the sixth race of the season, particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step,[89] and for this disturbance, the Ferrari team incurred a US$1 million fine.[90] At the United States Grand Prix later that year, Schumacher returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by the second-closest margin in Formula One history of 0.011 seconds on the finishing line.[91] Schumacher's explanation varied between it being him \"returning the favour\" for Austria, or trying to engineer a formation finish\u2014a feat derided as near-impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second.[92] After the end of the season, the FIA banned \"team orders which interfere with the race result\",[93][94] but the ban was lifted for the 2011 season because the ruling was difficult to enforce.[95] In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion.[96] Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning 11 times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Barrichello. This pair finished nine of the 17 races in the first two places.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Indianapolis in 2004, where he won the 2004 United States Grand Prix\nSchumacher broke Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in 2003, after a closely contested battle with his main rivals. Before the season started, the FIA introduced new regulations and a new points system to make the championship more open.[98] The biggest competition came from the McLaren-Mercedes and Williams-BMW teams. In the first race, Schumacher was run off track, and in the following two, was involved in collisions.[99][100][101] He fell 16 points behind McLaren's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Schumacher won the San Marino Grand Prix\u2014despite the death of his mother Elisabeth just hours before the race[102]\u2014and the next two races and closed within two points of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Aside from Schumacher's victory in Canada and Barrichello's victory in Britain, the mid-season was dominated by Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, who each claimed two victories. After the Hungarian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher led Montoya and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by only one and two points, respectively. Ahead of the next race, the FIA announced changes to the way tyre widths were to be measured: this forced Michelin, supplier to Williams and McLaren among others, to rapidly redesign their tyres before the Italian Grand Prix.[103] Schumacher, running on Bridgestone tyres, won the next two races. After Montoya was penalised in the United States Grand Prix, only Schumacher and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen remained in contention for the title. At the final round, the Japanese Grand Prix, Schumacher needed only one point whilst R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen needed to win. By finishing the race in eighth place, Schumacher took one point and assured his sixth World Drivers' title, ending the season two points ahead of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen.[104]\n\n\nIn 2004, Schumacher won a record 12 of the first 13 races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Montoya during a safety car period. Schumacher clinched a record seventh Drivers' title at the Belgian Grand Prix. He finished the season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up Barrichello, and set a new record of 13 race wins out of a possible 18, surpassing his previous best of 11 wins from the 2002 season.[105]\n\n\n\n#### 2005\u20132006: rule changes and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher battling with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen during the 2005 Canadian Grand Prix\nRule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race,[106] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres.[107] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting.[22] The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault's Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind Alonso.[108] Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher stated: \"I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more. It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon. If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance.\"[109] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix. Before that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap, leaving only six drivers on the grid.[110] Schumacher retired in 6 of the 19 races, and finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso.[111]\n\n\n2006 became the last season of Schumacher's Ferrari career. After three races, Schumacher had just 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races; his pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12-year-old record.[112] Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and started the race at the back of the grid, as he stopped his car and blocked part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to work his way up to fifth place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit. By the Canadian Grand Prix, the ninth race of the season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the following three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After further victories in Italy and China, Schumacher led in the championship standings for the first time during the season.[113] After his win in Italy, Ferrari issued a press release stating that Schumacher would retire from racing at the end of the 2006 season, but would continue working for the team.[114] The tifosi and the Italian press, who did not always take to Schumacher's relatively cold public persona, displayed an affectionate response after he announced his retirement.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher overtakes Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen for fourth with three laps to go of his final race for three years at Interlagos, having dropped to 19th early on.\nSchumacher led the Japanese Grand Prix; with only 16 laps to go, his car suffered an engine failure for the first time since the 2000 French Grand Prix, handing Alonso the victory.[116] During the pre-race ceremonies of the season's last race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, former football player Pel\u00e9 presented a trophy to Schumacher for his achievements in Formula One.[117][118] A fuel pressure problem prevented Schumacher from completing a single lap during the third qualifying session, forcing him to start the race in tenth position.[119] Early in the race, Schumacher moved up to sixth place but suffered a puncture caused by the front wing of Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault.[120] Schumacher fell to 19th place, 70 seconds behind teammate and race leader Felipe Massa. Schumacher recovered and overtook both Fisichella and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to secure fourth place. His performance was classified in the press as \"heroic\",[121] an \"utterly breath-taking drive\",[122] and a \"performance that ... sums up his career\".[123]\n\n![](image)BMW Sauber with \"Thanks Michael\" messages towards Michael Schumacher on the back of their cars. Schumacher and Peter Sauber worked together in sports cars before entering F1 in 1992.\n#### 2007\u20132009: new roles at Ferrari, motorcycle racing and injury[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Finali Mondiali celebrations in the F2007\nDuring the 2007 season, Schumacher acted as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's 'super assistant'.[124] Schumacher also helped Ferrari with their development programme at the Jerez circuit. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 Formula One season.[125] During 2008, Schumacher also competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series. At a Superbike cup race at the Pann\u00f3nia-Ring, Schumacher finished third out of twenty-seven\u2014behind professional motorcycle racers Martin Bauer and Andreas Meklau\u2014riding a Honda CBR1000RR.[126]\n\n\nAt the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Ferrari's Felipe Massa was seriously injured after being struck by a suspension spring during qualifying. Ferrari announced that they planned to draft in Schumacher for the European Grand Prix and subsequent Grands Prix until Massa was able to race again.[127] Schumacher tested a modified Ferrari F2007 to prepare himself as he had been unable to test the 2009 car due to testing restrictions.[128] Ferrari appealed for special permission for Schumacher to test in a 2009 spec car, but Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso were against this test.[129][130] In the end, Schumacher was forced to call off his return due to the severity of the neck injury he had received in a motorcycle accident earlier in the year.[131] Massa's place was instead filled by Luca Badoer and, later, Giancarlo Fisichella.[132]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2010\u20132012)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"He played a crucial role when we re-joined F1 and was one of the people who laid the foundation for our future success. We're extremely grateful for everything he did for us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nMercedes' team principal Toto Wolff about Schumacher's influence on the Mercedes team[133]\n\nIn December 2009, Schumacher announced his return to Formula One for the 2010 season alongside fellow German driver Nico Rosberg in the new Mercedes GP team.[134] Mercedes returned to the sport as a constructor for the first time since 1955. Schumacher stated that his preparations to replace the injured Massa had initiated a renewed interest in Formula One, which, combined with the opportunity to fulfil a long-held ambition to drive for Mercedes and to be working again with team principal Ross Brawn, led Schumacher to accept the offer once he was passed fit.[134][135] Schumacher signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth \u00a320 million.[134] He turned 41 in 2010 and his prospects with Mercedes were compared with Juan Manuel Fangio, Formula One's oldest champion who was 46 when he won his fifth title.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2010: return from retirement[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished sixth in the first race of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He finished behind teammate Rosberg in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races; former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher might be \"past it\".[136] Several other former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned \"you should never write Schumacher off\".[137] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties.[138] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's car was designed for him, as he would initially drive for the team, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties.[139]\n\n\nMercedes upgraded their car for the Spanish Grand Prix where Schumacher finished fourth. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher finished sixth after passing Ferrari's Fernando Alonso on the final corner before the finish line when the safety car returned to the pits. Mercedes held that \"the combination of the race control messages 'Safety Car in this lap' and 'Track Clear' and the green flags and lights shown by the marshals after safety car line one indicated that the race was not finishing under the safety car and all drivers were free to race.\"[140] However, an FIA investigation found Schumacher guilty of breaching safety car regulations and awarded him a 20-seconds penalty, dropping him to 12th.[141] In Turkey, Schumacher qualified fifth, and finished fourth in the race, both his best results since his return. At the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Schumacher finished 15th, the lowest recorded finish in his career.[142] In Hungary, Barrichello attempted to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare.[143][144] Schumacher was found guilty of dangerous driving and was demoted ten places on the grid for the following race, the Belgian Grand Prix, where he finished seventh despite starting 21st after his grid penalty. At the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Schumacher was involved in a major accident on the first lap, after Vitantonio Liuzzi's car collided with Schumacher's, barely missing his head.[145][146] Schumacher finished the season in ninth place with 72 points. For the first time since 1991, Schumacher finished a year without a win, pole position, podium or fastest lap.[147]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher finished fourth in the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSchumacher's first points of 2011 were scored in Malaysia where he finished ninth; he later came sixth in Spain and took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, after running as high as second in a wet race.[148] Despite starting last in Belgium, Schumacher finished fifth. The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher lead three laps during the race, marking the first time he had led a race since 2006.[149] In doing so, he became the oldest driver to lead a race since Jack Brabham in 1970.[150] Schumacher finished the season in eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with 76 points.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher qualified fastest at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher at the 2012 US Grand Prix\nHe was again partnered by Rosberg at Mercedes for the 2012 season.[152] Schumacher retired from the season's inaugural Australian Grand Prix, and scored a point in the second round in Malaysia.[153] In China, Schumacher started on the front row, but retired due to a loose wheel after a mechanic's error during a pit stop.[154] After causing a collision with Bruno Senna in Spain, Schumacher received a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix. Schumacher was fastest in qualifying in Monaco but started sixth owing to his penalty.[155] He later retired from seventh place in the race.[156] At the European Grand Prix, Schumacher finished third, his only podium finish since his return to Formula One. At 43 years and 173 days, he became the oldest driver to achieve a podium since Jack Brabham's second-place finish at the 1970 British Grand Prix. In Germany, Schumacher set the fastest lap for the 77th time in his career, and in Belgium he became the second driver in history to race in 300 Grands Prix.[157]\n\n\nSchumacher's indecision over his future plans led to him being replaced by Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes for the 2013 season.[158] In October 2012, Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time,[159] stating: \"There were times in the past few months in which I didn't want to deal with Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix.\"[160] He concluded the season with a seventh-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix; Schumacher placed 13th in the 2012 Drivers' Championship.[161]\n\n\n\n## Helmet[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact.[162] The helmet kept the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.[163] Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals. On the top was a blue circle with white astroids.[164] From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello\u2014whose helmet was predominantly white with a blue circle on top and a red ellipsis surrounding the visor\u2014Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red.[165] For the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories.[166] At the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet, which included the year of his debut and the seasons of his seven World Driver's titles.[167] During his 300th Grand Prix appearance, at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher wore a platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.[168]\n\n\n\n* ![Helmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.](image)\n\nHelmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.\n* ![Bell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.](image)\n\nBell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.\n* ![Schuberth helmet for the 2002 season (Ferrari); at the 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix, Schumacher switched his helmet from Bell to Schuberth, though there was a contract with Bell for the 2001 season.

In 1992, the German Motor Sport Federation awarded him the ONS Cup, the highest accolade in German motorsport; he also won the trophy in 1994, 1995 and 2002.[169] In 1993, he won a Bambi Sports Award and was the first racing driver to receive the Golden Steering Wheel.[170][171] In 1994 and from 2001 to 2003, Schumacher was voted European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association.[172] He was voted Polish Press Agency (PAP) European Sportsperson of the Year from 2001 to 2003.[173] In 1995 and from 2000 to 2002, he was named Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year.[174][175] Schumacher was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1995 and 2004.[176] During the latter year, he was voted Germany's greatest sportsperson of the 20th century, beating Birgit Fischer and Steffi Graf to the accolade.[177] For his sports achievements and his commitment to road safety, Schumacher was awarded Germany's highest sporting accolade, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in 1997.[178] In 2002, for his contributions to sport and his contributions in raising awareness of child education, Schumacher was named as one of the UNESCO Champions for Sport.[179]\n\n\nSchumacher won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2002 and 2004,[180] received the Marca Leylenda award in 2001,[181] was named L'\u00c9quipe Champion of Champions three times (from 2001 to 2003),[182] won the Gazzetta World Sports Award twice (2001 and 2002),[183] and won the 2003 Lorenzo Bandini Trophy.[184] In honour of Schumacher's racing career and his efforts to improve road safety and the sport, he was awarded an FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport in 2006.[185] The same year, ahead of his final race for Ferrari at Interlagos on 22 October, football player Pel\u00e9 presented a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" to Schumacher.[186] A year later, in 2007, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport for his sporting prowess and his humanitarian record.[187] Together with Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher won the Race of Champions Nations' Cup six times in a row for Germany, from 2007 to 2012.[188] In 2017, Schumacher was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame and Germany's Sports Hall of Fame.[189][190] In 2020, Jean Todt honoured Schumacher with the FIA President Award, in recognition of Schumacher's seven World Championships and the \"inspiration his sporting and personal commitments brought to the world\".[191]\n\n\nIn Sarajevo, Schumacher was granted honorary citizenship,[192] while the Assembly of the Sarajevo Canton renamed major city transversal street after him,[193] and earlier a large street mural was painted in a city neighborhood of Dobrinja by a group of artists.[194] Honorary citizenship was also granted by Maranello, Modena and Spa.[195][196][197] He was appointed Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur,[198] was honoured with the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic,[199] and was appointed an ambassador of San Marino.[200] In 2008, the Swiss Football Association appointed Schumacher as the country's ambassador for UEFA Euro 2008, hosted by Switzerland and Austria.[201] In recognition of his contribution to Formula One, the N\u00fcrburgring circuit renamed turns 9 and 10 as the \"Schumacher S\", in 2007.[202] In 2014, the first corner of the Bahrain International Circuit was renamed in honour of Schumacher.[203] He received the State Prize of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2022.[204]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1995, Michael married Corinna Betsch.[205] They have two children, a daughter Gina-Maria (born 20 February 1997) and a son, Mick (born 22 March 1999). Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight.[205] From late 1991 until May 1996, Schumacher resided in Monaco. The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump.[206] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland.[207] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers.[208] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007.[1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season.[209]\n\n\nBefore his skiing accident, his main hobbies included horse riding, motorcycle racing, sky diving, and he played football for his local team FC Echichens.[210][211] Schumacher appeared in several charity football games,[212][213] and organised games between Formula One drivers.[214] He is a supporter of 1. FC K\u00f6ln, his local football club from where he grew up, citing Pierre Littbarski and Harald Schumacher as his idols.[215] He is a Roman Catholic.[216]\n\n\nIn 2006, Schumacher had a voice role in the Disney/Pixar film *Cars*. His character is himself as a Ferrari F430 who visits the town of Radiator Springs to get new tires from Luigi and Guido at the recommendation of Lightning McQueen. During arrival, Luigi and Guido both faint in excitement when they see him. The French film *Asterix at the Olympic Games* features Schumacher in a cameo role as a chariot driver called Schumix. In 2009, Schumacher appeared on the BBC's motoring programme *Top Gear* as the Stig.[217] Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, which the BBC subsequently confirmed. Schumacher was there because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the unique black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show.[218] In July 2021, Netflix announced the first officially approved documentary film about Schumacher\u2014called *Schumacher*\u2014which was released on 15 September 2021.[219]\n\n\nSchumacher was a special ambassador to UNESCO and has donated 1.5 million euros to the organisation.[220] Additionally, he paid for the construction of a school for poor children and for area improvements in Dakar, Senegal. He supported a hospital for child victims of the siege in Sarajevo, which specialises in caring for amputees.[221] In Lima, Peru, he funded the \"Palace for the Poor\", a centre for helping homeless street children obtain an education, clothing, food, medical attention, and shelter. Schumacher told *F1 Magazine*: \"It's great if you can use your fame and the power your fame gives you to draw attention to things that really matter\".[222] For the 2002 and 2013 European flood disasters, Schumacher donated 1 million and 500,000 euros, respectively.[223][224] He donated $10 million for aid after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake,[225] which surpassed that of any other sports person, most sports leagues, many worldwide corporations and even some countries.[226] From 2002 to 2006, he donated at least $50 million to various charities.[227] In 2008, he donated between $5M and $10M to the Clinton Foundation.[228]\n\n\nSince his participation in an FIA European road safety campaign, as part of his punishment after the collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix, Schumacher continued to support other campaigns, such as Make Roads Safe, which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the United Nations to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue. In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible drinking. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the world.[229]\n\n\n\n### Finance and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher was an advertising partner for watchmaker Omega. When he won his third title in 2000, which was the first with Ferrari, the *Speedmaster Racing* was issued in a *Schumacher Edition* having his signature on the back.\nIn 1999 and 2000, *Forbes* magazine listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world.[230] In 2005, *EuroBusiness* magazine identified Schumacher as the world's first billionaire athlete.[231] In 2005, *Forbes* ranked him 17th in its \"The World's Most Powerful Celebrities\" list.[232] A significant share of his income came from advertising; Deutsche Verm\u00f6gensberatung paid him $8 million over three years from 1999 for wearing a 10 by 8 centimetre advertisement on his post-race cap.[233] In 2010, his personal fortune was estimated at \u00a3515 million.[234] In 2017, *Forbes* designated Schumacher as the athlete with the fifth highest career earnings of all-time.[235]\n\n\n\n### 2013 skiing accident[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above M\u00e9ribel in the French Alps. While crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit,[236][237] he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet. According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet.[238] He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where he underwent two surgical interventions.[239] Schumacher was put into a medically induced coma because of traumatic brain injury.[240][241] By March 2014, there were small encouraging signs, and in early April he was showing moments of consciousness as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma.[242]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Schumacher left Grenoble Hospital for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland.[243] In September 2014, Schumacher left the hospital and was brought back to his home for further rehabilitation.[244] Two months later, it was reported that Schumacher was \"paralysed and in a wheelchair\"; he \"cannot speak and has memory problems\".[245] In May 2015, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm stated that his condition was slowly improving \"considering the severeness of the injury he had\".[246]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Felix Damm, lawyer for Schumacher, told a German court that his client \"cannot walk\", in response to reports from December 2015 in German publication *Die Bunte* that he could walk again.[247] In July 2019, former Ferrari manager Jean Todt stated that Schumacher was making \"good progress\" but also \"struggles to communicate\". Todt also said that Schumacher was able to watch Formula One races on television at his home.[248] In September of that year, *Le Parisien* reported that Schumacher had been admitted to the H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou in Paris for treatment by cardiovascular surgeon Philippe Menasch\u00e9, described as a \"pioneer in cell surgery\". Following the treatment, which involved him receiving an anti-inflammatory stem cell perfusion, medical staff stated that Schumacher was \"conscious\".[249]\n\n\nSchumacher's family maintains strict privacy about his condition; as of 2023[update] he has not been seen in public since the accident. In April 2023, *Die Aktuelle* published a \"first interview\" with Schumacher with \"quotes\" about his health and family, but it emerged that these responses had been invented by generative artificial intelligence. Schumacher's family said that they would sue the magazine, which sacked the editor responsible.[250][251]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

Vettel is one of the most successful drivers in Formula One history and has won four World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2010 to 2013. Vettel holds the record for being the youngest World Champion in Formula One. He also has the third-most race victories (53) and podium finishes (122), and fourth-most pole positions (57).[4][5][6]\n\n\nVettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off racing appearance in 2007. As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as a full-time driver for 2008, where he scored a victory in the Italian Grand Prix to become the then-youngest race winner. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010 to 2013, the first of which made him the sport's youngest World Champion. In 2013, he set the then-record for the most consecutive race wins with nine.[7] Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 replacing Fernando Alonso and became Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished both years as runner-up. He parted ways with Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season to race with Aston Martin for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, before retiring from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nVettel was born on 3 July 1987 in Heppenheim, West Germany,[3] to Norbert and Heike Vettel. He has one younger brother, Fabian, a racing driver, and two older sisters: Melanie, a dental technician, and Stefanie, a physiotherapist for disabled children.[9] Vettel suggested in an interview that he was \"terrible\" at school, but he passed his *Abitur* at Heppenheim's Starkenburg-Gymnasium\u00a0[de] with a respectable grade.[10][11] His childhood heroes were \"The three Michaels\": Michael Schumacher, Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He mentioned that he wanted to be a singer like Jackson, but realised that he did not have the voice.[12] Vettel is also a fan of the Beatles, collecting several records, including *Abbey Road* and his favourite song being \"Drive My Car\". In an interview on *Top Gear*, he stated that he is a fan of British comedy such as *Little Britain* and *Monty Python's Life of Brian*. Vettel lives in Thurgovia, Switzerland, amongst other racing drivers and is a fan of German football team Eintracht Frankfurt.[13] Vettel has described himself as competitive, private and impatient. He also appeared in advertisements for Head & Shoulders,[14] and provided the voice of character Sebastian Schnell in the German dub of the 2011 film *Cars 2*,[15] and a voice command assistant in the German and Italian dubs of the 2017 film *Cars 3*.[16]\n\n\nVettel married childhood friend Hanna Prater at a private ceremony in early 2019,[17] and they have three children.[18][19][20] In 2016, *Forbes* estimated that his annual income was $41\u00a0million.[21] Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, his teammate from 2015 to 2018, is a close friend.[22] Besides his native German, Vettel speaks English, French, Finnish and Italian.[23][24] In July 2022, he created his Instagram account,[25] having long eschewed social media.[26] Vettel's first Instagram post was to announce his retirement from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[27]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2023, Vettel announced his involvement with the Germany SailGP Team, as co-owner of the team alongside Thomas Riedel.[28]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nVettel began karting at the age of three, and began racing in karts series in 1995 at the age of eight. He was accepted into the Red Bull Junior Team in 1998,[29] and won various titles, such as the Junior Monaco Kart Cup in 2001. Vettel was promoted to open-wheel cars in 2003, and was given a chance by Derrick Walker to test a Reynard Motorsport Champ Car in a two-day private test at the Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway.[30] A year later, he won the 2004 Formula BMW ADAC championship with 18 victories from 20 races.[31]\n\n\nVettel drove for ASL M\u00fccke Motorsport in the 2005 Formula 3 Euro Series. He was placed fifth in the final standings with 63 points and won the Rookie Cup. He tested for the Williams Formula One team later that year as a reward for his Formula BMW success. Vettel then went on to test for the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[32][33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving at a F3 Euroseries demonstration event in 2006\nVettel was promoted to test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, and participated in the 2006 Formula 3 Euro Series, finishing as runner-up.[34] He also competed in the 2006 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, where he finished first and second at Misano in his first two races. In the next round at Spa-Francorchamps, his finger was almost sliced off by flying debris following an accident, and he was expected to be out for several weeks.[35] Nevertheless, he managed to compete in the 2006 Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort the following weekend, where he finished in sixth place.[36]\n\n\nVettel competed in the 2007 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, and took his first win at the N\u00fcrburgring. He led the championship when he was called up permanently by the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[37]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel on his race debut at the 2007 United States Grand Prix\n### BMW Sauber (2006\u20132007)[edit]\n\n\n#### Test driver and debut[edit]\n\n\nVettel became BMW Sauber's third driver at the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix, when former incumbent Robert Kubica replaced Jacques Villeneuve as second driver for the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.[38] On his testing debut, Vettel set the fastest time in the second Friday free practice.[39] Vettel became the then-youngest Formula One driver to participate in a Grand Prix weekend at 19 years and 53 days.[40] He also set a record for collecting his first fine in nine seconds into his career, as Vettel exceeded the pitlane speed limit on the way to the track.[41] In his second testing session at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions.[42]\n\n\nVettel was confirmed as BMW's test driver for 2007. Following Kubica's crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel was named his replacement at the 2007 United States Grand Prix.[43] He started in seventh position and finished in eighth to become the then-youngest driver to score a point in Formula One.[44]\n\n\n\n### Toro Rosso (2007\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n#### Youngest polesitter and first race win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving for Toro Rosso at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix\nBMW released him in July 2007 to join Red Bull's Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Scott Speed from the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix onwards, as Vettel was already under contract to Red Bull Racing.[45] It was also announced that he would drive for Toro Rosso in 2008 alongside S\u00e9bastien Bourdais.[46]\n\n\nIn the rain-affected Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji, Vettel worked his way up to third, behind Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull Racing's Mark Webber, and seemed to be on course for his and the team's maiden podium finish. However, Vettel crashed into Webber under safety car conditions, forcing both cars to retire. Webber said after the race: \"It's kids isn't it. Kids with not enough experience \u2013 you do a good job and then they fuck it all up\".[47] Vettel was initially punished with a ten-place grid penalty for the following race, but this was lifted after a spectator video on YouTube showed the incident may have been caused by Hamilton's behaviour behind the safety car.[48]\n\n\nVettel finished a career-best fourth a week later at the Chinese Grand Prix, having started 17th on the grid while in mixed conditions.[49][50] He was tipped by Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz as one of the sport's big future stars: \"Vettel is one of the young guys with extraordinary potential [...] He is fast, he is intelligent, and he is very interested in the technical side.\"[51]\n\n\nAfter four races of the 2008 season, Vettel was the only driver to have failed to finish a single race, having retired on the first lap in three of them. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Vettel scored his first points of the season with a fifth-place finish, after qualifying 17th. Toro Rosso's technical director Giorgio Ascanelli explained that something changed at the European Grand Prix in Valencia: \"Suddenly Vettel understood something about how to drive an F1 car quickly. It made a huge difference\u00a0\u2013 not only to the speed he could unlock but also to his ability to do so consistently.\"[52]\n\n\nAt the wet Italian Grand Prix, Vettel became the youngest driver in history to win a Formula One Grand Prix, aged 21 years and 74 days.[53] He led for the majority of the Grand Prix and crossed the finish line 12.5 seconds ahead of McLaren's Heikki Kovalainen.[54] It would also be Toro Rosso's only win.[55] Earlier in the weekend, he had already become the youngest pole-sitter.[56] Toro Rosso team boss Gerhard Berger said: \"As he proved today, he can win races, but he's going to win World Championships. He's a cool guy\".[57] His victory led the German media to dub him \"Baby Schumi\".[58]\n\n\nVettel was named 2008 Rookie of the Year at the Autosport Awards.[59]\n\n\n\n### Red Bull (2009\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009\u20132010: Championship runner-up and youngest world champion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel after winning the 2009 Japanese Grand Prix\n![](image)Vettel driving for Red Bull Racing at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix, where he took the first pole position of the season\nAt the start of the 2009 season, Vettel replaced the retired David Coulthard at Red Bull Racing. He began strongly at the Australian Grand Prix, running in second for the majority of the race. However, a clash with Robert Kubica over second place in the latter stages forced both to retire.[60] He went on to take pole position and the race win at Chinese Grand Prix; Red Bull Racing's maiden pole and win.[61]\n\n\nFurther wins followed in Great Britain, Japan and Abu Dhabi.[62] He won the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position, leading every lap.[63] Vettel won the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the first ever day-night race, to finish second in the World Drivers' Championship standings behind Jenson Button.[64] He also scored his third fastest lap of the year, drawing him level with teammate Mark Webber. However, as Vettel had more second fastest laps, he won the 2009 DHL Fastest Lap Award.[65]\n\n\nVettel took the first pole position of the 2010 season at the Bahrain Grand Prix.[66] He led most of the race but as a result of a spark plug failure, Vettel finished in fourth place.[67] At the Australian Grand Prix, Vettel was appointed as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[68] He took his first win of the season in Malaysia.[69]\n\n\nIn Monaco, Vettel made it a Red Bull 1\u20132 with him second and Webber first. Both were equal on points in the standings, with Webber first based on total wins.[70] At the Turkish Grand Prix, Vettel was running second behind Webber when he made a passing move on his teammate. The two collided, putting Vettel out of the race, with neither driver accepting responsibility for the collision.[71]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, both Vettel and Webber's cars were fitted with a new front wing design. Vettel's wing was damaged in the third practice session, and Webber's sole surviving example was removed and given to his teammate.[72] Vettel qualified in first place, but suffered a puncture. He finished seventh while Webber took the victory. In Japan, he qualified on pole ahead of Webber and went on to win with a lights-to-flag victory. Aged 23 years and 98 days, Vettel became the youngest Grand Prix driver to win at the same track on two occasions.[30] At the inaugural Korean Grand Prix, Vettel led the first 45 laps before retiring with engine failure, handing victory to championship rival Fernando Alonso.[73]\n\n\nWith the 1\u20132 finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Vettel and Webber secured Red Bull Racing's first World Constructors' Championship.[74] Vettel went into the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi with a 15-point deficit to Alonso and a 7-point gap to Webber.[75] He won the Grand Prix from pole to become the youngest World Drivers' Champion in the sport's history, as Alonso only finished in seventh place.[76] Following John Surtees in the 1964 season and James Hunt in 1976, this was the third time in Formula One history that the title winner had not topped the championship table until after the last race.[77]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u20132012: Successful title defences, most poles in a season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel's win at the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix was his first win in the principality, and his fifth from the first six races of the 2011 season.\n![](image)Vettel at the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix where, with four races remaining in the season, he became the youngest double World Drivers' Champion\n![](image)Vettel at the 2012 United States Grand Prix\nVettel started the 2011 season with wins in Australia and Malaysia, before a second-place finish at the Chinese Grand Prix due to poor tyre management, possibly related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio was broken.[78] In Monaco, Vettel led the race but due to another radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not prepared when he came in. The pit stop was slow and he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button. Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps. He was caught by Alonso and Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him.[79] The race was red-flagged with few laps remaining, which allowed teams to change their tyres; when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able to retain the lead and win.[80]\n\n\nAt the European Grand Prix, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) enforced a ban on engine mappings. It was believed by some in the press that this was an attempt by the FIA to thwart Vettel's early domination.[81] Nevertheless, he took pole with the fastest qualifying lap in Valencia Street Circuit's history. Vettel dominated with his first hat-trick of 2011, and won his sixth race out of eight.[82] The FIA implemented another rule change at the British Grand Prix, targeting the blown diffusers. Red Bull believed the changes would cost them about half a second per lap.[83] During the race, Vettel held off Webber for second place, who ignored a radio message from team principal Christian Horner to hold position.[84] It was only the second time in the sport's history that a driver had finished second or higher in each of the first nine races of a season and won at least six of them.[85]\n\n\nVettel's run of fourteen successive front-row starts and eleven successive top two finishes ended at his home race, where he qualified third and finished fourth. In Italy, he took his tenth pole position of the year, in which he joined Ayrton Senna as the only driver to have taken ten pole positions in two separate seasons.[86] A podium finish in Japan secured his second successive title with four races remaining, making him the youngest ever double and back-to-back champion.[87] Vettel won the following race in Korea to become the second driver to take at least ten wins in a season after Michael Schumacher.[88]\u00a0He also helped to secure Red Bull's second successive World Constructors' Championship.[89] Vettel took his eleventh victory of the season in the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, leading every lap from pole position, as well as setting the race's fastest lap to claim his first grand slam.[90] Vettel broke the record for the most pole positions in a season at the season finale in Brazil, after he clinched his 15th pole of the year.[91] He completed the year with 15 poles, 11 victories, and 17 podiums from 19 races; Vettel also earned a record total of 392 points.[92]\n\n\nVettel started the 2012 season with a second place at the Australian Grand Prix, before he finished outside the points in Malaysia following a collision with backmarker Narain Karthikeyan. Vettel and Horner criticised Karthikeyan's driving, with Vettel calling him an \"idiot\",[93] and a \"cucumber\".[94] Karthikeyan hit back, calling Vettel a \"cry baby\".[95] Vettel crossed the line in first place at the Bahrain Grand Prix to go top of the championship standings.[96] Three races without a podium place followed, before he retired at the European Grand Prix after an alternator failure, dropping him to fourth in the standings.[97] In Germany, Vettel finished second behind Alonso but received a 20-second time penalty after the race, as he was off the track when he overtook Button; Vettel dropped back to fifth.[98] He started in 10th place but finished second in Belgium to climb up to second place in the championship.[99] Vettel then retired at the Italian Grand Prix due to an alternator failure, which saw the gap to leader Alonso grow to 39 points with seven races remaining.[100][101] He won next race in Singapore, as he kept the lead until the 2-hour race limit was reached.[102] At the Japanese Grand Prix he took his second career grand slam and coupled with Alonso's retirement, he cut the gap down to just four points.[103] After winning at the Korean Grand Prix, the Indian Grand Prix brought another victory, as Vettel topped all three practice sessions before taking pole position and leading every lap of the race to win.[104]\n\n\nDuring qualifying at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Vettel was told to stop the car due to a fuel pump issue; he was forced to start from the pit lane.[105] From last place, Vettel fought his way back to finish in third place.[106] He started the last race in Brazil with a 13-point cushion against Alonso.[107] On the opening lap, Vettel spun after an incident with Bruno Senna. Following changing weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to finish in sixth place to win the championship by three points and to become the youngest ever triple world champion.[108] He also became the third driver to acquire three consecutive championships, after Juan Manuel Fangio and Schumacher.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132014: Quadruple world champion, nine wins in a row, and departure from Red Bull[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel (left) controversially passing teammate Mark Webber at the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix, despite team orders to maintain position\nVettel started the first two races of the 2013 season on pole position, and at the Malaysian Grand Prix, he lapped over 2.5 seconds faster than teammate Webber in qualifying during a wet session.[110] He won the race, though not without controversy. Vettel ignored the team orders and passed Webber for the lead. Webber was furious after the race and said that Vettel \"will have protection as usual and that's the way it goes\".[111] Team principal Horner, although unhappy with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions. He acknowledged that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident.[112] Vettel claimed that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed Webber despite the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race.[113]\n\n\n\nFollowing wins in Bahrain and Canada, his championship lead was cut at the British Grand Prix as he was denied a likely win due to gearbox failure. Vettel bounced back to win his home race in Germany for the first time. After he finished third in Hungary, Vettel won the last nine races of the season, including grand slams in Singapore and Korea. Vettel set the then-record for most consecutive race wins with nine and he became only the third man after Alberto Ascari and Jim Clark to take consecutive grand slams.[114] He sealed his fourth world title at the Indian Grand Prix.[115]\n\n> \n> *\"It's very difficult for me personally, to receive boos, even though you haven't done anything wrong.\"*\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSebastian Vettel, on being booed on the podium.[116]\n\nOn several occasions during the season, spectators booed Vettel. The booing was widely condemned by fellow drivers, the media and others in the paddock,[117] and Vettel later revealed that it had a negative impact on him.[116]\n\n\nFor the 2014 season and beyond, drivers picked a unique car number to use for the remainder of their Formula One career; Vettel chose the number five. However, as reigning World Drivers' Champion, he carried number one throughout the season.[118] Webber left the sport and was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo, who was promoted from Toro Rosso.\n\n\nVettel struggled with reliability issues throughout winter testing, which forced him to retire at the opening Australian Grand Prix.[119] Reliability problems also forced Vettel to retire at the Monaco and Austrian Grands Prix. Vettel qualified on the front-row for the races in Malaysia, Great Britain and Hungary, and finished on the podium in Malaysia, Canada, Singapore and Japan. After the Russian Grand Prix, he had been outqualified by a teammate over a season for the first time in his Formula One career. In addition to suffering reliability problems, throughout 2014 Vettel struggled to get to grips with the Red Bull RB10,[120] and the Pirelli tyres.[121] He signed off the year by becoming the first defending champion to fail to win a race during a season since Jacques Villeneuve in 1998.[122]\n\n\nIn October, Red Bull had announced that Vettel would be leaving the team at the end of the season to join Scuderia Ferrari, one year before his contract was due to expire.[123] Vettel replaced Alonso and partnered his friend Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen.[124] Vettel mentioned he would like to drive for Ferrari at some point in his career and was already rumoured in 2012 to have a non-binding pre-contract, with options, to join them in 2014.[125] He was denied an early release from his Red Bull contract to test the 2014 Ferrari car in Abu Dhabi.[126] In spite of this, Vettel was present at the Ferrari test \u2013 although not driving the car \u2013 but Red Bull did not enforce any sanctions.[127] Vettel instead made his first appearance in November, completing nearly 100 laps in the 2012 car around the test track of Fiorano.[128]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (2015\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> *The next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true. When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.*\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSebastian Vettel, on his lifelong dream of driving for Ferrari\n\n#### 2015\u20132016: Returning to the top step, a threat to Mercedes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, where he took his maiden win for Ferrari\nVettel made his Ferrari debut by finishing third in the Australian Grand Prix.[129] He followed that up with winning the Malaysian Grand Prix,[130] his first race victory for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost two years. After the race, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with Ferrari made the first win all the more special.[131]\n\n\nHe won the Hungarian Grand Prix to remain a championship contender after he started from third on the grid. He dedicated his victory to the driver Jules Bianchi, who died the week prior from injuries sustained in 2014.[132] At the halfway point of the season, Vettel was 42 points behind championship leader and Mercedes driver Hamilton.[133] Vettel was in third place in Belgium when his right rear blew at high speed on the penultimate lap, likely ending any title chances given Hamilton's win. After the race, he ranted about the 'unacceptable' and 'unsafe' Pirelli tyres that could have caused him serious injury.[134]\n\n\nVettel came home second in the Italian Grand Prix, his first race with Ferrari at the team's home soil.[135] He then took his first pole with the team at the Singapore Grand Prix,[136] Ferrari's first pole for three years. Vettel went on to win the race, and with Hamilton retiring, he closed to within 49 points with seven races remaining.[137] Vettel ended the season in third place, however, with three wins and 13 podiums; he declared the season as a 'miracle'.[138]\n\n\nAfter a third-place finish at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix,[139] Vettel's participation in Bahrain ended without starting as his car broke down on the formation lap.[140] At the Chinese Grand Prix, Vettel collided with teammate R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen on the first lap, but both were able to continue. He blamed Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat for the collision, labelling him a \"madman\" and described his overtaking manoeuvre as \"suicidal\".[141] At the Russian Grand Prix, Vettel retired on the first lap after two consecutive collisions with Kvyat.[142] At the Mexican Grand Prix, Vettel attempted to overtake Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, but after Verstappen ran off the track and rejoined ahead of him, Vettel verbally attacked him and race director Charlie Whiting, for which he later apologised.[143] Vettel then blocked Red Bull's Ricciardo by moving in the braking zone, and was given a ten-second penalty and two points on his licence.[144] Although he achieved seven podium finishes during the season, Vettel did not win any races in 2016.[145]\n\n\n\n#### 2017\u20132018: Championship challenges ending in disappointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel during pre-season testing for Ferrari in 2017\nHis third season at Ferrari started with victory in Australia, his first in 18 months.[146] The early form continued the following races, winning in Bahrain and Monaco,[147][148] and finishing second in China, Russia and Spain.[149] In Russia, Vettel took his first pole position in 18 months and with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen alongside him, Ferrari had their first front row lock out since the 2008 French Grand Prix.[150] Vettel's lead at the top of the standings increased to 25 points after the Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari's first victory at the circuit since Schumacher won there in 2001.[148]\n\n\nIn Azerbaijan, Vettel collided into the rear of race leader Hamilton under the safety car, accusing Hamilton of brake testing him.[151] Moments later, Vettel pulled alongside and hit his Mercedes as they prepared for a restart, for which he received a ten-second stop-go penalty.[152] The FIA investigated the Vettel-Hamilton incident further, but Vettel received no punishment. Vettel took full responsibility, issuing a public apology and committing to devote personal time over the next 12 months to educational activities across a variety of FIA championships and events.[153]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix\nVettel's championship lead was cut to only a single point in Great Britain, as he suffered a puncture on the penultimate lap and dropped to seventh place.[154] Vettel started from pole in Hungary and maintained the lead. He overcame steering issues and held on for victory, which gave him a 14-point lead over Hamilton.[155] Mercedes dominated after the summer break and Vettel lost the championship lead at the Italian Grand Prix,[156] which was followed by a first-lap retirement in Singapore after collision with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Verstappen. It was the first time in Formula One history that both Ferraris retired from the first lap of a Grand Prix.[157] His title hopes were dealt another blow in Malaysia, as he started last following a turbo problem in qualifying. He finished in fourth place, but crashed with Williams' Lance Stroll on the cool-down lap; neither would be penalised.[158] More reliability issues befell Ferrari in Japan as Vettel retired due to a spark plug failure.[159] In Mexico, Vettel became the fourth driver in Formula One history to claim 50 pole positions.[160] Verstappen took the lead from Vettel at the start, before Vettel collided with Hamilton, after which Hamilton won his fourth title.[161] For the first time in his career, Vettel failed to win the World Drivers' Championship having led it at some stage during a season.[162]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vettel driving past his fans at the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix\nThe 2018 season was dubbed the \"Fight For Five\" by the media, as for the first time in Formula One history, two quadruple world champions lined up at the start of a season.[163] For the second consecutive year, Vettel began the season with victory in Australia, after he took the lead while pitting under the virtual safety car.[164] It was his 100th podium, while he also became only the third man in Formula One history to have led 3,000 laps.[165] In Bahrain, Vettel maintained the lead from pole through the first round of pit stops and held off Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas despite being on old soft tyres to take a fourth victory at the circuit.[166] At the Chinese Grand Prix, he was hit by Verstappen in the latter stages of the race, which caused both to spin. Vettel limped home in eighth place, with his championship lead reduced to nine points.[167] For the first time since 2013, Vettel took three consecutive pole positions as he qualified in first place in Azerbaijan. It was the 23rd different Grand Prix at which he had taken pole position, equalling Hamilton's then-record.[168]\n\n\nAt the Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel won for the third time in 2018 and for the 50th time in his career, becoming only the fourth man to reach a half-century of wins.[169] The following race in France, Vettel lost the championship lead following a collision with Bottas.[170] He bounced back in Great Britain, after he passed Bottas in the last laps to take victory.[171] Vettel led his home race until he slid off the track and hit the wall in the latter stages as rain started to fall, as he had clipped the sausage curb a few laps before, breaking a part of his front wing, causing understeer and loss of downforce;[172][173] he won in Belgium, however, in which he passed Hamilton for the race victory.[174] Contact on the opening lap with Hamilton in Italy saw Vettel damage his front wing and drop to the back of the field, but he recovered to cross the finishing line in fourth place. It left Vettel 30 points behind the Mercedes driver with seven races left.[175] His championship hopes were dealt a further blow as Ferrari's upgrades introduced at the Singapore Grand Prix proved to be unsuccessful, making a step backwards on car development; Ferrari suffered a dip of form until the United States Grand Prix, where they reverted to their old package and successfully rediscovered their form.[176][177] Vettel claimed his first ever podium in Mexico but the World Drivers' Championship went to Hamilton for a second consecutive year.[178] Although Mercedes had been the more consistent and better team,[179] fans and pundits criticised Vettel for making too many mistakes during the season.[180]\n\n\n\n#### 2019\u20132020: Difficult ending at Ferrari[edit]\n\n\nAfter showing impressive pace throughout pre-season testing in Barcelona, Vettel and his new teammate Charles Leclerc headed to Australia with many pundits believing they had the car to beat for the 2019 season.[181] The opening weekend proved to be difficult, however, as Vettel qualified some seven tenths off pole position in third and finished the race in fourth place.[182] Third-place finishes in China and Azerbaijan followed, as Mercedes continued to dominate.[183] Vettel took pole position in Canada; his first pole in 17 races.[184] Midway through the race, a snap of oversteer caused him to run wide onto the grass. Vettel received a five-second time penalty from the stewards, who believed he had returned to the track \"in an unsafe manner and forced [Hamilton] off track\".[185] Vettel crossed the line in first place but lost his victory as a result of the penalty. After the race, he swapped the number one and two signs in front of Hamilton's Mercedes and the empty spot that was supposed for his own car, as Vettel parked his car at the start of the pit entry.[186] At the German Grand Prix, Vettel was unable to qualify after a turbo issue, which meant he would start in last place. During a race with mixed weather conditions, Vettel climbed up to second place.[187]\n\n![](image)Vettel driving the SF90 at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix In Italy, Vettel spun at the Ascari chicane and when he re-entered the track, he made contact with Racing Point's Stroll. Vettel received a 10-second stop-go penalty and finished in 13th place.[188] At the Singapore Grand Prix, Vettel won on a circuit Ferrari were expected to struggle at. For the first time, Vettel had won five times at the same track.[189] The following race, in Russia, Vettel went from third place on the grid to first place in the first corner. However, radio transmissions suggested that the team wanted to swap their drivers, but with Vettel the quicker driver, he remained in front. Vettel retired soon after with a MGU-K problem.[190]\n\n\nVettel took pole position in Japan,[191] but an abrupt start off the line caused him to momentarily stop before getting away, which allowed Bottas to take the lead; Vettel was not penalized for his jump start.[192] After running in third at the Brazilian Grand Prix for the majority of the race, a safety car allowed Red Bull's Alexander Albon and an aggressive Leclerc to overtake him. He tried to pass his teammate immediately but the two Ferraris collided, resulting in another retirement for Vettel.[193] He finished fifth in the World Drivers' Championship, and was outscored by a teammate for only the second time across a season.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel competing for Ferrari on their 1000th Grand Prix\nFerrari later announced they would not extend Vettel's contract beyond the 2020 season. Team principal Mattia Binotto explained there was \"no specific reason\" for the decision, though both parties noted it was an amicable agreement.[195] The season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the first ten races of the original calendar were either rescheduled, postponed or cancelled altogether. Ferrari discovered problems on their car following pre-season testing, forcing them to make a major redesign.[196]\n\n\nThe SF1000 lacked pace as Vettel finished the season's opening race in Austria in 10th place.[197] During the weekend, he was also given a warning for breaching the FIA's COVID-19 protocols after he was seen mixing with members of his former team Red Bull.[198] The following race, at the Styrian Grand Prix, Vettel retired on the opening lap with rear wing damage following a collision with Leclerc.[199] He ended the season in a disappointing 13th place in the Drivers' standings, with a third place in Turkey as his best result.[200] Ferrari only finished sixth in the Constructors' standings, their worst result since 1980, while Vettel's total of 33 points was the lowest in a full campaign in his Formula One career.[201][202]\n\n\n\n### Aston Martin (2021\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel at the 2021 British Grand Prix\nVettel joined Aston Martin for the 2021 season, replacing Sergio P\u00e9rez.[203] In his debut race weekend in Bahrain, he received a grid penalty in qualifying, forcing him to start last. While Vettel started well, he had a collision with Esteban Ocon, giving him a time penalty and ended up finishing in 15th place. He received five penalty points on his superlicence.[204] Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer reported no concerns, owing to this being a very different car from the Ferrari, lack of laps in pre-season testing and a very impressive race start.[205] In the fifth race of the season, Vettel scored his first points for the team with a fifth-place finish in Monaco.[206] At the following race, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, he claimed Aston Martin's first podium with a second-place finish.[207] Vettel also finished second in Hungary, but was later disqualified, after his car failed to provide the one litre sample of fuel required.[208] He ended the season in 12th place in the Drivers' standings, ahead of teammate Stroll.[209] During the season, Vettel made 132 overtakes\u2014the most of any driver\u2014and won the inaugural Overtake Award.[210]\n\n\nVettel missed the first two races of the 2022 season in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia after testing positive for COVID-19; he was substituted by Aston Martin's reserve driver Nico H\u00fclkenberg.[211][212] In July 2022, Vettel announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[213]\n\n\n\n## Race of Champions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel at the 2007 Race of Champions\nVettel competed in the 2007 Race of Champions at Wembley Stadium, representing the German team alongside Michael Schumacher,[214] winning the Nations' Cup title. He also teamed up with Schumacher from 2008 to 2012, winning the Cup on every occasion.[31]\n\n\nVettel returned to the 2015 Race of Champions, representing Germany together with Nico H\u00fclkenberg.[215] He won his very first individual Race of Champions title that year, beating Tom Kristensen in the final.[216] Vettel and H\u00fclkenberg finished runner-up in the Nations Cup.[31] In 2017, Vettel was eliminated in the first heat for the individual competition,[217] but went on to win the Nations' Cup for Germany by himself with his seventh victory,[218] after his teammate Pascal Wehrlein was injured earlier in a crash.[219]\n\n\nIn the 2019 event, Vettel teamed up with Mick Schumacher, where they finished runners-up in the Nations' Cup to the Nordic team of Kristensen and Johan Kristoffersson.[220] Vettel was eliminated in the group stages of the individual competition,[221] although he won the ROC Skills Challenge.[222] He reached the individual final in 2022 but was beaten by S\u00e9bastien Loeb.[223]\n\n\n\n## Helmet design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2017 helmet design\nFrom his karting days, Vettel worked with helmet designer Jens Munser. At the age of eight, Vettel wanted Sebastian the crab from *The Little Mermaid* on his helmet.[224] Vettel's original helmet in Formula One, like most Red Bull-backed drivers, was heavily influenced by the energy drink company logo. New to Vettel's helmet at the start of 2008 was the incorporation of the red cross shape of the Kreis Bergstra\u00dfe coat of arms on the front, just underneath the visor, in honour of the region of his birthplace, Heppenheim.\n\n\nAfter switching to Red Bull in 2009, Vettel regularly used a variety of new helmet designs. Some designs were small changes to his original Red Bull design, while others were completely new designs, such as the one he used at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix: Vettel had a special white-red helmet design, with black kanji and hiragana for \"gives you wings\". Several of his helmet designs also featured his team members.[225] At the 2012 Italian Grand Prix, Vettel celebrated his 50th helmet design with a 'rusty' matte look and 50 tallies, indicating his 50 helmet designs in Formula One.[226] Vettel started his 2013 campaign with a design in honour of Felix Baumgartner, for his world record Red Bull Stratos space jump in October 2012.[227] By the end of the 2013 season, he had used 76 different helmet designs throughout his career.[228]\n\n\nFor the 2017 Italian Grand Prix he changed the German flag stripe on his helmet to an Italian flag stripe in celebration of Ferrari's home race.[229] Following the death of Niki Lauda, Vettel wore a special helmet based on Lauda's final Ferrari helmet at the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix.[230]\n\n\n\n## Car names[edit]\n\n\nInspired by American bomber pilots in the Second World War, Vettel made it a tradition to name his cars. He said: \"It's important to have a close relationship with a car. Like a ship, a car should be named after a girl as it's sexy\".[231] The car he drove for his first full season in 2008, the Toro Rosso STR3, was named Julie, followed by Kate and Kate's Dirty Sister (2009), Luscious Liz and Randy Mandy (2010), Kinky Kylie (2011), Abbey (2012) and Hungry Heidi (2013). Vettel's car for 2014, the Red Bull RB10, was baptised Suzie. Vettel continued this tradition with Ferrari and christened his 2015 Ferrari SF15-T Eva, followed by Margherita (2016) Gina (2017), Loria (2018), Lina (2019), and Lucilla (2020).[232] In 2021, he named his Aston Martin AMR21 car after Honey Ryder, a character from the James Bond film, *Dr. No*.[233]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Car\n | Name(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **2008** | Toro Rosso STR3 | Julie\n |\n| **2009** | Red Bull RB5 | KateKate's Dirty Sister\n |\n| **2010** | Red Bull RB6 | Luscious LizRandy Mandy\n |\n| **2011** | Red Bull RB7 | Kinky Kylie\n |\n| **2012** | Red Bull RB8 | Abbey\n |\n| **2013** | Red Bull RB9 | Hungry Heidi\n |\n| **2014** | Red Bull RB10 | Suzie\n |\n| **2015** | Ferrari SF15-T | Eva\n |\n| **2016** | Ferrari SF16-H | Margherita\n |\n| **2017** | Ferrari SF70H | Gina\n |\n| **2018** | Ferrari SF71H | Loria\n |\n| **2019** | Ferrari SF90 | Lina\n |\n| **2020** | Ferrari SF1000 | Lucilla\n |\n| **2021** | Aston Martin AMR21 | Honey Ryder |\n\n\n## Comparison to Michael Schumacher[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vettel and Michael Schumacher after the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix, where Vettel won his second World Championship title\nVettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\".[234]\n\n\nNevertheless, the similarities were marked. Like Schumacher, Vettel grew up in a small town with an everyday background\u2014Schumacher's father is a bricklayer and Vettel's is a carpenter. Both had their first taste of racing at the Kerpen karting track near Cologne, not far from the N\u00fcrburgring. Vettel began driving in his garden lapping the garden many times before he could legally take to the roads, and said his passion for cars was nurtured by watching Schumacher compete.[235]\n\n\nAfter winning his first championship in 2010, and being hailed as the \"Next Schumacher\", Vettel stated he did not want to aim for Schumacher's record after learning how hard it was to get one championship under his belt, though he would like to win more.[236] In 2011, Pirelli director Paul Hembery was impressed when Vettel was the only driver to take the time to visit the factory and talk to the tyre manufacturer to gain a better insight. \"The only other driver that asks us a lot of questions is Michael Schumacher. It is like seeing the master and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at work.\"[237]\n\n\nAfter Schumacher was severely injured in a skiing accident in late 2013, Vettel was on hand to collect the Millennium-Bambi Award for Schumacher's life achievements on his behalf in 2014.[238] In 2014, Vettel cited Schumacher as one of his inspirations in becoming a Scuderia Ferrari driver: \"When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\nVettel has demonstrated an interest in the environment and other social justice issues. Following the 2021 British Grand Prix, he helped remove litter from the stands,[240] and he also worked with children in Austria to build a hotel for bees.[241] A second bee hotel would be erected at the Suzuka International Racing Course ahead of the 2023 Japanese Grand Prix.[242] Furthermore, Vettel has been critical of how F1 races are scheduled, stating that races that are geographically proximate to each other should be held on consecutive weekends to reduce emissions from travelling.[243] He also held an all-women karting event during the weekend of the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix,[244] and wore the pride flag at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix despite being reprimanded.[245] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Vettel expressed an intent to boycott the September's Russian Grand Prix had the race gone ahead as planned.[246]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Vettel appeared on the BBC One political topical debate programme *Question Time* to discuss a variety of issues including climate change, energy dependency, and Brexit.[247] The following month, Vettel appeared on the cover of *Attitude*, voicing support for an LGBTQ driver competing in Formula One.[248] In June 2022, while participating in the Canadian Grand Prix, Vettel denounced Canada's mining of the Alberta oil sands by wearing a T-shirt and helmet patch calling it \"Canada's climate crime\". Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called it \"over-the-top hypocrisy\" because Vettel's team, Aston Martin, is sponsored by petroleum company Saudi Aramco, which he said has \"one of the worst climate-emissions records in the world\".[249] Vettel agreed with the \"hypocritical\" label but said those personal attacks risk missing what he called the \"bigger picture\" of the climate crisis.[250]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nVettel was named Rookie of the Year at the 2008 Autosport Awards. In 2009, Vettel was awarded the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy, for his achievements in the 2008 season. He was also awarded the 2009 British Racing Drivers' Club Johnny Wakefield Trophy for \"setting the fastest race lap of the season on the Silverstone Grand Prix Circuit\".[251] In 2010, Vettel was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year and won the *Autosport* International Racing Driver Award, which he also won in the following three years.[252] In January 2012, Vettel was honoured with the Grands Prix de l'Academie des Sports, and in February, he was further honoured with the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in recognition of his world titles and his \"exemplary character\".[253] Vettel was voted Formula One driver of the year in 2009,[254] 2011[255] and 2013[256] by the team principals, initiated by the *Autosport* magazine. He additionally won the DHL Fastest Lap Award in 2009, 2012 and 2013. He was named European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association in 2010,[257] and by the Polish Press Agency in 2012[258] and 2013.[259] Furthermore, Vettel was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 2013. He was named Sportsman of the Year at the 2014 Laureus World Sports Awards.[260] In 2015, he received the Confartigianato Motori Award for Driver of the Year.[261] After retiring from Formula One in 2022, Vettel received the *Autosport* Gregor Grant Award for his \"achievement in motorsport\".[262]\n\n\nRed Bull Racing sponsor Infiniti released a Sebastian Vettel edition of the Infiniti FX SUV for 2012. It featured increased engine power, revised bodywork and lower suspension than the standard model.[263]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

A four-time Formula One World Drivers' Champion, from 1987 until 2001 he held the record for most Grand Prix victories until Michael Schumacher surpassed Prost's total of 51 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. \n\n\nProst discovered karting at the age of 14 during a family holiday. He progressed through motor sport's junior ranks, winning the French and European Formula Three championships, before joining the McLaren Formula One team in 1980 at the age of 24. He finished in the points on his Formula One debut \u2013 at the San Mart\u00edn Autodrome in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he took his first podium a year later \u2013 and took his first race victory a year later at his home Grand Prix in France, driving for the factory Renault team.\n\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s Prost formed a fierce sporting rivalry, mainly with Ayrton Senna but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. In 1986, at Adelaide in the last race of the season, he beat Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title, after Mansell retired late in the race and Piquet was pulled in for a late precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a series of controversial clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out. Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After a sabbatical in 1992, he joined the Williams team, prompting Mansell, the reigning Drivers' Champion, to leave for CART. With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship and retired from Formula One driving at the end of the year.[1]\n\n\nIn 1997, Prost took over the French Ligier team, running it as Prost Grand Prix until it went bankrupt in 2002. From 2003 to 2012 he competed in the Andros Trophy, an ice racing championship, taking 38 race victories and winning the championship three times. Prost employed a smooth, relaxed style behind the wheel, deliberately modelling himself on personal heroes like Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark.[2] He was nicknamed \"The Professor\" for his intellectual approach to competition. Though it was not a name he particularly cared for, he would admit later that it was an appropriate summation of his approach to his racing. Skilled at setting up his car for race conditions, Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAlain Prost was born in the commune of Lorette near the town of Saint-Chamond, in the d\u00e9partement of Loire close to Saint-\u00c9tienne, France to Andr\u00e9 Prost and Marie-Rose Karatchian, born in France of Armenian descent.[3][4] Prost had one younger brother called Daniel, who died of cancer in September 1986.[5][4] Prost was an active and athletic child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including wrestling, roller skating and football. In doing so he broke his nose several times.[3][4] He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered kart racing at the age of 14 while on a family holiday. This new sport quickly became his career of choice.[3][4]\n\n\nProst won several karting championships in his teens. In 1974, he left school to become a full-time racer, supporting himself by tuning engines and becoming a kart distributor. His prize for winning the 1975 French senior karting championship was a season in French[6] Formula Renault,[7][3] a category in which he won the title and all but one race in 1976.[8]\n\n\nProst went on to win the 1977 Formula Renault European championship before moving up to Formula Three (F3) in 1978. In 1979, he won both the French and European F3 championships, by which time he was on the shopping lists of several Formula One teams.[7] After carefully considering his options, he chose to sign with McLaren for 1980.[3] He surprised the British team by declining their offer of a race drive in a third car at the final race of the 1979 season at Watkins Glen \u2014 reasoning that the token effort would benefit neither him nor the team.[9] Prost felt that it would be a mistake to race in Formula One without being fully prepared: \"..in the end I said, \u2018No' to Marlboro. I asked them to understand that I didn't want to make a mistake; I didn't know Watkins Glen and I didn't know the car. I said I thought it would be a better idea to organise a test.\"[10]\n\n\n\n## Formula One[edit]\n\n\n### McLaren (1980)[edit]\n\n\nProst began his career with McLaren (being run by Teddy Mayer) in 1980 alongside Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he finished in sixth place, earning one point, something achieved by only a handful of drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the previous round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.[9][11][7]\n\n\n\n### Renault (1981\u201383)[edit]\n\n\nProst was partnered with fellow Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux for 1981. Motor sports author Nigel Roebuck reports that there were problems between Prost and Arnoux from the start of the season, Prost being immediately quicker than his more experienced teammate.[12] He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with Andrea de Cesaris in Long Beach and Didier Pironi at Jacarepagu\u00e1, but scored his first podium finish at Buenos Aires. He also did not finish in the next four races, and then won his first Formula One race at his home Grand Prix in France at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.[13][14]\n\n\nFor Prost, his debut victory was memorable mostly for the change it made in his mindset. \"Before, you thought you could do it,\" he said. \"Now you know you can.\"[3] Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first pole position in Germany and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, seven points behind champion Nelson Piquet.[15]\n\n\nProst won the first two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost recovered from losing a wheel,[16] and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified.[17] He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth,[18] but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race.[19] His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that \"When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. I think, to be honest, I had made the mistake of winning! The French don't really like winners.\"[12]\n\n\nIn November 1982, three years before it became a round of the F1 World Championship, Prost, along with fellow F1 drivers Jacques Laffite and Nelson Piquet, made the trip to Melbourne, Australia to drive in the non-championship 1982 Australian Grand Prix at the short (1.609\u00a0km (1.000\u00a0mi)) Calder Park Raceway. Driving a Formula Pacific spec Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford engine, Prost sat on pole for the race with a time of 39.18. He then led every lap to win what would be the first of 3 Australian Grand Prix wins. He finished 15.32 seconds clear of Laffite, with 1981 Australian Grand Prix winner, young Brazilian driver Roberto Moreno finishing third.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost's 1983 Renault RE40, in which he came close to winning his first championship\nArnoux left Renault in 1983 and American Eddie Cheever replaced him as Prost's partner, allegedly because of Renault's desire to sell more road cars in North America (three of the season's 15 races were on the North American continent). Prost earned a further four victories for Renault during the season and finished second in the Drivers' Championship, two points behind Nelson Piquet. Piquet and the Brabham team overhauled Prost and Renault in the last few races of the season. Prost, who felt the team had been too conservative in developing the car, found himself increasingly at odds with Renault's management, who made him the scapegoat for failing to win a championship. In addition to that, the French fans recalled the bitter fight that had caused their favourite, Arnoux, to leave the team. Prost said in an interview with ESPN during the final race that his car was \"not competitive\" and that he \"didn't lose by my own fault\"[21] Renault fired Prost only two days after the South African race. He re-signed for McLaren for the 1984 season within days and moved his family home to Switzerland after Renault factory workers burned the second of 2 of Prost's cars, one of them being a Mercedes-Benz.[12]\n\n\n\n### McLaren (1984\u20131989)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost in 1984\n#### 1984\u20131986[edit]\n\n\nProst joined double world champion Niki Lauda at McLaren (now being run by Ron Dennis) in 1984, driving the John Barnard designed McLaren MP4/2 which used a 1.5 litre TAG-Porsche V6 engine. He lost the world championship to Lauda in the final race of the season in Portugal by half a point, despite winning seven races to Lauda's five,[18] including winning in Portugal.[22] The half point came from the Monaco Grand Prix, where Prost had been leading, albeit with Ayrton Senna (Toleman) and Stefan Bellof (Tyrrell) closing on him rapidly, when Clerk of the Course Jacky Ickx stopped the race at half distance due to heavy rain, which was controversial, for Ickx displayed the red flag without consulting the race officials. Under Formula One regulations, Prost received only half of the nine points normally awarded for a victory.[23] Prost's seven wins in 1984 equalled the record set by Jim Clark in 1963.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost driving the McLaren MP4/2B at the 1985 German Grand Prix\n![](image)Cockpit of Prost's F1 McLaren TAG-Porsche turbo, from his first Championship year\nIn 1985 Prost became the first French Formula One World Champion. He won five of the sixteen Grands Prix during the season. He had also won the San Marino Grand Prix, but was disqualified after his car was found to be 2\u00a0kg underweight in post-race scrutineering.[18][25] Prost finished 20 points ahead of his closest rival, Michele Alboreto.[26] Prost's performance in 1985 earned him the L\u00e9gion d'honneur distinction in France.[8][27]\n\n\nNiki Lauda retired for good at the end of 1985, and was replaced at McLaren by 1982 World Champion Keke Rosberg for 1986. Prost successfully defended his title, despite his car struggling against the Honda-powered Williams cars driven by Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. Until the latter stages of the final race of the 1986 season, the Australian Grand Prix, Prost appeared set to finish second in the Championship, behind Mansell. Prost had the same number of wins as Piquet, but he had four second places to Piquet's three, thus placing him second before the final race. While running third behind Piquet, and directly behind Prost on the road (3rd was all he needed to win the title), Mansell suffered a rear tyre failure at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and crashed out. The Williams team then pitted Piquet to change tyres as a safety precaution, while Prost had already pitted earlier due to a puncture and did not need to change his tyres again. He then held the lead ahead of a charging Piquet to the chequered flag and the Championship.[18] Prost became the first driver to retain the title since Jack Brabham in 1960.[28]\n\n\nAnother memorable race that year for Prost was at the San Marino Grand Prix. He was cruising to victory when his car began to run out of fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race.[29] Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself *\"shit, I am going to lose this race again\"*, referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola.[25] It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd.[30] The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.[31] Prost also finished sixth at the Belgian Grand Prix, where he collided with Gerhard Berger in the Benetton. As a result, the car's front suspension and engine mountings were bent, which badly affected its handling. It would behave one way in left hand corners and a completely different way in right hand corners. McLaren Technical Director John Barnard said afterwards that the car was \"bent like a banana\" upon the teams' post-race inspection of the car.[32]\n\n\n\n#### 1987[edit]\n\n\nWith Rosberg retiring from Formula One at the end of 1986 season, underrated Swede Stefan Johansson filled the McLaren seat alongside Prost for the 1987 season. Even though McLaren had introduced the new Steve Nichols designed MP4/3 after three seasons with the MP4/2 model (Barnard had departed for Ferrari), the TAG engines were not the force they had been previously, lagging behind in power and with unreliability previously unseen. He never gave up though and challenged Piquet and Mansell almost until the end, winning three races and breaking Jackie Stewart's record for race victories by winning for the 28th time at the Portuguese Grand Prix. \"People might not believe me,\" said Stewart at the time. \"But I'm glad to see Alain take my record. I am glad that he has done it because he's the one that deserves it. There is no doubt in my mind that he is the best race driver of his generation.\"[33][18] Prost considers his win in the opening round in Brazil as his best and most rewarding race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been dominant during qualifying, and Prost started fifth on the grid with a time three seconds slower than Mansell's pole time. Knowing he didn't have the qualifying speed, he instead worked on his race set-up, and with everyone else going for a high-downforce set-up, he went the other way. The set-up meant less tyre wear, thanks to slower speeds in the corners while going fast down the straights. With his car having less tyre wear than his rivals, Prost was able to get through the 61 laps of the abrasive Jacarepagu\u00e1 Circuit with only two stops compared to the three or more by his rivals (Piquet pitted for tyres 3 times within the first 40 laps). Prost finished 40 seconds in front of Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.\n\n\n\n\n> When you win a race like this the feeling is very, very good. There have been times when I have been flat-out to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In 1980 I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact the only thing you can judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.[34]\n> \n> \n\n\nProst finished the 1987 season in fourth place in the championship behind Piquet, Mansell and Lotus driver Ayrton Senna. Prost finished 30 points behind champion Nelson Piquet.[35] Other than his debut season in 1980 and 1991, it was the furthest away he would finish a season from the championship lead.[3]\n\n\nDespite a slightly disappointing 1987 season, nevertheless by the end of that year Prost had the honour of notching up his 4th consecutive No.1 driver of the year by the editor of the *Autocourse* annual, matching Niki Lauda's run of No.1's from 1975 to 1978 in the same annual. Writing in 1987, the *Autocourse* editor mentioned that despite driving a down on power engine (compared to the Honda's) \"Prost should have won at least 6 races in 1987 \u2013 but he won't moan about it. Despite being out of championship contention, 1987 was a memorable year for Prost. His win at Estoril was exceptional.\"[36] In 1985, the *Autocourse* editor wrote of Prost: \"In the long run, Ayrton Senna may be the better driver, but in 1985 for speed and consistency Prost had no equal\",[37] while in 1986, the *Autocourse* editor commented on Prost's season \"Alain had an almost faultless year. 1986 was a year of Prost's outstanding all round ability.\"[38]\n\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost driving for McLaren at the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix\nDespite Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Drivers' Championship and Williams winning the Constructors' Championship, Honda decided not to supply the team with their engines, reportedly due to Williams's refusal to dump Nigel Mansell and hire Japanese driver and Honda test driver Satoru Nakajima (who debuted with Lotus in 1987), and instead supplied the McLaren team for 1988.[39] Prost had convinced Ron Dennis to sign Ayrton Senna to a three-year contract,[40] which played a role in luring Honda (Senna's ability had been highly regarded by the Japanese giant when using their engines with Lotus in 1987 and both were keen to continue their association).[41] However, this began the rivalry that pushed two of the sport's greatest drivers to unprecedented heights of success and controversy. McLaren-Honda dominated the season, winning 15 out of 16 races. Prost finished first or second in every race other than his two retirements at Silverstone and Monza. He won seven races and in total outscored his new teammate Senna by 11 points, despite Senna winning one more race than him. However, only the 11 best results from the season counted toward the championship total, and this gave Senna the title by three points.[18] Prost went on to be a proponent of essentially the 1990s scoring system: all points counting toward the final results, with a race winner scoring 10 (rather than 9).[42]\n\n\nIn November of that year, Prost had a meeting with the head of Honda's R&D department and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and \"samurai\"-like driving. Senna had already developed a close relationship with the Honda engineers during the 1987 season when he was at Lotus. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.[43][40]\n\n\n\n#### 1989[edit]\n\n\nMcLaren's domination continued throughout 1989, and the struggle between Prost and Senna for supremacy put them on a collision course. Mutual admiration turned to all-out hatred, with Prost accusing Senna of \"dangerous driving\"[3] and of receiving more than a fair share of attention from both McLaren and Honda. For his part, Senna accused Prost of being in the pocket of FISA's French president Jean-Marie Balestre.[44] The animosity between the two drivers came to a head at Round 2 in San Marino. The drivers made an agreement between them that whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other going into the first turn (in this case, the Tosa bend on the Imola circuit). Prost kept to the agreement after Senna won the first start. Prost however won the restart (caused by Gerhard Berger's fiery crash in his Ferrari), but was passed by Senna under brakes for Tosa. Prost went to a friend of his, a French journalist, and told him about the broken agreement between him and Senna. Against Prost's wishes, the journalist went public with the story. During testing at Pembrey in Wales, Senna denied in public any such agreement had ever existed between Prost and himself, but Prost's claim was backed up by Marlboro's John Hogan who had been present when the agreement was made.[45]\n\n\nProst had the firm belief that Honda and Ron Dennis viewed Senna as the future of the team. Prost recalled that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one car with maybe four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him.[40] Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining Ferrari. Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments. However, Prost received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his 1990 teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not seem to work as well as was once normal. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if there was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. To the delight of the tifosi whose team he signed for the 1990 season, at the rostrum Prost dropped his driver's trophy into the crowd, to the anger of Dennis who since changed McLaren's policy requiring that all trophies won by drivers belong to the team. Dennis was in fact so incensed at Prost that he threw his constructor's trophy at Prost's feet on the rostrum. Prost had a replica trophy made for Dennis but it sat in a cupboard for over 6 years.[46][47]\n\n\nAs 1989 wore on, Prost continually claimed his Honda V10s were not producing the same amount of power as those in Senna's car. It actually got to the point where Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality).[48] Evidence to support Prost's claims was seen during the Mexican Grand Prix. His car was running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came off the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than Senna and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.[49]\n\n\nTheir embittered season ended as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix at the end of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casio Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path resulting in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of Senna's car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban.[50] Thus, Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances, later stating \"Ayrton Senna came behind me, I didn't see him come and I couldn't do anything to avoid him. I am very sorry to have to finish the championship on such an incident\".[51]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1990\u20131991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost practising for his first event for Ferrari, the 1990 United States Grand Prix\nProst signed to join Ferrari in 1990, becoming the first driver signed to the team after the death of team founder Enzo Ferrari in 1988. He replaced Gerhard Berger at Ferrari and was partnered with Britain's Nigel Mansell for 1990 (Berger took Prost's seat at McLaren). As reigning world champion, Prost took over as the team's lead driver and was said to have played on this status. Mansell recalls one incident where at the 1990 British Grand Prix, the car he drove didn't handle the same as in the previous race where he had taken pole position, and later found out from team mechanics that Prost saw Mansell as having a superior car and had them swapped without Mansell knowing.[52][53] Prost won five races for Ferrari that year, in Brazil, Mexico, France, Britain and Spain. Notable among these was the Mexican Grand Prix, where he won after starting in 13th position.[54] In both the Mexican and Spanish races, he led Mansell to Ferrari 1\u20132 finishes. The championship once again came to the penultimate round of the season in Japan with Prost trailing his McLaren adversary, Ayrton Senna, by nine points. As in 1989, a controversial collision between the two settled the race.[18] At the first corner Senna, as admitted a year later, intentionally drove his race car into Prost's, taking them both out of the race and sealing the title in his favour.[44] \"What he did was disgusting,\" Prost said. \"He is a man without value.\"[3] Prost finished the season seven points behind Senna, and his Ferrari team were runners-up to McLaren.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prost at the 1991 United States Grand Prix\nMansell left the Scuderia due to his unstable relationship with Prost,[56][53] to rejoin Williams for the 1991 Formula One season. Mansell's replacement was Frenchman Jean Alesi, who had been impressive during the previous two years at Tyrrell. Ferrari had entered a downturn, partially as their famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel efficient V10s of their competitors. The Ferrari chassis, despite a major revision by the French Grand Prix (F-643) was also not up to the level of the McLaren and the Williams models. Prost won no races, only getting onto the podium five times. He took this out on the team, publicly criticising the team and the Ferrari 643,[57] and subsequently had his contract terminated before the end of the season, immediately prior to the Australian Grand Prix.[58] He was replaced by Italian driver Gianni Morbidelli for the final race of the 1991 season and by another Italian, Ivan Capelli, for the following season. Despite being sacked, Prost received a significant payment from Ferrari to not drive for any other team.[59]\n\n\n\n### Williams (1993)[edit]\n\n\nProst went on a sabbatical year in 1992,[3] which was dominated by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team.[59] After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. Prost had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year.[60] Prost was part of a new-look driver line-up at Williams,[61] with test driver Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.[62]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of an F1 car being driven perpendicular to camera](image)\n![Blue Formula One car turning slightly.](image)\nProst driving his 1993 Williams-Renault FW15C at Silverstone (left) and Adelaide (right).\n\nProst won his fourth and final title in a year when he was regularly challenged by teammate Hill and by Ayrton Senna. Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, because the clause in his contract did not extend to 1994 and Senna would be able to join Williams for the upcoming season,[60] and instead opted to retire.[1] At the season's end Prost held the record for most Grand Prix victories,[63][3] a record that stood for almost a decade.[64] On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost was surprised by the gesture, as Senna had declined a handshake at the previous race.[40] Prost's performances earned him an OBE.[65][66]\n\n\nGerman Michael Schumacher broke Prost's record of 51 Grand Prix wins during the 2001 season.[64] He also shares the record for starting every race of a season from the front row (16, in 1993), with Ayrton Senna (1989) and Damon Hill (1996).[67] As of January 2023[update], he is the last Frenchman to have won his home Grand Prix.[68]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prost's helmet for the 1988 Formula One season\nProst used a helmet design based on the three colours of the French flag, blue, white and red, with his name along the side. During his early career Prost used a basic design of white all over with some blue detail around the visor (blue helmet with a white 180\u00b0 flipped Y and red lines in the lower branch of the flipped Y and in the upper branch, surrounding the top).[69] During Prost's time at Renault, he used more blue details, most notably around the rear of his helmet. Prost's helmet changed in 1985, as his helmet now had the blue detail around the front, surrounding the visor (with also a blue stripe on the side region, making the white area become a P) and a white ring with red lines surrounding the top (forming a white circle with a blue half in the rear of the top).[70] Prost kept a similar design for his entry at Ferrari and Williams.\nSometimes Prost used variants of his helmet design. In 2007 he used his original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white helmet with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe on the visor, designed by Kaos Design.[71]\n\n\n\n## Career legacy[edit]\n\n\nProst is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever Formula One drivers, and is considered by some to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[72] In 2009, an *Autosport* survey taken by 217 Formula One drivers saw Prost voted as the fourth greatest Formula One driver of all time.[73] In October 2020, *The Economist* ranked champion drivers by the relative importance of car quality to driver skill. According to this ranking, Prost is Formula One's third best driver of all time.[74] In November 2020, Carteret Analytics used quantitative analysis methods to rank Formula One drivers. According to this ranking, Prost is Formula One's eighth best driver of all time.[75] A 2022 mathematical analysis of all F1 drivers by f1-analysis.com put Prost as the 4th greatest driver of all time, and the second greatest once differences between different eras had been corrected for.[76] In November 2022, *Autosport* ranked Prost as the statistical fourth best driver of all time.[77]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry with Ayrton Senna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prost\u2013Senna rivalry\n\nProst's battles with Ayrton Senna were particularly notable. The rivalry originated in 1988, when Senna joined Prost at the McLaren team. The most notable event during the season between the two occurred during the Portuguese Grand Prix, where Senna tried to block Prost from taking the lead by forcing him to run close to the pit wall at around 280\u00a0km/h (174\u00a0mph). Prost managed to edge Senna outwards, taking the lead as they went into the first corner, but remained angered by Senna's manoeuvre.[78]\n\n\nThe rivalry intensified after the 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, where the two drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner (*cf.* 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in his way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, Prost got away the better of the two but Senna forced his way past him at the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement at the start of the race, leaving Prost furious.[45] Senna argued that it was the restart.[79] Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda,[40] so he announced in mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season. Prost mentioned many times during 1989 that he believed his car was not as competitive as Senna's, and even that this was confirmed to him by the CEO of Honda when Prost traveled to Japan. The information was actually confirmed during the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis said that Prost's car was consistently using more fuel, but not getting more power, than Senna's engine.[80]\n\n\nThe rivalry reached its peak at the end of 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at Suzuka. The two McLarens collided at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away while Senna returned to the track. Senna went on to win the race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, Senna received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading him to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favouring his compatriot Prost.[81]\n\n\nThe following season saw the two drivers collide again. With Senna leading Prost, now in a Ferrari, in the world Drivers' Championship, Prost qualified second for the penultimate race of the season in Suzuka with Senna on pole. Senna was apparently told by a Steward that the pole position would be on one side of the track but discovered before the race that it would be actually be on the other side. Senna complained that no longer being on the racing line, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip (and therefore a slower start) than Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. Senna's appeal was rejected.[82] At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two, but while braking for the first corner Senna did not brake and collided with Prost at 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), clinching the title for himself.[83] Prost almost retired from the sport, saying \"What he did was disgusting. He is a man without value.\"[3] A year later, Senna admitted that the move was premeditated, in retaliation for the collision at the chicane on the same course the previous year.[44]\n\n\nThere was another controversial incident in 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari was unable to put up a challenge regularly to Senna's front running McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very same point.[84] At the following race, in Hungary, the FISA ordered a sit-down meeting between the two men, not wanting any repeats of the incidents from the previous two years.[85]\n\n\nProst took a sabbatical in 1992 after being fired from Ferrari for publicly criticizing the car and the team,[86] and Senna struggled, because McLaren was no longer competitive with Williams. Prost announced his signing with Williams for the upcoming 1993 season. Senna too had wanted to join Williams, as they were the most competitive, but Prost had a clause in his contract excluding Senna as a teammate. An infuriated Senna called the Frenchman a \"coward\" during a press conference at Estoril, and decried his unwillingness to compete for the Drivers' Championship on equal sporting terms:\n\n\n\n\n> I think if Prost wants to be called the sole champion, three-times world champion, come back in a sportive way, maybe win another championship, he should be sportive. The way he's doing, he's behaving like a coward. And if he wants to be sportive, he must be prepared to race anybody, at any condition, at equal terms.[87]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the 1993 season, Prost and Senna continued their on-track rivalry. Prost was escorted by police to the Interlagos circuit for the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix due to the hostility of Brazilians towards him.[88] The two continued their on-track battles at Silverstone where Senna aggressively defended his position against Prost.[89] At Prost's last Grand Prix, the 1993 Australian Grand Prix, he was pulled up by Senna onto the top step of the podium for an embrace.[90][40]\n\n\nOn 1 May 1994, Ayrton Senna was killed during the San Marino Grand Prix. Prost was a pallbearer at his funeral.[91] Speaking four years after Senna's death, Prost told Nigel Roebuck that he had \"always refused to speak about him\". Prost stated that when Senna died \"a part of himself had died also\", because their careers had been so bound together.[40] Senna had also felt the same when Prost had retired at the end of 1993, when he admitted to a close friend that he had realised how much of his motivation had come from fighting with Prost. Only a couple of days before his death, when filming an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, he greeted Prost, by then a pundit on the channel: \"A special hello to my...to our dear friend, Alain. We all miss you Alain.\" Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment.[92][40]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nDuring 1994 and 1995, Prost worked as a specialist commentator (pundit) for the French TV channel TF1.[93] He also worked for Renault doing public relations and promotions.[94] Prost went back to his old team McLaren, working as a technical adviser;[3] he also completed L'\u00c9tape du Tour, an annual mass-participation bike ride that takes place on a stage of the Tour de France.[95]\n\n\n\n### Prost Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prost Grand Prix\n\nDuring 1989 Prost began to contemplate starting his own team, as his relationship with his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993.[96] By 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people had assumed that a Prost-Renault team would be formed. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olivier Panis driving for the Prost Grand Prix team at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix\nOn 13 February 1997, Prost bought the Ligier team from Flavio Briatore and renamed it \"Prost Grand Prix\".[97] The day after he bought the team, Prost signed a three-year deal with French car manufacturer Peugeot, who would supply the team with engines from 1998 until 2000.[97] For the team's first season, Prost kept one of Ligier's 1996 drivers, Olivier Panis, who had won the Monaco Grand Prix the previous year; Japanese driver Shinji Nakano was signed to partner Panis. The team raced with the Mugen-Honda engines used by Ligier the previous season, while the car was actually the originally intended Ligier JS45, but was renamed the Prost JS45. Things looked promising at the start of the season, as the team picked up two points on its Grand Prix debut in Australia when Olivier Panis finished fifth. The team scored a further 13 points before Panis broke his leg in an accident during the Canadian Grand Prix. He was replaced by Minardi's Jarno Trulli. From there, things started to go downhill slightly, the team scored only five points during Panis's recovery. He came back at the end of the season to race in the last three Grands Prix. Prost GP finished sixth in the Constructors' Championship in its first season, with 21 points.[98][99]\n\n\nProst became the president of Prost Grand Prix at the start of 1998. With Peugeot supplying the engines for Prost GP, Mugen-Honda decided to supply the Jordan team. Prost GP scored a single point during the season when Jarno Trulli finished sixth in Belgium.[99]\n\n\n1999 was a crucial year for Prost GP.[100] Prost hired John Barnard as a technical consultant,[97] Barnard's B3 Technologies company helping Loic Bigois with the design of the Prost AP02. Panis and Trulli agreed to stay on with the team for the season. The car was not a major concern but the Peugeot V10 engine proved to be heavy and unreliable.[99]\n\n\nPeugeot's final year as Prost's engine supplier in 2000 saw some optimism. Prost hired his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi to drive the lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one: the AP03 proved to be unreliable and ill handling. Things weren't helped when the drivers collided with each other in the Austrian Grand Prix. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.[97]\n\n\nIn 2001 Ferrari agreed to supply engines for the season.[97] The money ran out at the start of the 2002 season and Prost was out of business, leaving debts of around $30 million.[97]\n\n\n\n### Other roles[edit]\n\n\nDuring 2002, Prost spent time with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, finishing third in the *Granite \u2013 Mont Loz\u00e8re*.[101][102] The Frenchman raced in the Andros ice race series in 2003, finishing second in the championship behind Yvan Muller.[103][104] In 2003 and 2004, Prost took part in the \u00c9tape du Tour.[105] Prost also became an Ambassador for Uniroyal, a position he would keep until May 2006.[106][107] Prost continued to compete in the Andros Trophy, winning the title with Toyota in 2006/07, 2007/08[108] and with Dacia in 2011/2012.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\nFor the 2010 Formula One season, the Sporting Regulations were changed so that a former driver sits on the stewards' panel. Prost was the first such driver to take on this role, at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix.[113] Prost also took part in the Race of Champions in 2010, a race organised for legends of motor sport to compete in equal machinery.[114] In February 2012, Prost was named as Renault's new international ambassador, representing the company in sports demonstrations and at events organized or attended by Renault.[115] Prost has finished the Absa Cape Epic, an eight-day 700\u00a0km mountain bike race in South Africa, twice. He first completed the race in 2012 with partner Sebastien di Pasqua and then again in 2013, and started but did not finish the race in 2014.[116]\n\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Prost would join forces with Jean-Paul Driot's DAMS racing team to form e.dams, a team which would compete in the FIA Formula E Championship for electric racing cars from its commencement in September 2014.[117] In June 2014, the team announced that its initial driver line-up would consist of Nicolas Prost and S\u00e9bastien Buemi.[118] The team went on to win the inaugural Formula E teams championship.[119] In 2017, he was employed as a special adviser for the Renault Formula One Team.[120] Since July 2019, he took up a non-executive director role with Renault Sport. During the 1000th Formula One race, the 2019 Chinese Grand Prix, Prost had the honor of waving the chequered flag as Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the line to take his 75th career victory.[121] Prost continued in his role within Renault Formula One Team, renamed \"Alpine F1 Team\" in 2021, until January 2022, when his departure from the team was announced.[122]\n\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\nProst was married to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they divorced sometime later. They have two sons, Nicolas (born 18 August 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990).[123] Prost also has a daughter, Victoria, born in 1996 from his relationship with Bernadette Cottin.[124] From 2014 to 2018, Nicolas raced in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father.[125][126] Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his Renault team fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to Sainte-Croix, Switzerland, and shortly after to Yens, Switzerland. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost's house in France and burned his Mercedes-Benz and another one of his road cars.[8] They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to Nyon in the same country.[127][128] Through Nicolas, Prost has two grandsons named Kimi (born November 2015)[129][130] and Mika (born December 2020).[131] Through Sacha, he has another grandson named Liam\u00a0(born June 2018).[132]\n\n\nIn 1986, Prost was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by the French President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand;[8][27] he was promoted from Chevalier to Officier rank in 1993.[133][134] In addition, he was awarded an honorary British OBE in 1994,[66][65] and the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross in 1999.[135][136] He was also inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and the FIA Hall of Fame in 1999 and 2017 respectively.[137][138]\n\n\nProst speaks fluent French, English and Italian.[139]\n\n\n\n## Karting

Senna is one of three Formula One drivers from Brazil to win the World Championship and won 41 Grands Prix and 65 pole positions, with the latter being the record until 2006. He died in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, driving for the Williams team.\n\n\nSenna began his motorsport career in karting, moved up to open-wheel racing in 1981 and won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship. He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year, and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, the Williams-Renault combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the 1993 season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in 1994.\n\n\nSenna was recognised for his qualifying speed over one lap, and from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993 European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the Monaco Grand Prix, is the sixth-most successful driver of all time in terms of race wins and has won more races for McLaren than any other driver. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Alain Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna at the age of 3\nSenna was born at 2:35\u00a0a.m. (05:35 GMT) on Monday, 21 March 1960, in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, a neighbourhood of S\u00e3o Paulo.[2] The middle child of a wealthy Brazilian family, he was born to landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva; he had an older sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo.[3] He was left-handed.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Senna's mother was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, while his father was born to a Spanish mother (from T\u00edjola, Province of Almer\u00eda) and a Brazilian father from S\u00e3o Paulo.[5]\n\n\nThe house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged to Neide's father, Jo\u00e3o Senna. It was located on the corner of Avenida Aviador Guilherme with Avenida Gil Santos Dumont, less than 100 meters from Campo de Marte, a large area where they operated the Aeronautics Material park and an airport. Senna was highly athletic, excelling in gymnastics and other sports, and developed an interest in cars and motor racing at the age of four. However, as a small boy, he had poor motor coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was unremarkable (i.e. showed no abnormalities). Senna's parents nicknamed him \"Beco\".[6][*page\u00a0needed*] At the age of seven, Senna first learned to drive a Jeep around his family's farm and also how to change gears without using a clutch.[7]\n\n\nSenna attended Colegio Rio Branco in the S\u00e3o Paulo neighbourhood of Higien\u00f3polis and graduated in 1977 with a grade 5 in physics along with other grades in mathematics, chemistry, and English. He later enrolled in a college that specialised in business administration, but dropped out after three months.[8] Overall, his grades amounted up to 68%.[6][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna began racing go-karts in Brazil at the age of 13.\nSenna's first kart was built by his father using a small 1-HP lawnmower engine. Senna started racing at Interlagos and entered a karting competition at the age of 13.[9][*timestamp\u00a0needed*] He started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were some years older than him; despite this, he managed to lead most of the race before retiring after colliding with a rival. His father supported his son and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.[10][*timestamp\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nSenna went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. He contested the Karting World Championship each year from 1978 to 1982, finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980.[11] In 1978, he was the teammate of Terry Fullerton, from whom Senna later felt was the rival he got the most satisfaction racing against also because of the lack of money and politics at that level.[12]\n\n\nIn 1981, Senna moved to Eaton[13] near Norwich in England to begin single-seater racing, winning the RAC and Townsend Thoresen Formula Ford 1600 Championships that year with the Van Diemen team.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)21-year-old Senna in his British Formula Ford 1600 single seater\nDespite this, Senna initially did not believe he would continue in motorsport. At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil.[6][*page\u00a0needed*][14] Before leaving England, however, Senna was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for \u00a310,000. Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England. As da Silva is the most common Brazilian surname, he adopted his mother's maiden name, Senna.[15] Senna went on to win the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships.[16] For that season, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.[6][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Senna drove in the British Formula Three Championship for the West Surrey Racing team. He dominated the first half of the season until Martin Brundle, driving a similar car for Eddie Jordan Racing, closed the gap in the second part of the championship. Senna won the title at the final round after a closely fought and, at times, acrimonious battle with the Briton.[17] In November that year, Senna also triumphed at the inaugural Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix with Teddy Yip's Toyota-powered Theodore Racing Team.[18][19][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nSenna was managed for most of his career by Armando Teixeira, who was assisted by Domingo Piedade.[20]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Ayrton Senna\n\n### Toleman (1984)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna's Toleman TG184 from 1984 on display in the Donington Grand Prix Collection\nIn 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman. Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg.[21] Neither Williams or McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season.[21] Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) so that he would have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.\n\n\nPeter Warr actually wanted to replace Nigel Mansell with Senna at Lotus, but their British-based title sponsor, Imperial Tobacco (John Player & Sons), wanted a British driver. Senna, however, was determined to drive that season and certainly on his own terms. Senna's test for Brabham occurred at Circuit Paul Ricard in November 1983. Senna impressed the Brabham team and was linked to their second seat. However, the team's main sponsor, Italian dairy company Parmalat, wanted an Italian driver. Brabham's second car was eventually shared by brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi, while Piquet convinced Ecclestone to sign his friend Roberto Moreno as the test driver.[22][23]\nConsequently, Senna joined Toleman, a relatively new team, using less competitive Pirelli tyres.[24][25] Venezuelan Johnny Cecotto, a former Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion, was his teammate.[26]\nIn 1984, Senna hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition due to his concern over his low weight.[9]\n\n\nSenna made his debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro, where he qualified 17th, but retired when the Hart 415T turbocharger failed on lap 8.[27] He scored his first World Championship point when he finished 6th in his second race at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami with severe cramp in his neck and shoulders, and replicated that result two weeks later at the Belgian Grand Prix.[27][28]\n\n\nA combination of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in his failure to qualify for the San Marino Grand Prix, the only time this happened during his career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at Imola due to a dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli (Toleman were in the process of switching from Pirelli to Michelin). Senna then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid.[29] Senna's best result of the season came at the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, he made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing Niki Lauda for second on lap 19. He quickly began to cut the gap to race leader Alain Prost, but before he could attack Prost, the race was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the race was stopped, Senna was catching Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the Tyrrell-Ford of Stefan Bellof was catching both at the same rate, although he was later disqualified due to weight restrictions broken by Tyrrell).[30]\n\n\n\nSenna was renowned throughout his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long before the advent of telemetry; this skill led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the Dallas Grand Prix in the United States as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of Monaco. Symonds recalled in an interview:[31]\n\n\n> The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race, but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish, but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said \"I'm sure that the wall moved!\" And even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him after the race to have a look at the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit, the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened \u2013 we could see it from the tyre marks \u2013 was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.\n> \n> \n\nThat season, Senna took two more podium finishes\u2014third at the British and Portuguese Grands Prix\u2014and placed 9th in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points overall. He did not take part in the Italian Grand Prix after he was suspended by Toleman for being in breach of his contract by entering talks with Lotus for 1985 without informing the Toleman team first. Although Senna did have a \u00a3100,000 buyout clause in his contract, the team had to be informed before discussions with another team started.[32][33] Senna became the first driver Lotus had signed not personally chosen by team founder Colin Chapman, who had died in 1982.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the end of the year, Senna had developed Bell's palsy, possibly from a virus. One side of his face had become completely paralysed; Sid Watkins gave Senna steroids to preserve the possibility of recovery.[34]\n\n\n\n### Lotus (1985\u20131987)[edit]\n\n\n1985\n![](image)Senna driving the Team Lotus 97T at the 1985 European Grand Prix\nSenna was partnered in his first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis. He had dominated testing times at Rio, although he retired with electrical issues during the race weekend. Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the car was unreliable and Senna made a few mistakes out of inexperience. At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career. He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from Michele Alboreto[35] in the Ferrari and lapping everyone up to and including 3rd placed Patrick Tambay. The race was the first 'Grand Slam' of Senna's career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race. He would later argue it was the best drive of his career,[36] an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised Senna's \"truly special\" talent.[37]\n\n\nSenna led at the San Marino, Monaco, British and German Grands Prix but retired from all these races either from engine failure or running out of fuel, and he had a huge accident at the French Grand Prix at the Circuit Paul Ricard's fastest corner after an engine failure in the middle of the corner. He did not finish in the points again until coming second at the Austrian Grand Prix, despite taking pole three more times in the intervening period. (His determination to take pole at the Monaco Grand Prix had infuriated Alboreto and Niki Lauda; Senna had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately baulking the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge he rejected, though the accusations continued in Canada when drivers accused him of running on the racing line when on his slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time).[38] Two more podiums followed in the Netherlands and Italy, before Senna added his second victory in wet-dry conditions, at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium.[39] Senna's relationship with De Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus and, after spending six years at the team, De Angelis departed for Brabham at the end of the year, convinced that Lotus were becoming focused around the Brazilian driver.[40] Senna and De Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points. In terms of qualifying, however, Senna had begun to establish himself as the quickest in the field: his tally of seven poles that season was far more than that of any of the other drivers (Renault's V6 qualifying engines were reported to be producing over 1,000\u00a0bhp (746\u00a0kW; 1,014\u00a0PS)).[41]\n\n\n\n1986\n![](image)Senna driving the Lotus 98T at the 1986 British Grand Prix\nDe Angelis was replaced at Lotus by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver, which led to the signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted \"It was bad, bad. Until then I had a good relationship with Derek.\"[42] Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races.[43] Although the 98T was like the 97T which came before it, a quick car with superiority on tight, bumpy circuits but plagued with poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season it saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points. The 1986 F1 cars were the most powerful cars in history, with Senna's 98T producing over 1,300\u00a0bhp (969\u00a0kW; 1,318\u00a0PS) in qualifying and 850\u00a0bhp (634\u00a0kW; 862\u00a0PS) in the race.[44]\n\n\nAfter winning the Detroit Grand Prix from Frenchmen Prost and Jacques Laffite\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009which took place one day after Brazil was eliminated from the 1986 FIFA World Cup by France\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009Senna asked a trackside supporter for the Brazilian flag and he drove one lap waving it. Thereafter, he repeated this ritual every time he won a race. During an interview on American television, he used English curse words to express his frustration at having to go into the pits earlier than expected due to a deflating rear tire.[12] Senna also had a brief foray into rallying when he was invited by British magazine *Cars & Car Conversions* to try out a Vauxhall Nova, an MG Metro 6R4, a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and a Ford Escort on a stretch of land closed to the public.[45][46]\n\n\n\n1987\n![](image)The Lotus 99T raced by Senna in 1987\nTeam Lotus had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda. The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment.[47] Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an irate Mansell grabbed Senna by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics.[48][49] Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of his record six victories at the Principality) and the Detroit Grand Prix, his second victory in two years at the angular Michigan street circuit[50] and the first ever for an active suspension F1 car.[51]\n\n\nAs the championship progressed, however, it became evident that the Williams cars had the advantage over the rest of the field, the gap between the Honda-engined teams made most obvious at the British Grand Prix, where Mansell and Piquet in the superior Williams cars lapped the Lotuses of Senna and Nakajima who finished 3rd and 4th respectively. Senna became dissatisfied with his chances at Lotus and at Monza it was announced that he would be joining McLaren for 1988.[52] Senna was fined $15,000 for punching a corner marshal after they refused to push his stalled car in Mexico then finished the season strongly, coming second in the final two races in Japan and Australia, however post-race scrutineering at the final race found the brake ducts of his Lotus to be wider than permitted by the rules and he was disqualified, bringing his last and most successful season with Lotus to a sour end.[53] Senna was classified third in the final standings, with 57 points, six podium finishes and only one pole position. This season marked a turning point in Senna's career as, throughout the year, he built a deep relationship with Honda, which paid big dividends, as McLaren had secured Williams's supply of Honda's V6 turbo engines for 1988.[54]\n\n\n\n### McLaren (1988\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won his first world title in 1988 driving that season's dominant McLaren MP4/4.\nIn 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team.[55] The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years.[56] However, the experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton and Lotus.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Honda RA168E engine, which powered Senna to his first world championship\nOne notable incident of the year was at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Senna out-qualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67.[57] Instead of returning to the pit lane, Senna was so distressed by his mistake that he went back to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. After team manager Jo Ramirez called him through his Monaco apartment's cleaner hours after he had crashed, Senna was still devastated by his own mistake. As the television cameras had not captured his crash, team boss Ron Dennis did not know what had caused his DNF until then, though Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though Senna had clipped the inside barrier at Portier, which pitched him into the outside guard rail. At the Portuguese Grand Prix, Prost made a slightly faster start than Senna, but the Brazilian, as he would a number of times, dived into the fast first corner ahead. Prost responded and went to pass Senna at the end of the first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at 290\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph). Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away. Prost, normally a calm individual, was angered by Senna's manoeuvre, and the Brazilian got away with a warning from the FIA. At the post-race team debrief, Prost voiced his anger at the move which prompted Senna to apologize to Prost for the incident. Ultimately, the pair won 15 of 16 races in the dominant McLaren MP4/4 in 1988 with Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to Prost's seven. Prost scored more points over the season, but three of his second places were dropped, as only the 11 best scores counted, meaning that Senna bested Prost by three points.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alain Prost and victor Ayrton Senna at Grand Prix Molson du Canada at Montreal, Canada, in 1988\nHowever, the biggest incident of the year happened at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, who were closing in on the McLaren (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo chicane, Senna closed on the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for the unwell Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap, and the two collided; Senna's car was beached on top of a curb and had stalled. Ferrari went on to finish 1\u20132, the first in an Italian Grand Prix since the death of the team's founder Enzo Ferrari. This proved to be the only race McLaren did not win in 1988.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring the season, Senna rewrote the record books. His eight wins beat the old record of seven jointly held by Jim Clark (1963) and Prost (1984). His 13 pole positions also beat the record of nine held by Nelson Piquet (1984).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### 1989[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna driving the McLaren MP4/5 in 1989\nThe following year, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it.[59][*page\u00a0needed*] Some controversy also arose after the French GP press conference when Ron Dennis declared that they found consistent differences between the Honda engines from Prost and Senna, to the detriment of Prost.[60] Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the San Marino Grand Prix, a move which Prost claimed violated a pre-race agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, though Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of the team's major sponsor, Marlboro). A discussion between the two drivers and Dennis during a test session at the Pembrey circuit in Wales served to effectively confirm Senna and Prost's personal animosity to Dennis and the team. Senna took an early lead in the championship with victories in San Marino, Monaco, and Mexico. Senna also led every lap of those races, a feat unequalled until Sebastian Vettel replicated it in 2012.[61] Senna also managed to win in Germany, Belgium, and Spain. However, unreliability in four consecutive races in Phoenix, Canada, France and Britain, and further unreliability in Italy, together with collisions in Brazil and Portugal, swung the title in Prost's favour.[62]\n\n\nProst took the 1989 world title after a collision with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the gurney flap from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna.[63] This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners\u2014a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the tight last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini and went on to claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which was not part of the track.[64][65] A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in public criticism of the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made.[66] Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place. Prost, who could not stand working with Senna in what he felt was a hostile environment, left McLaren for rivals Ferrari the following year. Prost had burned bridges even with Ron Dennis after a trophy-related incident in Italy.[67]\n\n\n\n#### 1990[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The McLaren MP4/5B raced by Senna in 1990\nIn 1990, Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second-places, and three thirds. With Prost gone to Ferrari, he also had a new teammate in Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger. Among his victories were the opening round on the wide streets of Phoenix, in which he diced for the lead for several laps with Jean Alesi's Tyrrell before coming out on top, and in Germany, where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. Senna won six races, including another Monaco win, and as the season reached its final quarter, however, Prost in his Ferrari rose to the challenge with five wins, including a crucial victory in Spain where he and teammate Nigel Mansell finished 1\u20132 for the Scuderia. Senna had gone out with a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost was now reduced to nine points with two races left.[68]\n\n\nAs part of Japanese publisher Shueisha's sponsorship of McLaren, Senna collaborated with Akira Toriyama, the creator of *Dragon Ball*, on artwork for *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* featuring McLaren-themed illustrations of *Dragon Ball* characters. Senna was also featured in *GP Boy*, a two-volume manga published in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* to commemorate Shueisha's sponsorship.[69][70]\n\n\nAt the penultimate round of the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack, but after qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton,[71] the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would not have been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) and went off the track, went through the gravel trap and slammed into the tire barrier, making Senna world champion.[72][73]\n\n\nFollowing the second championship-deciding collision in two years, Jackie Stewart interviewed Senna at the subsequent race in Australia (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble forced him to slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved over the last few years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers in the last four years than all the champions before him. An irritated Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions like he did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced and famously said: \"Being a racing driver means you are racing with other people, and if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver.\"[74]\n\n\nA year later, after taking his third world championship, Senna admitted that he had deliberately crashed into Prost at the previous year's Japanese Grand Prix, and he then explained to the press his actions and motives at Suzuka that year. He maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, he had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the track (where the racing line was), only to find this decision reversed after he had taken pole.[75] Senna said that he was not going to accept what he saw as unfair decision-making by the FIA, including his 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990.[76] Senna stated that no matter what happened, he would not yield the corner and that Prost taking his normal racing line would result in an accident. Prost later went on record criticising Senna's actions as \"disgusting\", saying that he seriously considered retiring from the sport after that incident. During an interview with Eurosport at the Australian Grand Prix Prost revealed that he had seen the Honda engine telemetry at Suzuka and that it showed that Senna had kept his foot absolutely flat through the 4th gear corner when he had hit Prost\u200a\u2014\u200aSenna had not even taken his foot off the accelerator to change down to 4th for this corner, strongly intimating that Senna had taken Prost out on purpose.[55]\n\n\n\n#### 1991[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the season-opening United States GP with the new Honda V12-powered MP4/6.\nIn 1991, Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10.[77] Senna won the first four races in Phoenix, Brazil, Imola and Monaco as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge later in the season, having only scored six points by the time Senna had 40 points. Before the Mexican Grand Prix, Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near S\u00e3o Paulo for which he required stitches on the back of his head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier.[78] At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled over on his parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. Senna then had an enormous accident during testing at the very fast Hockenheim circuit in Germany where his car flew 15 feet into the air after a tyre failure, and turned over several times upon coming down onto the track. The car was destroyed and Senna had to spend the night in hospital in nearby Mannheim. While still able to compete in the German Grand Prix at the Hockenheim circuit soon thereafter, at that event Senna ran out of fuel mere laps before the end. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThough Senna's consistency, the car's competitiveness, and the Williams' unreliability at the beginning of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the MP4/6 before it was too late. These modifications, including modifications introduced at Hungary and variable inlet trumpets introduced at Belgium enabled him to make a late-season push, and he won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in Japan when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season.[79] Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty; in addition to Alain Prost's recommendation, Honda had played an important part in bringing Senna with them to McLaren.[80][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nThat year, as had been the case in 1988 and 1990, Senna won the \"International Racing Driver Award\" granted by British magazine *Autosport* annually. The award was presented by Stirling Moss and Senna was interviewed on stage by Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker. During the interview, Senna confirmed that at the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) gala dinner in Paris the day before, under the auspices of Jackie Stewart, Senna had given one of his helmets to his renowned foe, Jean-Marie Balestre, because of the sincere atmosphere that presented itself and as an insulting psychological gesture.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 1992[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix in his McLaren MP4/7A.\nIn 1992, Senna's determination to win manifested itself in dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car.[82] The FW14B, thanks in part to its aerodynamic-enhancing active suspension and powerful Renault V10 engine was much faster than any other car that season. McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new MP4/7A model running (it was McLaren's first car with a semi-automatic gearbox and it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit.[83] During practice for the second race of the season in Mexico on a badly maintained and extremely bumpy circuit Senna and other drivers were heavily critical of, his car hit a bump at one of the circuit's Esses corners that caused a loss of downforce and a hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. Senna had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors while wearing a neck brace; although he raced the next day, he had to retire from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year. During qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, French driver \u00c9rik Comas crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. Senna could hear the stricken car's engine revving at max RPM, and he exited his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman and shut off the car's screaming engine (which could have blown and started a fire at any moment), disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later visited Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from within Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher.[84][85]\n\n\nSenna's relationship with German rising star Michael Schumacher, who was showing exceptional form at every race was never a good one, possibly because Senna saw Schumacher as a threat to his supremacy in F1. At the 1992 Brazilian Grand Prix, Schumacher accused Senna of \"playing around\" while attempting to overtake Senna, who had a problem with his engine--a fact that Schumacher was apparently unaware of at the time. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher collided with Senna, resulting in Senna's retirement. Senna later confronted Schumacher, who admitted responsibility for the accident. At a test session for the German Grand Prix, Senna and Schumacher had a confrontation in the pits, with Senna grabbing Schumacher by the collar and accusing him of endangering him by blocking him on the track.[86]\n\n\nQuestions about Senna's intentions for the upcoming 1993 season lingered throughout 1992, as he did not have a contract with any team by the end of that year. Ferrari had offered him a contract which Senna discussed with Niki Lauda, but decided to decline the offer.[87] He felt the McLaren cars were becoming less competitive than in previous years, especially given Honda's decision to abandon the sport at the end of 1992 due to economic issues and McLaren's lack of active suspension relating to rival Williams.[88]\n\n\nGiven this scenario, Senna secured an IndyCar testing session with the support of compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi. In December 1992, in fact, Senna visited Firebird International Raceway in Chandler, Arizona near Phoenix in the United States[89] to test a 1992 Penske PC-21 CART Indianapolis car.[90] Unlike the more advanced F1 cars, this IndyCar was powered by a turbo Chevrolet-Ilmor V8, had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to its bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula One car; IndyCar teams were run with significantly smaller budgets than F1 teams and did not have to make their own cars. To familiarise himself, Senna initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which he later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 Penske PC-22 at his disposal during this test session.[91] In a 2018 interview, Fittipaldi revealed that Penske boss Roger Penske was ready to enter a third car for Senna to drive at the 1993 Indianapolis 500 - one of the most prestigious and important races in the world and a race that defending champion Mansell was competing at (who had left F1 for CART) - but when McLaren boss Ron Dennis found out it was a very serious deal he promptly banned Senna from competing at Indianapolis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 1993[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the 1993 European Grand Prix in changing conditions, in what many considered one of the best drives of his career.\nFor 1993, attempts were made by McLaren boss Ron Dennis to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines that Williams had found great success with. When these failed, Senna went to Williams himself and sought to take one of their two open rides, as defending champion Nigel Mansell joined the IndyCar Series for 1993 and longtime second driver Riccardo Patrese left to drive at Benetton alongside Michael Schumacher. However, despite Senna going so far as to be willing to forfeit his annual salary just to drive one of Williams' Renaults, this too would fail. Alain Prost was returning to F1 for the first time since the penultimate race of the 1991 season (he had been fired by Ferrari prior to the end of 1991, received a massive severance package as part of a non-compete clause, and took leave for the 1992 season) and filled one of the vacant Williams seats. His contract included a caveat that he had veto power over who he would team with in the other car for 1993; since he still had ill will toward his former McLaren teammate, Prost used that veto to freeze out Senna and force him into what was now a lame-duck season at McLaren.[93] Faced with this, during the post-race press conference of the 1992 Portuguese Grand Prix at the Estoril Circuit, an infuriated Senna called Prost a coward,[94] leading to some commentators stating that what Prost had done was no different from Senna vetoing Derek Warwick from joining Lotus in 1986, but they did not take into account that Senna's chances of winning the championship were much higher in 1993.[95][96]\n\n\nBy this time, McLaren was forced to take a customer supply of Ford V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, Benetton.[97] McLaren hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system \u2013 though the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate Michael Andretti.[98] With this plan, Dennis finally persuaded Senna to stay with McLaren. The Brazilian, however, agreed to do so only for the first race in South Africa, where he would assess whether McLaren's equipment was competitive enough for him to put in a good season. After driving McLaren's 1993 car, the McLaren MP4/8, Senna concluded it had surprising potential, albeit with a Ford V8 engine down on power relative to Prost's Renault V10 and less so on the Benetton's factory V8.[99] Senna thus extended his deal with McLaren on a race-by-race basis instead of a full-year contract, ending up staying for the whole of 1993 in any event.[100] Reportedly, this engagement was on a $1 million per race basis,[101] and, despite midseason testing with a Lamborghini V12 proving encouraging, with McLaren then signing an engine supply deal with Peugeot for the 1994 season, it all proved insufficient to continue to retain Senna past 1993.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna came from the back of the field to finish fourth at the 1993 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in his McLaren MP4/8.\nIn the opening race in South Africa, Senna finished in second place after surviving a collision with Schumacher.[102] Senna won in changing conditions in Brazil and Donington. The latter has often been regarded as one of Senna's greatest victories,[103] in the process setting a record for the fastest lap in an F1 race driving through the then speed-unrestricted pit lane. In cold, wet, rainy conditions typical of England in April he was fifth at the first corner and led the race at the end of the first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for rain or slick tyres.[104][105] Senna then scored a second-place finish in Spain and a record-breaking sixth win at Monaco, breaking Graham Hill's record of five.[106] After Monaco, the sixth race of the season, Senna unexpectedly led the championship from Prost in the Williams-Renault.[107] As the season progressed, Alain Prost and Damon Hill asserted the superiority of their Williams-Renault cars, while Senna suffered mechanical failures in Imola, Canada, Britain, Hungary, and Portugal, where Prost took his 4th world championship, losing apparently none of the skill he was not able to use during his 1992 sabbatical. Senna won the penultimate race of the season in Japan, which was marked by an incident involving Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine, twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the race, Senna angrily stormed into the Jordan team's garage and said to the Irishman \"You're driving like a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot! You're not a racing driver, you're a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot!\u201d before punching him in the side of the head.[108] Following that incident, the stewards gave Senna a two race suspended ban for 1994. However, after a discussion between Senna and the president of the FIA, a compromise was reached by removing the ban, considering the exemplary attitude of Senna towards his fellow drivers.[109] The decision created some polemic back at the time, both amongst drivers and in the press, considering that during the entirety of the 1993 season, Prost was under threat of a four-race ban for using words to criticize the president of the FIA, thus seemingly implying that punching a fellow driver in the face was viewed as a lesser transgression than criticizing the FIA.[110]\n\n\nThe season concluded in Australia, with Senna's 41st and last F1 career win, as well as the last win for an active-suspension F1 car (ironically, Senna had the first victory for a car with this technology in Monaco 1987). The win in Adelaide was an emotional one due to Senna ending his successful career with McLaren and defeating his biggest rival, Prost, for the last time. Because of the Frenchman's imminent retirement from the sport, Senna surprised the F1 community by openly welcoming Prost on the top step of the podium, which many considered a sign of pacification between the duo. Overall, Senna finished the championship second to Prost.[98][111]\n\n\n\n### Williams (1994)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Williams FW16 was the last F1 car raced by Senna.\nFor 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired[112] and was reportedly paid a $20\u00a0million salary.[113] Senna was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost, who would have been assigned number 1 had he returned, retiring. With Senna's arrival, a new sponsor came as well. Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for Williams, with Senna being one of their first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRule changes for 1994 had banned active suspension, traction control, and ABS. During preseason testing, the new Williams FW16 car exhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C and FW14B cars that preceded it, and Senna found himself in close running with the Benetton B194 of Michael Schumacher. Senna expressed his discomfort with the handling of his car, stating, \"I have a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on\u00a0... Some of that is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the car has its own characteristics which I'm not fully confident in yet.\"[114] Senna further added, \"It's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen.\"[115]\n\n\nThe first race of the season was at Interlagos in Brazil, where Senna took pole position. He took an early lead, but Schumacher's Benetton was never far behind. Schumacher took the race lead after passing Senna in the pits. While trying for a win, he pushed too hard and spun the car coming out of Jun\u00e7\u00e3o corner on lap 56, stalling it and retiring from the race.[112] The second race was the inaugural Pacific Grand Prix at Aida, where Senna again placed the car on the pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by second-qualifier Schumacher, he was hit from behind in the first corner by Mika H\u00e4kkinen and his race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini T-boned the Williams. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage. Hill also retired with transmission problems, while Schumacher took the victory again.[116]\n\n\nIt was Senna's worst start to a Formula One season, failing to finish or score points in the first two races, despite taking pole position both times. Schumacher was leading Senna in the Drivers' Championship by 20 points.[117] On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo revealed that, on 27 April 1994, he had held discussions at his home in Bologna with Senna about a future Ferrari engagement.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Season controversies and end[edit]\n\n\nThe 1994 season was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic \"driver aids\" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control. From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled Senna. For example, instead of returning to the pit area after his first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the race to see if he could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used.[119] He returned to the Williams pits after the race, suspicious that the Benetton car was illegal.[120] Indeed, in an interview for the 20th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death, his then-teammate, Damon Hill, revealed that Senna had \"concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine\" with \"special tweak\" giving Benetton an advantage.[121]\n\n\nThe season ended at the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, where the first-corner chicane at the Adelaide Street Circuit was renamed the \"Senna Chicane\". Schumacher went on to win the driver's world championship title controversially after a collision that forced his retirement and that of his rival, and Senna's teammate, Damon Hill. At the official FIA conference after the race, the German dedicated his title to Senna.[122]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Death of Ayrton Senna and 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\n\nThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April and 1 May 1994. The European leg of the F1 season, starting at Imola, was traditionally considered the beginning of the yearly competition. Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title.[123] Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling. During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello was involved in a serious accident when his car became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event. Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness.[124]\n\n\nDuring Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford broke entering the 310\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) Villeneuve corner, sending the car into the concrete retaining wall at high speed. Senna immediately visited the accident scene and medical centre. There he was met by FIA Medical Chief Professor Sid Watkins, who suggested to a tearful Senna that he should retire from racing and take up fishing (a hobby they both shared), to which Senna replied that he could not stop racing.[125] Senna was later called in front of the stewards for commandeering an official car and climbing the medical centre fence, and a row ensued, although Senna was not punished.[126] Senna spent his final morning on Sunday talking to former teammate and rival Alain Prost to discuss the re-establishment of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, a driver's union, with the aim of improving safety in Formula One. Prost had retired from the sport at the end of the 1993 season and was now a media presenter. As the most senior driver in competition, Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting from the next race in Monaco. During the drivers' briefing, concerns had been raised about the mainly promotional use of a Porsche 911 lead car for the warm-up lap, with organizers agreeing to abandon the practice.[126]\n\n\nAt the start of the Grand Prix, Senna retained the lead from his chief rival Michael Schumacher, but proceedings were soon interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. However, the Vectra's lack of speed proved detrimental to the racers, as the slower pace allowed the tyres of the Formula One cars to cool, thus decreasing their pressure. Senna pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, Max Angelelli,[127] to increase his speed.[128] On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace, completing the third-fastest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around 307\u00a0km/h (191\u00a0mph), ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around 233\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of the accident. Within two minutes of crashing, Senna was extracted from his race car by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. The initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss from his temporal artery being ruptured. At this point, Senna had already lost around 4.5 litres of blood, constituting 90% of his blood volume. Because of Senna's grave neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt 18:40 (16:40 GMT), the head of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandri[129] made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17 (12:17 GMT), which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped functioning.[126] Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.[12] The right-front wheel and suspension are believed to have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna on the right side of his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. A piece of upright attached to the wheel had partially penetrated his helmet and made a large indentation in his forehead. In addition, it appeared that a jagged piece of the upright assembly had penetrated the helmet visor just above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery, a major blood vessel supplying the face and scalp. According to Fiandri, any one of these three injuries would likely have killed him.[130][131]\n\n\nIt was later revealed that when the medical staff examined Senna's vehicle, a furled Austrian flag was discovered\u2014he had intended to raise it in honour of Ratzenberger after the race.[132] Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel were taken by Senna's friend and *Autosprint*'s picture editor, Angelo Orsi. Out of respect, those photographs have never been made officially public.[126]\n\n\n\n### Funeral[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAyrton Senna's resting place at the Morumbi cemetery in S\u00e3o Paulo, with an inscription in Portuguese that reads *\"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\"*\n\nSenna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the coffin back to Brazil, but the Senna family wished that it return home in a Brazilian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. The plane was escorted by fighter jets into S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport on 4 May 1994, where it was met by the Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Paulo Maluf, and the state's governor, Luiz Ant\u00f4nio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile (32.2\u00a0km) journey into the city. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.[133]\n\n\nOver half a million people flocked to the streets of Senna's home city of S\u00e3o Paulo to offer him their salute, the largest funeral procession Sao Paulo had ever seen.[134] Over 200,000 people filed past as his body lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in Ibirapuera Park. After the public viewing, a 21-gun salute was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven Brazilian Air Force jets flew in a diamond formation as the funeral procession made its way to Morumbi Cemetery. Many prominent motor-racing figures attended Senna's state funeral, which took place on 5 May, such as team managers Ken Tyrrell, Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart. The pallbearers included drivers: Gerhard Berger, Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost, Thierry Boutsen, Damon Hill, Rubens Barrichello, Roberto Moreno, Derek Warwick, Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin, Hans Stuck, Johnny Herbert, Pedro Lamy, Maurizio Sala, Raul Boesel, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, and Christian Fittipaldi. Neither Sid Watkins nor Jo Ram\u00edrez, the McLaren team coordinator, could bear to attend because they were so grief-stricken. Senna's family did not allow FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's, to attend the ceremony, after an altercation between Ecclestone and Senna's brother Leonardo at Imola regarding Ecclestone's misconstrued reaction to the news of Ayrton's death and the fact that the race had not been abandoned after his accident.[135] FIA President Max Mosley instead attended the funeral of Ratzenberger on 7 May, in Salzburg, Austria.[136] Mosley said in a press conference 10 years later, \"I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his.\"[137] Senna's grave bears the epitaph \"Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus\", which means \"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\" (a reference to Romans 8:38\u201339).[138]\n\n\nA testament to the adulation he inspired among fans worldwide was the scene at the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where McLaren-Honda cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received, they overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby.[139] This was despite the fact Senna no longer drove for a Honda-powered team. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda[140][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] and was beloved in Japan, where he achieved a near-mythic status.[141] For the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger.[142]\n\n\n\n### Italian prosecution[edit]\n\n\nItalian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended forthwith. Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter. The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.[143] This prosecution culminated with verdict no. 15050 handed down by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on 13 April 2007, which stated: \"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control\". Head, however, was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.[144]\n\n\nThe criminal charges focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed, causing the accident, and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was no time to manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.[145]\n\n\n\n## Motorsport career outside Formula One[edit]\n\n\nSenna did not participate in many other forms of motorsport once he reached Formula One.\n\n\n\n![](image)Senna won the saloon exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new N\u00fcrburgring in 1984.He took part in the 1984 N\u00fcrburgring Race of Champions, an exhibition race where all drivers competed in identical examples of the then-new Mercedes 190E 2.3\u201316 with minor race modifications. The race was held on the then newly-opened N\u00fcrburgring GP Track, before the European Grand Prix. Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula 1 drivers, including Stirling Moss and past World Champions Jack Brabham, Denny Hulme and Alan Jones, driving identical touring cars. Alain Prost started from pole position, but Senna took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning the race ahead of Niki Lauda and Carlos Reutemann.[146] After the race, Senna was quoted as saying, \"Now I know I can do it.\"[147] Senna was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race, taking over from Emerson Fittipaldi.\n\n\nIn 1984 he also took part in the N\u00fcrburgring round of the 1984 World Sportscar Championship, driving a Porsche 956 for New-Man Joest Racing, alongside Henri Pescarolo and Stefan Johansson.[20] He finished in 8th place but impressed the team and his co-drivers.\n\n\nHe took part in the Masters Karting Paris Bercy event in 1993, an indoor karting competition held on a temporary circuit at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. This event is notable for being the stage for the last on-track duel between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna at home in his native Brazil\nSenna was a devout Catholic once saying: \"Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune. It doesn't mean that I'm immortal\".[148] He often read the Bible on long flights from S\u00e3o Paulo to Europe.[149][150] According to his sister, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: \"On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself.\"[148]\n\n\nAs his profile rose, Senna expressed concern over the poor in Brazil. After his death, he was discovered to have secretly donated millions of dollars to help poor children.[151] Shortly before his death, he created the framework for an organisation dedicated to Brazilian children, which later became the Instituto Ayrton Senna (IAS).[152]\n\n\nSenna was awarded the No. 1 driver of the year by the editor of the Autocourse annual 3 times, in 1988, 1991, and 1993, as well as taking the runner-up spot in 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1992. However, Senna was so outraged by the editor dropping him from No. 1 to No. 2 in the 1990 listings as a result of Senna's first corner crash at Suzuka in 1990 with Alain Prost\u2014a piece of driving the editor considered completely reckless\u2014that despite being given the No. 1 driver award in 1991, Senna refused to write the usually customary foreword by the year's World Champion; Honda's Head of Racing wrote the foreword instead. The Autocourse editor wrote in 1993 that Senna had \"intense egocentricity and uniquely flawed genius\" and \"matchless genius in the wet\".[153] In the 2000 edition of Autocourse celebrating 50 years of Formula 1, the editor acknowledged that \"Senna was the one driver who genuinely cared where he was ranked in the Top 10 drivers by the AUTOCOURSE editorial\" and that Senna took being placed below his rivals as a personal slight.[154]\n\n\nSenna was often quoted as using driving as a means for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life, saying, \"The harder I push, the more I find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations, and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation.\"[155]\n\n\nTowards the end of his career, Senna became increasingly preoccupied with the dangers of his profession. On the morning of his death, he initiated the reformation of the GPDA safety organisation, with which he had intended to work to improve the safety of his sport.[156]\n\n\nSenna owned several properties, including an organic farm in Tatu\u00ed, Brazil (where he built a go-kart track in 1991), a beach house in Angra dos Reis, Brazil, an apartment in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, an apartment in Monaco, an estate in Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera, and a house in Algarve, Portugal.[157]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSenna's own \"BAe-125\" private jet (top) in Faro, Portugal with registration N125AS, AS standing for his initials, and passing time with a model plane (bottom)\n\nSenna enjoyed a range of physical activities including running, waterskiing, jet skiing, and paddleboarding. He also had several hobbies, such as flying real and model planes and helicopters,[158] boating, fishing, and riding his favourite Ducati motorbikes. His private jet was a British Aerospace 125, and he also piloted his own helicopter between his residences in Brazil along with travelling to races.[159] For his 29th birthday in 1989, the Brazilian Air Force gave Senna a flight on one of their jet fighters (a Dassault Mirage III), which bears commemorative livery and is now exhibited at the Aerospace Museum of Rio de Janeiro.[160] After a 3 ship flyover of the type at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix, Senna was given a joyride in an RAAF F-111C[161]\n\n\nSenna was close friends with McLaren teammate Gerhard Berger, and the two were always playing practical jokes on each other.[162] Berger is quoted as saying, \"He taught me a lot about our sport, I taught him to laugh.\"[163] In the documentary film *The Right to Win*, made in 2004 as a tribute to Senna, Frank Williams notably recalls that as good a driver as Senna was, ultimately \"he was an even greater man outside of the car than he was in it.\"\n\n\nIn 1992, Senna received a fine and a temporary driving ban in the UK after driving a Porsche at speeds up to 121\u00a0mph (194.7\u00a0km/h) on the M25 near London.[164]\n\n\nSenna was married to Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza from 1981 until 1982. Vasconcelos, whom he had known since childhood, had difficulty adapting to her husband's racing life in England. Vasconcelos later said: \"I was his second passion. His first passion was racing... There was nothing more important in the world for him, not family, not wife, nothing.\"[165] Though he did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father out of a sense of pride.[166] The marriage ended in divorce. Senna then courted Adriane Yamin, daughter of an entrepreneur from S\u00e3o Paulo, who was 15 years old when they began the relationship in 1985 and often chaperoned by her mother during meetings with Senna. They were briefly engaged, but the relationship was broken off by Senna in late 1988.[167] Senna dated Brazilian TV star Xuxa from late 1988 until 1990. He then dated Christine Ferracciu, who lived with him at his homes in Monaco and Portugal, on and off between 1990 and 1991.[167] Senna also had an affair with American model Carol Alt,[168] and briefly dated models Marjorie Andrade and Elle Macpherson.[167][169] At the time of his death, Senna was in a relationship with Brazilian model, and later TV personality, Adriane Galisteu.[170]\n\n\nOne of the most extravagant claims involving Senna's past partners was made by Edilaine de Barros, a former model better known as Marcella Praddo. She alleged that the couple dated from 1992 to 1994. Barros' child, Victoria, was born weeks after Senna's death, and claims that Senna was the father were soon made but abandoned following their rejection by the Senna family. Years later, after joining a religious sect, the former model was convinced to sue against the estate of Senna. In 2000, DNA tests of hair and saliva samples given by Senna's parents conclusively proved that he was not the father of de Barros' child.[171]\n\n\nIn his early years in Formula One, Senna was the subject of a smear campaign orchestrated by Nelson Piquet, ranging from Senna being regarded as a taxi driver to being homosexual given his failed marriage.[172] According to a 1990 interview by Brazilian edition of *Playboy*, Senna declared that he lost his virginity at 13 years of age to a prostitute arranged by his cousin, and he also insinuated that he had a relationship with Piquet's would-be wife (hence Piquet's acrimony).[172]\n\n\nFormer Formula One driver Bruno Senna is the nephew of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: \"If you think I'm fast, just wait until you see my nephew Bruno.\"[173] Due to the death of his uncle, Bruno initially gave up motor racing at his family's insistence.[174] He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.[175]\n\n\n\n## Non-racing commercial activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of Senna's NSXs on display at the Goodwood Festival of Speed\nIn the late 1980s, to take advantage of the relationship Honda had formed with Senna, the Japanese company asked him to help fine-tune the Honda NSX's suspension setting during its final development stages. Test runs were conducted at various circuits, including five sessions with prototypes at the Suzuka Circuit where chief NSX engineer Shigeru Uehara and his team were present to gather Senna's direct input.[176] Senna found the prototype NSX initially lacked chassis stiffness to the level to which he was accustomed, so the final production version was further reinforced to his satisfaction.[177]\n\n\nSenna reportedly had access to three of these cars: a black 1993 NSX in Brazil, which he ordered to his specifications, bearing license plate BSS-8888, which represents his initials for \"Beco\" \u2013 his childhood nickname \u2013 \"Senna da Silva\" and 8 to commemorate his first F1 championship in 1988; a red one with licence plate SX-25-59, which was loaned to him by Honda Portugal; a black one purchased by Antonio Carlos de Almeida Braga, who was a close personal friend, manager, and mentor of Ayrton Senna.[178]\nSenna also appeared in different commercials for the 4th generation Honda Prelude.\n\n\nSenna was also instrumental in bringing Audi cars into his native country, both as an import and manufacturing business. Audi entered Brazil in 1994 via Senna's company, Senna Import, founded in 1993. Sales began in April that year, just a month before his untimely death. In 1999, Audi Senna was created as a joint venture of Audi with Senna Import.[179] Aside from the black NSX mentioned above, Senna's other personal car in 1994 was a silver Audi 100 S4 Avant.[180][181]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Senna developed his own merchandise brand represented by a logo with a double S, after his full surname, \"Senna da Silva\".[182] This logo is meant to represent an S chicane on a racing circuit. The Senna brand was used for apparel, watches, bicycles (Carraro), motorcycles and boats. Hublot,[183] TAG Heuer,[184] and Universal Gen\u00e8ve[185] have created limited-edition watches to honour Senna, both during his lifetime and after his death.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Ayrton Senna at the Parco delle Acque Minerali by the Tamburello corner of the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Italy\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long and excessively detailed.** Please consider summarizing the material. *(April 2023)*\n |\n\n\nMany safety improvements were made in the sport following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths and Barrichello's crash. These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner and other parts of the Imola circuit were altered for 1995. This was despite calls for action in 1989, after a serious high-speed crash in which Senna's friend, Gerhard Berger, suffered burns to his hand. No action took place after that crash because, following an inspection by Senna and Berger, they ended up siding with officials who had, for years, claimed that the wall could not be moved further back due to a river nearby.[186] Revised on-track medical procedures also saw personnel hold up curtains at crash sites, to prevent the public from viewing distressing images as had occurred on live television with Senna.\n\n\nIn July 1994, the Brazil national football team dedicated their World Cup victory to Senna, and collectively held a banner on the field after defeating Italy in the final.[187][188] Senna had met various members of the squad, including Ronaldo[189] and Leonardo, three months earlier in Paris, telling them \"this is our year\".[190][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Throughout the rest of the 1994 season, Senna was commemorated in various ways. Damon Hill, along with Michael Schumacher, dedicated their individual success to Senna with Hill's victory in the Spanish Grand Prix and Schumacher's world-championship victory in the Australian Grand Prix.[191][192]\n\n\nA few months before his death, Senna had discussed with his sister the foundation of a charitable organization, based on a desire to contribute to those less fortunate in a more organised and effective manner. After his death, Viviane Senna set up the Instituto Ayrton Senna in his honour, which has invested nearly US$80\u00a0million over the last 12 years in social programs and actions in partnership with schools, government, NGOs, and the private sector, aimed at offering children and teenagers from low-income backgrounds the skills and opportunities they need to develop their full potential as persons, citizens, and future professionals.[193] The foundation is officially advised by Bernie Ecclestone, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger. The Senninha (\"Little Senna\") cartoon character, born in 1993/94, was another means by which Senna extended his role-model status in favour of Brazilian children.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Senninha\n![](image)A monument dedicated to Senna's Formula 1 racing, located at the entrance of the tunnel under Ibirapuera Park in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nIn his home country of Brazil, the main freeway from the international airport to S\u00e3o Paulo and a tunnel along the route to the heart of the city are named in his honour. Also, one of the most important freeways of Rio de Janeiro is named after Senna (\"Avenida Ayrton Senna\"). The main road in Senna's Portuguese resort at Quinta do Lago, Algarve, was also dedicated to him, because his villa there was very near (but not on) this road. A portion of the Interlagos Circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo is named the \"Senna Esse Chicane\" in his honour and decorated with commissioned art from beloved Brazilian artist Luciana Bermelho. In the English town of Reading, Berkshire, where Senna lived for a short period of time, a street in the suburb of Tilehurst was named after him.[195]\n\n\nIn April 2000, Senna was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.[196] That year, the UK public also voted Senna's opening lap of the 1993 European Grand Prix, the 43rd in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[197]\n\n\nIn 2004, a book called *Ayrton: The Hero Revealed* (original title: *Ayrton: O Her\u00f3i Revelado*[198]) was published in Brazil for the 10th anniversary of his death. Senna remains a national hero in Brazil and his grave attracts more visitors than the graves of John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley combined.[149]\n\n\nIn addition, to mark the 10th anniversary of Senna's death, on 21 April 2004, over 10,000 people attended a charity match in a football stadium near Imola. The game was organised by several devoted Italian and Canadian fans of Senna, bringing the Brazil team that won the 1994 World Cup to face the \"Nazionale Piloti\", an exhibition team composed exclusively of top race car drivers. Senna had been a part of the latter in 1985. Michael Schumacher, Jarno Trulli, Rubens Barrichello, Fernando Alonso, and many others faced the likes of Dunga, Careca, Taffarel, and several of the team that won the FIFA World Cup in the United States 10 years earlier. The match finished 5\u20135 and the money was donated to the IAS. Viviane Senna, the president of the IAS, was also involved in the kick-off of this match. That same weekend, Bernie Ecclestone revealed that he still believed Senna was and remained the best F1 driver he had ever seen.[135]\n\n\nSince his death, Senna has been the subject of several songs (either wholly dedicated to him or simply referring to him) including by: Italian singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla (song titled \"Ayrton\"[199]), Italian rock band The Rock Alchemist, whose 2012 song \"Live or Die\" and their 2018 video for \"Live Or Die\" are inspired by the life and character of Ayrton Senna, Jazz pianist Kim Pensyl; Japanese jazz-fusion guitarist and T-square bandleader Masahiro Andoh (references in songs such as \"Faces\" and subsequent revisions, like \"The Face\"); Chris Rea (on his song \"Saudade\"); Spanish band Delorean (2009 extended play entitled *Ayrton Senna*); British acid jazz band Corduroy (1994 song \"Ayrton Senna\").\n\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, to pay tribute to Senna, the Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati produced three special \"Senna\" editions of their 916 superbike. Ducati was at the time owned by Claudio Castiglioni, a personal friend of Senna who was an avid Ducati owner and endorsed the release of this 916 in March 1994. In 2002, under the presidency of Castiglioni, MV Agusta also released the special-edition F4 750 Senna motorbike followed by the F4 Senna 1000 in 2006. In both instances, each edition was limited to 300 units and, just like with the Ducati, all profits from sales were donated to the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[200] In 2013, Ducati also released a special edition of their new top-of-the-range sportbike, the 1199 Panigale S Senna.[201] In 2014, the IAS commissioned a commemorative Vespa that was auctioned for charity. It was custom-painted in the colours of Ayrton Senna's helmet by Alan Mosca, the son of Senna's helmet design creator, Sid, based on more than 50 \"T5 Pole Position\" models of the PX125 scooter that Ayrton won as part of the award to Formula 1 polesitters introduced by Piaggio in 1985.[202]\n\n\nSince 1995, the first season after Senna's tragic death, every Williams F1 car displayed a small 'S' logo on its nose to honour their former driver and in support of the IAS.[203][204] A revised logo was featured in 2014 for the 20th anniversary of the driver's death.[203] In February 2022, however, the 'S' logo was removed from the livery of the Williams FW44, the team's first car to have been developed wholly under new owners, Dorilton Capital.[204] When asked about this decision, team principal Jost Capito stated that the team wanted to \"move on in the future\" and stop reminding its drivers of Senna's fatal accident, while also revealing plans to open a new space fully dedicated to the Brazilian driver in Williams' own museum, instead.[204] Capito admitted that Senna's family did not get involved in the decision to remove the logo, but said that efforts to tighten the team's ties with the Instituto Ayrton Senna were under way.[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Senna Chicane\" at the Adelaide Street Circuit, South Australia\n![](image)Ayrton Senna's statue in Wa\u0142brzych, Poland\nThe organisers of the former Formula One Grand Prix street circuit in Adelaide, South Australia, renamed the first chicane the \"Senna Chicane\" in his honour in 1994, and also a road in the Adelaide suburb of Wingfield is named \"Senna Road\".[205] A shortened version of the Adelaide circuit (which remains the site of Senna's last Formula One win) and the chicane remain in use for local motorsport events, and a commemorative concrete plaque installed in 1995, bearing Senna's signature and hand prints, is also located there.[206] The Adelaide circuit was said to be a favourite of Senna's, and he was reportedly unhappy about the upcoming shift of venue from Adelaide to Melbourne in 1996.[207] Other motorsports circuits have similarly named sections of their track after Senna, such as the Circuito de Jerez in Spain, Hockenheimring in Germany, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Canada, the Snetterton Circuit in the UK, the Circuito do Estoril in Portugal, and the Aut\u00f3dromo Juan y Oscar G\u00e1lvez in Argentina.\n\n\nHe has been voted the best driver of all time in various motorsport polls, including *F1 Racing* magazine's 2004 poll, and German newspaper *Bild am Sonntag*'s poll of current drivers in 2010.[208] In 2009, a poll of 217 current and former Formula One drivers conducted by *Autosport* magazine named Senna as \"the greatest Formula One driver who ever lived\".[209][210] In 2012, *BBC Sport* journalists voted Senna as the greatest Formula One driver of all time, after naming their top 20 greatest drivers in a countdown on their website.[211] In 1993, a poll of F1 drivers gave Senna a near-unanimous vote as the best driver in F1.[212]\n\n\nThe Japanese public ranked Senna 22nd in a 2006 survey of their favourite persons in history.[213] The results were part of *The Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan* program broadcast by Nippon TV on 7 May that year.[214]\n\n\nIn 2007, Prince Albert of Monaco unveiled a plaque in honour of Senna in a ceremony that was attended by Vivane Senna. An exhibition also took place that showcased Senna's victories around Monaco, along with his helmets that were borrowed from Senna's family and a selection of McLaren cars raced by Senna that were brought over from Motegi.[215]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2010, on the day that would have marked Senna's 50th birthday, the football team Corinthians, which Senna supported, played a tape in memory of Senna which was also part of the theme played at the S\u00e3o Paulo Motor Show.[216]\n\n\nOn 25 July 2010, the BBC motoring show, *Top Gear* paid tribute to Senna with British Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton driving Senna's original MP4/4, with which he won the 1988 title. This was prior to the release of the BAFTA Award winning documentary named after him, *Senna*, directed by Asif Kapadia. In this documentary broadcast only once by the BBC, Senna is named the number one driver ever, by fellow racing drivers. A StudioCanal, Working Title Films, and Midfield Films documentary production, *Senna* was released to critical acclaim.[217]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Honda released a video of an audio-visual tribute on the Suzuka circuit in the dark, titled \"Sound of Honda \u2013 Ayrton Senna 1989\". Using the telemetry and sound of the Honda-powered McLaren MP4/5 driven by the Brazilian driver, Honda recreated the then lap record lap of 1:38.041 minutes by positioning speakers and lights along the 5.8\u00a0km track and activating them in synchronization with the race car's position during that lap.[218] In May of that year, Honda also reconfirmed its return to the sport as McLaren's engine supplier from 2015, with both companies again leveraging on Senna's legend as part of their advertising campaign since.[219][220]\n\n\nOn 25 October 2013, a holiday PlayStation 3 bundle with Gran Turismo 6 was announced which is dedicated to his memory, with some of the proceeds of this bundle going to help the IAS.[221] This was not the first time that Senna was immortalized in a video game since, in 1992, Sega developed and published *Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II* for the Sega Mega Drive, Master System and Game Gear. Apart from featuring advice from Senna himself, the tracks included Senna's own farm circuit in Tatu\u00ed, S\u00e3o Paulo and it was based on the 1991 F1 World Championship (albeit with fictitious rival drivers and teams due to licensing restrictions). This was then followed by the Japan-exclusive *Ayrton Senna Personal Talk: Message for the Future* for the Sega Saturn, which was a multimedia compact disc containing interviews with Senna overlaid with still images.\n\n\nIn March 2014, during the Brazilian Carnival celebrations, the samba group Unidos da Tijuca paid tribute to Senna in one of their parades in Rio de Janeiro. The group showcased his McLaren car along with other characters associated with speed, such as Sonic, The Flash, and Usain Bolt. The school won the coveted trophy for the best parade of 2014.[222]\n\n\nOn 21 March 2014, Google had a special Doodle to honour Senna's 54th birthday that day.[223]\n\n\nIn occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, on 29 April 2014, in partnership with the IAS, the Brazilian regional airline Azul Linhas Aereas paid tribute by baptizing its Embraer ERJ-195 (registration no. PR-AYU (cn 19000434)) with a new name and livery. The airplane, which was formerly called \"Azultec\", has been renamed \"#sennasempre\" (\"Senna forever\") and features the IAS logo on the rear side of the fuselage and the graphics of Senna's F1 helmet at the front, making it appear as though it is wearing the iconic helmet.[224][225]\n\n\nTributes were also made at the Imola circuit to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death.[226][227] On 1 May 2014, thousands of fans from around the world gathered at the Tamburello corner, at the exact scene where Senna suffered his fatal crash 20 years earlier, to hold a minute's silence. Various current and former F1 drivers were in attendance, including: Ferrari drivers Fernando Alonso and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen; Ferrari Driver Academy member Jules Bianchi; Senna's close friend and McLaren teammate, Gerhard Berger; and the Italians Jarno Trulli, Ivan Capelli, Pierluigi Martini, Andrea de Cesaris, and Emanuele Pirro.[228] Flowers and other cherishable items were also placed around the statue of Senna, situated directly adjacent to the Tamburello corner.[229]\n\n\nIn May and July 2014, the Republic of San Marino issued 70,008 commemorative EUR 2,50 stamps[230][231] as well as 8,000 silver proof coins in Eur 5,00 denomination.[231] In December 2014, a French company also produced 520 commemorative coins designed by a Brazilian artist.[232] The American firm Rosland Capital collaborated with the Ayrton Senna Institute to produce a commemorative coin collection in 2017.[233]\n\n\nIn November 2014 British artist Ian Berry unveiled a portrait of Ayrton in S\u00e3o Paulo at the Institut Ayrton Senna to the press and the family of Ayrton Senna. The artist famed for his artwork using only jeans presented the piece, that also included the jeans of the Senna family to great acclaim.[234][235] The piece traveled around the world for many fans to see and commemorated the 20th anniversary of his passing.\n\n\nIn 2015, when Lewis Hamilton matched Ayrton's three titles, the Senna family gave him an edition of the Ian Berry portrait made out of the family's jeans, Viviane Senna presented it to him at the S\u00e3o Paulo GP.[236]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2017, after qualifying on pole for the Canadian Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton was presented with a Senna helmet that had been worn by Senna during a race. It was given by Senna's family in recognition of Hamilton's 65th pole position, matching Senna's tally.[237]\n\n\nMcLaren unveiled the McLaren Senna, a 789\u00a0bhp track-focused sports car named after Senna, on 9 December 2017.[238]\n\n\nOn 1 October 2018, Nike and Corinthians partnered with the Ayrton Senna Institute to unveil a never-before-seen collection inspired by the Lotus team's colour scheme and honouring Ayrton Senna, including the team's new third kit. The collection #LuteAt\u00e9SerEterno [fight until you're eternal] was intended as a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the driver's first world title, which he won at Suzuka, in Japan.[239] A half-Austrian, half-Brazilian flag was presented on the top step of the podium by the race winner of the 2019 Spanish Grand Prix in honour of Ratzenberger and Senna.[240]\n\n\nA DLC for Codemasters' *F1 2019* depicting Senna's rivalry with Alain Prost was released in June of the same year: it featured digitalized depictions of the two drivers, along with car liveries inspired by their helmet designs.[241]\n\n\nOn 8 May 2019, a sculpture of Senna by British artist Paul Oz was unveiled in Barcelona to mark the 25th anniversary of the driver's tragic death.[242]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2021, a bronze life-size statue of Ayrton Senna was unveiled in Walbrzych (Poland), standing in a street named after him.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMinor planet 6543 Senna is named in his honor.[243]\n\n\nIn 2020, Netflix announced development on a fictionalized miniseries about Ayrton Senna. Gabriel Leone is set to star, with a predicted release date of 2024.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Helmet design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senna's helmet bearing the colours of the Brazilian national flag\nIn his karting days, Senna's helmet consisted of a plain white background with notable features absent. He experimented with several designs to satisfy him, such as a white, yellow, and green helmet,[244] before settling on a design by Sid Mosca that included a yellow background with a green stripe surrounding the upper visor and a light metallic blue stripe surrounding the lower visor (both stripes are delineated in the other stripe's color) that was first seen in 1979; Mosca also painted helmets for Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.\n\n\nAccording to Mosca, the blue and green stripes symbolised movement and aggression, while the overall yellow colour symbolised youth;[9] the three colors were also identifiable with the Flag of Brazil. The helmet never had significant changes, apart from sponsorship. One such change was that Senna occasionally altered the stripe from blue to black. The tone of yellow changed a number of times, while usually a rich sunburst yellow, in 1985 and 1986 in some races, he used a fluorescent neon yellow colour. In 1994, the helmet was a lighter, paler yellow to complement the blue and white of the Williams car. He used a number of helmet brands throughout his career. From 1977 to 1989, he used Bell (Star \u2013 '77 to '82, XFM-1 \u2013 '83 to '89), from 1990 to 1991 Honda's own Rheos brand, 1992 to 1993 he used Shoei (X-4) and for 1994 he returned to using Bell (M3 Kevlar).[245] The helmet worn by Senna in the fatal race was returned to Bell in 2002 and was incinerated while family members watched.[246]\n\n\n\n### Third-party adaptations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bruno Senna's helmet design is an adaptation of his uncle's (seen here parading the 1985 Lotus 97T at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix).\nHis nephew Bruno wore a modified version of his helmet design (a yellow helmet with a green and blue stripe) during his Formula One career, but the stripes are shaped after an S rather than being straight, under the chin area it has a green stripe, and it has a blue rounded rectangle in the top area. Bruno sported a modified helmet design for the final three races of the 2011 season to honour the 20th anniversary of Ayrton winning his last world championship.[247]\n\n\nAt the 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello incorporated part of Senna's helmet design into his own.[248] For the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, another variant of Senna's helmet was used by Lewis Hamilton and by Barrichello too. Hamilton used the design with permission from Senna's sister Viviane and the helmet was later sold in support of the IAS.[249] At the 2015 Brazilian Grand Prix, Hamilton again varied his helmet design (this time, the rear only given FIA restrictions on design changes in force from 2015) accompanied with a Twitter announcement stating \"Just for you, Brazil!! A tribute to the greatest\".[250]\n\n\nOutside of motor racing, Brazilian cyclist Murilo Fischer wore a helmet based on Senna's helmet colour scheme of yellow with green and blue stripes on stage 11 of the 2015 Giro d'Italia, which finished on the Imola circuit.[251]\n\n\nFor the 2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, Pierre Gasly wore a special helmet with Senna's colours and the *Senna Sempre* (Senna Forever) badging on top.\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Series\n | Team\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1977\n

Driver records listed here include all rounds which formed part of the World Championship since 1950: this includes the Indianapolis 500 in 1950\u20131960 (though it was not run to Formula 1 rules), and the 1952 and 1953 World Championship Grands Prix (which were run to Formula 2 rules). Formula 1 races that were not qualification rounds for the World Championship are not included. Sprints are only included when specified.\n\n\nThis page is accurate as of the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix. Drivers who are competing in the 2023 Formula One World Championship are highlighted in **bold**.\n\n\n\n\n## Races entered and started[edit]\n\n\nDrivers are considered to be entered into a race if they attempt to compete in at least one official practice session with the intent of participating in the race. These drivers are noted on the entry list for that race. A driver is considered to have started a race if they line up on the grid or at the pit lane exit for the start of the race. If a race is stopped and restarted, participation in any portion of the race is counted, but only if that portion was in any way counted towards the final classification (e.g., races stopped before the end of the leader's second lap were declared null and void prior to 2005).\n\n\n\n### Total entries[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Driver\n | Seasons\n | Entries\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n |

the 1987 Belgian Grand Prix after running out of fuel and pushing his car over the line.

The 1952 and 1953 World Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, however 'World Championship' and 'Formula One' are commonly referred to synonymously and are treated as such for these records. Marco Apicella, who raced a mere 800 metres (2,600\u00a0ft) at the 1993 Italian Grand Prix, is frequently referred to as having the shortest Formula One career, but that is a technicality.\n20. **^** Including one penalty for Jenson Button.\n21. **^** Vettel recorded speeding in pit lane six seconds into his career as a Formula One driver).\n22. **^** Vettel was entered as a Friday practice only driver.[1]\n23. **^** 32nd to 2nd at the 1957 Indianapolis 500.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Arron, Simon; Gilmour, Rod (9 May 2008). \"Rubens Barrichello set for 257th race record\". *Telegraph.co.uk*.

He won 21 races with McLaren and has won 82 with Mercedes.\nLewis Hamilton holds the record for the most race wins in Formula One history, with 103 wins to date. Michael Schumacher, the previous record holder, is second with 91 wins, and Sebastian Vettel is third with 53 victories.[6][7] Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen holds the distinction of having the longest time between his first win and his last. He won his first Grand Prix at the 2003 Malaysian Grand Prix, and his last at the 2018 United States Grand Prix, a span of 15\u00a0years and 212\u00a0days.[8] Riccardo Patrese holds the record for the longest period of time between two race wins \u2013 more than six-and-a-half years between the 1983 South African Grand Prix and the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix.[9] Mario Andretti had to wait the longest time between his maiden victory at the 1971 South African Grand Prix and his second win \u2013 coming five years, seven months and 18 days later at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix.[10] Max Verstappen holds the record for the most consecutive wins, having won ten Grands Prix in a row in 2023.[11] Verstappen is also the youngest winner of a Grand Prix; he was 18 years and 228 days old when he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix.[12] Luigi Fagioli is the oldest winner of a Formula One Grand Prix; he was 53\u00a0years and 22\u00a0days old when he won the 1951 French Grand Prix.[13]\n\n\nAs of the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, out of the 775 drivers who started a Grand Prix,[14] there have been 113 Formula One Grand Prix winners.[15] The first Grand Prix winner was Giuseppe Farina at the 1950 British Grand Prix, and the most recent driver to score their first Grand Prix win is George Russell who took his first win at the 2022 S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix.[15] Three Grands Prix, the 1951 French, the 1956 Argentine and the 1957 British Grand Prix, were won by two drivers sharing a car.[16]\n\n\nThis list includes the winners of the Indianapolis 500 race between 1950 and 1960, as they formed part of the World Championships, even though they were not run by Formula One regulations, nor are they referred to as Grands Prix.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## By
