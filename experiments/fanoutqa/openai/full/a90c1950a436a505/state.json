Cities may be defined as the cities proper, the extent of their urban area, or their metropolitan regions.\n\n\n\n\n## Definitions[edit]\n\n\n### City proper (administrative)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: City proper\n\n![Map](image)The municipality of Chongqing, China, whose administrative jurisdictional area is around the size of Austria, has the largest population for a city proper. However, more than 70% of its residents live in rural areas.\n\nA city can be defined by its administrative boundaries, otherwise known as city proper. UNICEF defines city proper as, \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority.\" A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of local government.[1][2][3] Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs.[4]\n\n\nThe use of city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives.[4] Because of this definition, the city proper population figure may differ greatly from the urban area population figure, as many cities are amalgamations of smaller municipalities (Australia), and conversely, many Chinese cities govern territories that extend well beyond the core urban area into suburban and rural areas.[5] The Chinese municipality of Chongqing, which is the largest city proper in the world by population, comprises a huge administrative area of 82,403\u00a0km2, around the size of Austria. However, more than 70% of its 30-million population are actually agricultural workers living in a rural setting.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Urban area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Urban area\n\nA city can be defined as a conditionally contiguous urban area, without regard to territorial or other boundaries inside an urban area. UNICEF defines urban area as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> The definition of \"urban\" varies from country to country, and, with periodic reclassification, can also vary within one country over time, making direct comparisons difficult. An urban area can be defined by one or more of the following: administrative criteria or political boundaries (e.g., area within the jurisdiction of a municipality or town committee), a threshold population size (where the minimum for an urban settlement is typically in the region of 2,000 people, although this varies globally between 200 and 50,000), population density, economic function (e.g., where a significant majority of the population is not primarily engaged in agriculture, or where there is surplus employment) or the presence of urban characteristics (e.g., paved streets, electric lighting, sewerage).\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to Demographia, an urban area is a continuously built up land mass of urban development that is within a labor market (metropolitan area or metropolitan region) and contains no rural land.[8]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metropolitan area\n\n![](image)Tokyo is the world's largest city by urban area and metropolitan area.\nA city can be defined by the inhabitants of its demographic population, as by metropolitan area, or labour market area. UNICEF defines metropolitan area as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> A formal local government area comprising the urban area as a whole and its primary commuter areas, typically formed around a city with a large concentration of people (i.e., a population of at least 100,000). In addition to the city proper, a metropolitan area includes both the surrounding territory with urban levels of residential density and some additional lower-density areas that are adjacent to and linked to the city (e.g., through frequent transport, road linkages or commuting facilities).\n> \n> \n\n\nIn many countries, metropolitan areas are established either with an official organisation or only for statistical purposes. In the United States, metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB).[9] In the Philippines, metropolitan areas have an official agency, such as Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), which manages Manila metropolitan area.[10] Similar agencies exist in Indonesia, such as Jabodetabekjur Development Cooperation Agency for Jakarta metropolitan area.[11]\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\nThere are 81 cities in the world with a population exceeding 5 million people, according to 2018 estimates by the United Nations. The U.N. figures include a mixture of city proper, metropolitan area, and urban area.[12]\n\n\n\n* ![Tokyo, Japan: 39.1 million people (urban area)](image)\n\nTokyo, Japan: 39.1 million people (urban area)\n* ![Jakarta, Indonesia: 34.5 million people (urban area)](image)\n\nJakarta, Indonesia: 34.5 million people (urban area)\n* ![Delhi, India: 32.2 million people (urban area)](image)\n\nDelhi, India: 32.2 million people (urban area)\n* ![Seoul, South Korea: 26 million people (metropolitan area)](image)\n\nSeoul, South Korea: 26 million people (metropolitan area)\n* ![Shanghai, China: 24.8 million people (municipal area)](image)\n\nShanghai, China: 24.8 million people (municipal area)\n* ![Manila, Philippines: 24.1 million people (urban area)](image)\n\nManila, Philippines: 24.1 million people (urban area)\n* ![S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: 22 million people (metropolitan area)](image)\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: 22 million people (metropolitan area)\n* ![Beijing, China: 21.9 million people (municipal area)](image)\n\nBeijing, China: 21.9 million people (municipal area)\n* ![Mexico City, Mexico: 21.8 million people (metropolitan area)](image)\n\nMexico City, Mexico: 21.8 million people (metropolitan area)\n* ![Mumbai, India: 20.7 million people (metropolitan area)](image)\n\nMumbai, India: 20.7 million people (metropolitan area)\n* ![New York City, U.S.: 19.4 million people (urban area)](image)\n\nNew York City, U.S.: 19.4 million people (urban area)\n\n\n\n\n\n| City[a] | Country\n | UN 2018 population estimates[b] | City proper[c] | Urban area[8] | Metropolitan area[d] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Definition\n | Population\n | Area(km2) | Density(/km2) | Population\n | Area(km2) | Density(/km2) | Population\n | Area(km2) | Density(/km2) |\n| Tokyo | Japan\n | 37,468,000\n | Metropolis prefecture | 13,515,271 | 2,191 | 6,169[13] | 37,732,000 | 8,231 | 4,584[e] | 37,274,000 | 13,452 | 2,771[14] |\n| Delhi | India\n | 28,514,000\n | Municipal corporation | 16,753,235 | 1,484 | 11,289[15] | 32,226,000 | 2,344 | 13,748[f] | 29,000,000 | 3,483 | 8,326[16] |\n| Shanghai | China\n | 25,582,000\n | Municipality | 24,870,895 | 6,341 | 3,922[17][18] | 24,073,000 | 4,333 | 5,556[g] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| S\u00e3o Paulo | Brazil\n | 21,650,000\n | Municipality | 12,252,023 | 1,521 | 8,055[19] | 23,086,000 | 3,649 | 6,327[h] | 21,734,682 | 7,947 | 2,735[20] |\n| Mexico City | Mexico\n | 21,581,000\n | City-state | 9,209,944 | 1,485 | 6,202[21] | 21,804,000 | 2,530 | 8,618\n | 21,804,515 | 7,866 | 2,772[22] |\n| Cairo | Egypt\n | 20,076,000\n | Urban governorate | 9,500,000 | 3,085 | 3,079[23] | 20,296,000 | 2,010 | 10,098\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| Mumbai | India\n | 19,980,000\n | Municipal corporation | 12,478,447 | 603 | 20,694[24] | 24,973,000 | 976 | 25,587[i] | 24,400,000 | 4,355 | 5,603[25] |\n| Beijing | China\n | 19,618,000\n | Municipality | 21,893,095 | 16,411 | 1,334[17][18] | 18,522,000 | 4,284 | 4,324\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| Dhaka | Bangladesh\n | 19,578,000\n | Capital city | 8,906,039 | 338 | 26,349[26][27] | 18,627,000 | 619 | 30,092\n | 14,543,124[28] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| Osaka | Japan\n | 19,281,000\n | Designated city | 2,725,006 | 225 | 12,111[13] | 15,126,000 | 3,020 | 5,009[j] | 19,303,000 | 13,228 | 1,459[14] |\n| New York | United States\n | 18,819,000\n | City | 8,804,190 | 778 | 11,316[29] | 21,509,000 | 12,093 | 1,779[k] | MSA: 19,557,311;

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one\u00a0million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit.\u2009'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kantt\u014d earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*T\u014dky\u014d* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | \u6771\u4eac |\n| Hiragana | \u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046 |\n| Katakana | \u30c8\u30a6\u30ad\u30e7\u30a6 |\n| Ky\u016bjitai | \u6771\u4eb0 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | T\u014dky\u014d |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (\u6c5f\u6238), a kanji compound of \u6c5f (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and \u6238 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (\u6771\u4eac, from \u6771 *t\u014d* \"east\", and \u4eac *ky\u014d* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (\u4eac) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (\u4eac\u90fd), Keij\u014d (\u4eac\u57ce), Beijing (\u5317\u4eac), Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), and Xijing (\u897f\u4eac)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"T\u014dkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, \u014cta D\u014dkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kant\u014d region. When he became *sh\u014dgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *sh\u014dgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Tait\u014d-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c.\u00a01930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Tait\u014d-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c.\u00a01930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943\u20131945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 \u2013 the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] \u2013 and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tenn\u014dzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7\u00a0m (786\u00a0ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7\u00a0m (786\u00a0ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) east to west and 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (\u591a\u6469\u5730\u57df) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (\u90fd), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq\u00a0mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (\u7279\u5225\u533a, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (\u5e02 *-shi*), five towns (\u753a *-ch\u014d* or *machi*), and eight villages (\u6751 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (\u7279\u5225\u533a, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo \u2013 Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d and Minato \u2013 are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017\u00a0m (6,617\u00a0ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737\u00a0m (5,699\u00a0ft)), Odake (1,266\u00a0m (4,154\u00a0ft)), and Mitake (929\u00a0m (3,048\u00a0ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachi\u014dji, Tachikawa, Machida, \u014cme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850\u00a0km (1,150\u00a0mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu \u014cshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, K\u014dzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachij\u014d-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu \u014cshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850\u00a0km (1,150\u00a0mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsury\u014d[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Ky\u016bry\u014d, Hamura Kusabana Ky\u016bry\u014d, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Ky\u016bry\u014d Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000\u00a0km (1,243\u00a0mi)\u2013long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4\u20136) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the H\u014dei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the H\u014dei eruption, the ash amount was 4\u00a0cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2\u00a0cm to 0.5\u00a0cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16\u00a0cm to 8\u00a0cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0\u00a0cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kant\u014d Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6\u20137% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3\u00a0km (3.9\u00a0mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72\u00a0ft) underground, with 70-meter (230\u00a0ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of K\u014dt\u014d, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Tait\u014d and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9\u00a0\u00b0C (80.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4\u00a0\u00b0C (41.7\u00a0\u00b0F). The record low temperature was \u22129.2\u00a0\u00b0C (15.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5\u00a0\u00b0C (103.1\u00a0\u00b0F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3\u00a0\u00b0C (86.5\u00a0\u00b0F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86.0\u00a0\u00b0F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0\u00a0in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30\u00a0in) of rain,[73] including 270.5\u00a0mm (10.65\u00a0in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5\u00a0mm (34.63\u00a0in) in 1984 to 2,229.6\u00a0mm (87.78\u00a0in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1875\u2013present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22129.2(15.4)\n | \u22127.9(17.8)\n | \u22125.6(21.9)\n | \u22123.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | \u22120.5(31.1)\n | \u22123.1(26.4)\n | \u22126.8(19.8)\n | \u22129.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22125(23)\n | \u22124(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | \u22121(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985\u20132015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kant\u014d.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580\u00a0billion yen ($5.5\u00a0billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3\u00a0\u00b0C (5.4\u00a0\u00b0F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000\u00a0ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88\u00a0ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436\u00a0ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000\u00a0ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000. As of 2014[update], roadside trees in Tokyo have increased to 950,000, and a further 300\u00a0ha (740 acres) of green space has been added.[94]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tokyo prefecture population pyramid in 2020\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 590,268 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1880 | 712,259 | +20.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,389,684 | +95.1% |\n| 1900 | 1,580,124 | +13.7% |\n| 1910 | 2,202,079 | +39.4% |\n| 1920 | 3,699,428 | +68.0% |\n| 1925 | 4,485,144 | +21.2% |\n| 1930 | 5,408,678 | +20.6% |\n| 1935 | 6,369,919 | +17.8% |\n| 1940 | 7,354,971 | +15.5% |\n| 1945 | 3,488,284 | \u221252.6% |\n| 1950 | 6,277,500 | +80.0% |\n| 1955 | 8,037,084 | +28.0% |\n| 1960 | 9,683,802 | +20.5% |\n| 1965 | 10,869,244 | +12.2% |\n| 1970 | 11,408,071 | +5.0% |\n| 1975 | 11,673,554 | +2.3% |\n| 1980 | 11,618,281 | \u22120.5% |\n| 1985 | 11,829,363 | +1.8% |\n| 1990 | 11,855,563 | +0.2% |\n| 1995 | 11,773,605 | \u22120.7% |\n| 2000 | 12,064,101 | +2.5% |\n| 2005 | 12,576,601 | +4.2% |\n| 2010 | 13,159,388 | +4.6% |\n| 2015 | 13,515,271 | +2.7% |\n| 2020 | 13,982,112 | +3.5% |\n\n\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506\u00a0million people in Tokyo, with 9.214\u00a0million living within Tokyo's 23 wards.[95] During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5\u00a0million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4\u00a0million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo\u2013Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2\u00a0trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, \u014cme, Okutama, Hachi\u014dji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu \u014cshima and Hachij\u014d-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81\u00a0million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4\u00a0trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of K\u014dt\u014d ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at \u014cta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachij\u014d-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu \u014cshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kant\u014d region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunky\u014d](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunky\u014d\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sann\u014d at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Ch\u014dfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuch\u016b) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuch\u016b).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The other 14,120 islands are classified as \"remote islands\" by the Japanese government.[9][11] The Ryukyu Islands and Nanp\u014d Islands are south and east of the main islands.\n\n\nThe territory covers 377,973.89\u00a0km2 (145,936.53\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2] It is the fourth largest island country in the world and the largest island country in East Asia.[12] The country has the 6th longest coastline at 29,751\u00a0km (18,486\u00a0mi) and the 8th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 4,470,000\u00a0km2 (1,730,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the world.[13]\n\n\nThe terrain is mostly rugged and mountainous with 66% forest.[14] The population is clustered in urban areas on the coast, plains and valleys.[15] Japan is located in the northwestern Ring of Fire on multiple tectonic plates.[16] East of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches. The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate.[17] The continuous subduction process causes frequent earthquakes, tsunami and stratovolcanoes.[18] The islands are also affected by typhoons. The subduction plates have pulled the Japanese archipelago eastward, created the Sea of Japan and separated it from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading 15 million years ago.[16]\n\n\nThe climate varies from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical and tropical rainforest in the south. These differences in climate and landscape have allowed the development of a diverse flora and fauna, with some rare endemic species, especially in the Ogasawara Islands.\n\n\nJapan extends from 20\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) and from 122\u00b0 to 153\u00b0 east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima).[19] Japan is surrounded by seas. To the north the Sea of Okhotsk separates it from the Russian Far East, to the west the Sea of Japan separates it from the Korean Peninsula, to the southwest the East China Sea separates the Ryukyu Islands from China and Taiwan, to the east is the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of Japan\n![](image)Japanese archipelago with outlined islands\nThe Japanese archipelago is over 3,000\u00a0km (1,900\u00a0mi) long in a north-to-southwardly direction from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Philippine Sea in the Pacific Ocean.[8] It is narrow, and no point in Japan is more than 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) from the sea. In 2023, a government recount of the islands with digital maps increased the total from 6,852 to 14,125 islands.[9] The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. Three of the four major islands (Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) are separated by narrow straits of the Seto Inland Sea and form a natural entity. The 6,847 smaller islands are called remote islands.[10][11] This includes the Bonin Islands, Dait\u014d Islands, Minami-Tori-shima, Okinotorishima, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Nansei Islands, and the Nanp\u014d Islands, as well as numerous islets, of which 430 are inhabited. The Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan but disputed by China. This excludes the disputed Northern Territories (Kuril islands) and Liancourt Rocks. In total, as of 2021, Japan's territory is 377,973.89\u00a0km2 (145,936.53\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), of which 364,546.41\u00a0km2 (140,752.16\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is land and 13,430\u00a0km2 (5,190\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) water.[2] Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (29,751\u00a0km (18,486\u00a0mi)). It is the largest island country in East Asia and fourth largest island country in the world.[12]\n\n\nBecause of Japan's many far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine life and mineral resources in the ocean. The Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan covers 4,470,000\u00a0km2 (1,730,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and is the 8th largest in the world. It is more than 11 times the land area of the country.[13] The Exclusive Economic Zone stretches from the baseline out to 200 nautical miles (370\u00a0km) from its coast. Its territorial sea is 12\u00a0nmi (22.2\u00a0km; 13.8\u00a0mi), but between 3 and 12\u00a0nmi (5.6 and 22.2\u00a0km; 3.5 and 13.8\u00a0mi) in the international straits\u2014La P\u00e9rouse (or S\u014dya Strait), Tsugaru Strait, \u014csumi, and Tsushima Strait.\n\n\nJapan has a population of 126 million in 2019.[20] It is the 11th most populous country in the world and second most populous island country.[12] 81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanp\u014d Islands.\n\n\n\n\n## Map of Japan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Regions and prefectures of Japan\nMain article: Regions of Japan\n\nJapan is informally divided into eight regions from northeast (Hokkaid\u014d) to southwest (Ryukyu Islands):[21]\n\n\n\n* Hokkaid\u014d\n* T\u014dhoku region\n* Kant\u014d region\n* Ch\u016bbu region\n* Kansai (or Kinki) region\n* Ch\u016bgoku region\n* Shikoku\n* Ky\u016bsh\u016b\n\n\nEach region contains several prefectures, except the Hokkaido region, which comprises only Hokkaido Prefecture.\n\n\nThe regions are not official administrative units, but have been traditionally used as the regional division of Japan in a number of contexts. For example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions, weather reports usually give the weather by region, and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name (Kinki Nippon Railway, Ch\u016bgoku Bank, Tohoku University, etc.). While Japan has eight High Courts, their jurisdictions do not correspond with the eight regions.\n\n\n\n## Composition, topography and geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A topographic map of Japan\nAbout 73% of Japan is mountainous,[22] with a mountain range running through each of the main islands. Japan's highest mountain is Mount Fuji, with an elevation of 3,776\u00a0m (12,388\u00a0ft). Japan's forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden.[14]\n\n\nSince there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century. Hot springs are numerous and have been exploited by the leisure industry.\n\n\nThe Geospatial Information Authority of Japan measures Japan's territory annually in order to continuously grasp the state of the national land. As of July 1, 2021, Japan's territory is 377,973.89 square kilometres (145,936.53\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It increases in area due to volcanic eruptions such as Nishinoshima (\u897f\u4e4b\u5cf6), the natural expansion of the islands, and land reclamation.[2]\n\n\nThis table shows the land use in 2002.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Forest\n | Agricultural land\n | Residential area\n | Water surface, rivers, waterways\n | Roads\n | Wilderness\n | Other\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 66.4% | 12.8% | 4.8% | 3.6% | 3.4% | 0.7% | 8.3%\n |\n| 251,000\u00a0km2 (97,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) | 48,400\u00a0km2 (18,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) | 18,100\u00a0km2 (7,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) | 13,500\u00a0km2 (5,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) | 13,000\u00a0km2 (5,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) | 2,600\u00a0km2 (1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) | 31,300\u00a0km2 (12,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n |\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is relatively far away from the Asian continent. Kyushu is closest to the southernmost point of the Korean peninsula with a distance of 190\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi), which is almost 6 times farther away than from England to France across the English Channel. Thus historically Kyushu was the gateway between Asia and Japan. China is separated by 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) of sea from Japan's big main islands. Hokkaido is near Sakhalin, which was occupied by Japan from 1905 to 1945. Most of the population lives on the Pacific coast side of Honsh\u016b. The west coast facing the Sea of Japan is less densely populated.[24]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago was difficult to reach since before ancient history. During the Paleolithic period around 20,000 BCE at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, there was a land bridge between Hokkaido and Sakhalin which linked Japan with the Asian continent. The land bridge disappeared when the sea levels rose in the J\u014dmon period around 10,000 BCE.[25]\n\n\nJapan's remote location, surrounded by vast seas, rugged, mountainous terrain and steep rivers make it secure against invaders and uncontrolled migration from the Asian continent. The Japanese can close their civilization with an isolationist foreign policy. During the Edo period the Tokugawa Shogunate enforced the Sakoku policy which prohibited most foreign contact and trade from 1641 to 1853.[26] In modern times, the inflow of people is managed via the seaports and airports. Thus Japan is fairly insulated from continental issues.\n\n\nThroughout history, Japan was never fully invaded nor colonized by other countries. The Mongols tried to invade Japan twice and failed in 1274 and 1281. Japan capitulated only once after nuclear attacks in World War II. At the time Japan did not have nuclear technology. The insular geography is a major factor for the isolationist, semi-open and expansionist periods of Japanese history.\n\n\n\n### Mountains and volcanoes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mountains and hills of Japan by height\n\nThe mountainous islands of the Japanese archipelago form a crescent off the eastern coast of Asia.[27] They are separated from the continent by the Sea of Japan, which serves as a protective barrier. Japan has 108 active volcanoes (10% of the world's active volcanoes) because of active plate tectonics in the Ring of Fire.[18]\n\n\nAround 15 million years ago, the volcanic shoreline of the Asian continent was pushed out into a series of volcanic island arcs.[16] This created the \"back-arc basins\" known as the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk with the formal shaping of the Japanese archipelago.[16] The archipelago also has summits of mountain ridges that were uplifted near the outer edge of the continental shelf.[27] About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent.[27] A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves, the \"face\", fronting on the Pacific Ocean, and the \"back\", toward the Sea of Japan.[27] On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.[27]\n\n\nCentral Japan is marked by the convergence of the three mountain chains\u2014the Hida, Kiso, and Akaishi mountains\u2014that form the Japanese Alps (*Nihon Arupusu*), several of whose peaks are higher than 3,000 metres (9,800\u00a0ft).[27] The highest point in the Japanese Alps is Mount Kita at 3,193 metres (10,476\u00a0ft).[27] The highest point in the country is Mount Fuji (Fujisan, also erroneously called Fujiyama), a volcano dormant since 1707 that rises to 3,776\u00a0m (12,388\u00a0ft) above sea level in Shizuoka Prefecture.[27] On the Sea of Japan side are plateaus and low mountain districts, with altitudes of 500 to 1,500 meters.[27]\n\n\n\n### Plains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Kant\u014d Plain\nThere are three major plains in central Honsh\u016b. The largest is the Kant\u014d Plain which covers 17,000\u00a0km2 (6,600\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the Kant\u014d region. The capital Tokyo and the largest metropolitan population is located there. The second largest plain in Honsh\u016b is the N\u014dbi Plain 1,800\u00a0km2 (690\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with the third-most-populous urban area Nagoya. The third largest plain in Honsh\u016b is the Osaka Plain which covers 1,600\u00a0km2 (620\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the Kinki region. It features the second largest urban area of Osaka (part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area). Osaka and Nagoya extend inland from their bays until they reach steep mountains. The Osaka Plain is connected with Kyoto and Nara. Kyoto is located in the Yamashiro Basin 827.9\u00a0km2 (319.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and Nara is in the Nara Basin 300\u00a0km2 (120\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThe Kant\u014d Plain, Osaka Plain and N\u014dbi Plain are the most important economic, political and cultural areas of Japan. These plains had the largest agricultural production and large bays with ports for fishing and trade. This made them the largest population centers. Kyoto and Nara are the ancient capitals and cultural heart of Japan. The Kant\u014d Plain became Japan's center of power, because it is the largest plain with a central location and historically it had the most agricultural production that could be taxed. The Tokugawa Shogunate established a *bakufu* in Edo in 1603.[28] This evolved into the capital of Tokyo by 1868.\n\n\nHokkaido has multiple plains such as the Ishikari Plain 3,800\u00a0km2 (1,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Tokachi Plain 3,600\u00a0km2 (1,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), the Kushiro Plain is the largest wetland in Japan 2,510\u00a0km2 (970\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and Sarobetsu Plain 200\u00a0km2 (77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). There are many farms that produce a plethora of agricultural products. The average farm size in Hokkaido is 26 hectares per farmer in 2013. That is nearly 11 times larger than the national average of 2.4 hectares. This made Hokkaido the most agriculturally rich prefecture of Japan.[29] Nearly one fourth of Japan's arable land and 22% of Japan's forests are in Hokkaido.[30]\n\n\nAnother important plain is the Sendai Plain around the city of Sendai in northeastern Honsh\u016b.[27] Many of these plains are along the coast, and their areas have been increased by land reclamation throughout recorded history.[27]\n\n\n\n### Rivers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shinano River in Niigata City\nMain article: List of rivers of Japan\n\nRivers are generally steep and swift, and few are suitable for navigation except in their lower reaches. Although most rivers are less than 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) in length, their rapid flow from the mountains is what provides hydroelectric power.[27] Seasonal variations in flow have led to extensive development of flood control measures.[27] The longest, the Shinano River, which winds through Nagano Prefecture to Niigata Prefecture and flows into the Sea of Japan, is 367\u00a0km (228\u00a0mi) long.[27][31]\n\n\nThese are the 10 longest rivers of Japan.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Region\n | Prefecture\n | Length\n(km)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Shinano | Hokuriku | Nagano, Niigata | 367\n |\n| 2\n | Tone | Kant\u014d | Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma | 322\n |\n| 3\n | Ishikari | Hokkaid\u014d | Hokkaid\u014d | 268\n |\n| 4\n | Teshio | Hokkaid\u014d | Hokkaid\u014d | 256\n |\n| 5\n | Kitakami | T\u014dhoku | Iwate, Miyagi | 249\n |\n| 6\n | Abukuma | T\u014dhoku | Fukushima, Miyagi | 239\n |\n| 7\n | Mogami | T\u014dhoku | Yamagata | 229\n |\n| 8\n | Tenryu | Ch\u016bbu | Nagano, Aichi, Shizuoka | 212\n |\n| 9\n | Agano | Hokuriku | Niigata | 210\n |\n| 10\n | Shimanto | Shikoku | K\u014dchi | 196\n |\n\n\n### Lakes and coasts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Lake Biwa\nMain article: List of lakes of Japan\n\nThe largest freshwater lake is Lake Biwa 670.3\u00a0km2 (258.8\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), northeast of Kyoto in Shiga Prefecture.[32] Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and estimated to be the 13th oldest lake in the world dating to at least 4 million years ago.[33][32] It has consistently carried water for millions of years. Lake Biwa was created by plate tectonics in an active rift zone. This created a very deep lake with a maximum depth of 104\u00a0m (341\u00a0ft). Thus it has not naturally filled with sediment. Over the course of millions of years, a diverse ecosystem evolved in the lake. It has more than 1,000 species and subspecies. There are 46 native fish species and subspecies,[34] including 11 species and 5 subspecies that are endemic or near-endemic.[32] Approximately 5,000 water birds visit the lake each year.\n\n\nThe following are the 10 largest lakes of Japan.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Name | Region | Prefecture\u00b9 | Municipalities\n | Type\n | Water | Area(km2)\n | Max Depth(m)\n | Altitude(m)\n | Volume(km\u00b3)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Biwa | Kansai | Shiga | \u014ctsu, Kusatsu, Higashi-\u014cmi, HikoneNagahama, Moriyama, \u014cmi-HachimanTakashima, Yasu, Maibara | Ancient lake, tectonic, freshwater | Fresh | 670.3 | 103.8 | 85 | 27.5\n |\n| 2 | Kasumigaura | Kant\u014d | Ibaraki | Tsuchiura, Ishioka, Omitama, InashikiAmi, Kasumigaura, Namegata, Itako, Miho | Warm monomictic lake | Fresh | 167.6 | 7.10 | 0 | 0.85\n |\n| 3 | Saroma | Hokkaid\u014d | Abashiri | Kitami, Saroma, Y\u016bbetsu | Mesotrophic | Brackish | 151.9 | 19.6 | 0 | 1.3\n |\n| 4 | Inawashiro | T\u014dhoku | Fukushima | K\u014driyama, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Inawashiro | Tectonic lake | Fresh | 103.3 | 94.6 | 514 | 5.40\n |\n| 5 | Nakaumi | San'in | ShimaneTottori | Matsue, Yonago, YasugiSakaiminato, Higashi-Izumo | Brackish | Brackish | 86.2 | 17.1 | 0 | 0.47\n |\n| 6 | Kussharo | Hokkaid\u014d | Kushiro | Teshikaga | Acidotrophic crater lake | Fresh | 79.3 | 117.5 | 121 | 2.25\n |\n| 7 | Shinji | San'in | Shimane | Matsue, Izumo, Hikawa | Brackish | Brackish | 79.1 | 6.0 | 0 | 0.34\n |\n| 8 | Shikotsu | Hokkaid\u014d | Ishikari | Chitose | Crater lake | Fresh | 78.4 | 360.1 | 247 | 20.9\n |\n| 9 | T\u014dya | Hokkaid\u014d | Iburi | T\u014dyako, S\u014dbetsu | Oligotrophic crater lake | Fresh | 70.7 | 179.9 | 84 | 8.19\n |\n| 10 | Hamana | T\u014dkai | Shizuoka | Hamamatsu, Kosai, Arai | Brackish lagoon | Brackish | 65.0 | 13.1 | 0 | 0.35\n |\n\n\n![](image)Seto Inland Sea\nExtensive coastal shipping, especially around the Seto Inland Sea, compensates for the lack of navigable rivers.[27] The Pacific coastline south of Tokyo is characterized by long, narrow, gradually shallowing inlets produced by sedimentation, which has created many natural harbors.[27] The Pacific coastline north of Tokyo, the coast of Hokkaid\u014d, and the Sea of Japan coast are generally unindented, with few natural harbors.[27]\n\n\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 765\u00a0km\u00b2 of tidal flats in Japan, making it the 35th ranked country in terms of tidal flat extent.[36]\n\n\n\n### Land reclamation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kobe Airport in Osaka Bay\nThe Japanese archipelago has been transformed by humans into a sort of continuous land, in which the four main islands are entirely reachable and passable by rail and road transportation thanks to the construction of huge bridges and tunnels that connect each other and various islands.[37]\n\n\nApproximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (*umetatechi*).[38] It began in the 12th century.[38] Land was reclaimed from the sea and from river deltas by building dikes and drainage and rice paddies on terraces carved into mountainsides.[27] The majority of land reclamation projects occurred after World War II during the Japanese economic miracle. Reclamation of 80% to 90% of all the tidal flatland was done. Large land reclamation projects with landfill were done in coastal areas for maritime and industrial factories, such as Higashi Ogishima in Kawasaki, Osaka Bay and Nagasaki Airport. Port Island, Rokk\u014d Island and Kobe Airport were built in Kobe. Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise and Wakayama Marina City.[38] The village of \u014cgata in Akita, was established on land reclaimed from Lake Hachir\u014dgata (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totaled 172.03 square kilometres (66.42\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[39]\n\n\nExamples of land reclamation in Japan include:\n\n\n\n* Kyogashima, Kobe \u2013 first man-made island built by Taira no Kiyomori in 1173[38]\n* The Hibiya Inlet, Tokyo \u2013 first large scale reclamation project started in 1592[38]\n* Dejima, Nagasaki \u2013 built during Japan's national isolation period in 1634. It was the sole trading post in Japan during the Sakoku period and was originally inhabited by Portuguese and then Dutch traders.[38]\n* Tokyo Bay, Japan \u2013 249 square kilometres (96\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[40] artificial island (2007).\n\t+ This includes the entirety of Odaiba, a series of island forts constructed to protect Tokyo from sea attacks (1853).[38]\n* Kobe, Japan \u2013 23 square kilometres (8.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (1995).[38]\n* Isahaya Bay in the Ariake Sea \u2013 approximately 35 square kilometres (14\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is reclaimed with tide embankment and sluice gates (2018).\n* Yumeshima, Osaka \u2013 390 hectares (960 acres) artificial island (2025).\n* Central Breakwater \u2013 989 hectares (2,440 acres)\n\n\nMuch reclaimed land is made up of landfill from waste materials, dredged earth, sand, sediment, sludge and soil removed from construction sites. It is used to build man-made islands in harbors and embankments in inland areas.[38] From November 8, 2011, Tokyo City began accepting rubble and waste from the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami region. This rubble was processed, and when it had the appropriate radiation levels it was used as landfill to build new artificial islands in Tokyo Bay. Yamashita Park in Yokohama City was made with rubble from the great Kant\u014d earthquake in 1923.[38]\n\n\nThere is a risk of contamination on artificial islands with landfill and reclaimed land if there was industry that spilled (toxic) chemicals into the ground. For example, the artificial island Toyosu was once occupied by a Tokyo gas factory. Toxic substances were discovered in the soil and groundwater at Toyosu. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government spent an additional 3.8 billion yen ($33.5 million) to pump out groundwater by digging hundreds of wells.[41] In June 2017, plans to move the Tsukiji fish market were restarted[42] but delayed in July to the autumn of 2018.[43] After the new site was declared safe following a cleanup operation, Toyosu Market was opened.[44]\n\n\n\n## Oceanography and seabed of Japan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Relief map of the land and the seabed of Japan. It shows the surface and underwater terrain of the Japanese archipelago.\nJapan's sea territory is 4,470,000\u00a0km2 (1,730,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[13] Japan ranks fourth with its exclusive economic zone ocean water volume from 0 to 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) depth. Japan ranks fifth with sea volume of 2,000\u20133,000 meters, fourth with 3,000\u20134,000 meters, third with 4,000\u20135,000 meters and first with volume of 5,000 to over 6,000 meters. The relief map of the Japanese archipelago shows that 50% of Japan's sea territory has an ocean volume between 0 and 4,000\u00a0m (13,000\u00a0ft) depth. The other 50% has a depth of 4,000\u00a0m (13,000\u00a0ft) to over 6,000\u00a0m (20,000\u00a0ft). 19% has a depth of 0 to 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). Thus Japan possesses one of the largest ocean territories with a combination of all depths from shallow to very deep sea.[6] Multiple long undersea mountain ranges stretch from Japan's main islands to the south. They occasionally reach above the sea surface as islands. East of the undersea mountain ranges are three oceanic trenches: the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench (max depth 10,542\u00a0m (34,587\u00a0ft)), Japan Trench (max depth 10,375\u00a0m (34,039\u00a0ft)) and Izu\u2013Ogasawara Trench (max depth 9,810\u00a0m (32,190\u00a0ft)).\n\n\nThere are large quantities of marine life and mineral resources in the ocean and seabed of Japan. At a depth of over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft) there are minerals such as manganese nodules, cobalt in the crust and hydrothermal deposits.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The islands comprising the Japanese Archipelago were separated from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading.\n![](image)Tectonic map of Japan (French)\nMain article: Geology of Japan\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is the result of subducting tectonic plates over several 100 millions of years from the mid-Silurian (443.8 Mya) to the Pleistocene (11,700 years ago). Approximately 15,000\u00a0km (9,300\u00a0mi) of oceanic floor has passed under the Japanese archipelago in the last 450 million years, with most being fully subducted. It is considered a mature island arc.\n\n\nThe islands of Japan were created by tectonic plate movements:\n\n\n\n* Tohoku (upper half of Honshu), Hokkaido, Kuril islands and Sakhalin are located on the Okhotsk Plate. This is a minor tectonic plate bounded to the north by the North American Plate.[45][46] The Okhotsk Plate is bounded on the east by the Pacific Plate at the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench and the Japan Trench. It is bounded on the south by the Philippine Sea Plate at the Nankai Trough. On the west it is bounded by the Eurasian Plate and possibly on the southwest by the Amurian Plate. The northeastern boundary the Ulakhan Fault.[47]\n* The southern half of Honshu, Shikoku and most of Kyushu are located on the Amurian Plate.\n* The southern tip of Kyushu and the Ryukyu islands are located on the Okinawa Plate.\n* The Nanp\u014d Islands are on the Philippine Sea Plate.\n\n\nThe Pacific Plate and Philippine Sea Plate are subduction plates. They are deeper than the Eurasian plate. The Philippine Sea Plate moves beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south. The Pacific Plate moves under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. These subduction plates have pulled Japan eastward and opened the Sea of Japan by back-arc spreading around 15 million years ago.[16] The Strait of Tartary and the Korea Strait opened much later. La P\u00e9rouse Strait formed about 60,000 to 11,000 years ago closing the path used by mammoths which had earlier moved to northern Hokkaido.[48] The eastern margin of the Sea of Japan is an incipient subduction zone consisting of thrust faults which formed from compression and reactivation of old faults involved in earlier rifting.[49]\n\n\nThe subduction zone is where the oceanic crust slides beneath the continental crust or other oceanic plates. This is because the oceanic plate's litosphere has a higher density. Subduction zones are sites that usually have a high rate of volcanism and earthquakes.[50] Additionally, subduction zones develop belts of deformation[51] The subduction zones on the east side of the Japanese archipelago cause frequent low intensity earth tremors. Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis occur several times per century. It is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.[16] Northeastern Japan, north of Tanakura fault, had high volcanic activity 14\u201317\u00a0million years before present.[52]\n\n\n\n### Median Tectonic Line[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Red line represents Median Tectonic Line. Orange shaded region is Fossa Magna, bounded by the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (western blue line).\nThe Japan Median Tectonic Line (MTL) is Japan's longest fault system.[53][54] The MTL begins near Ibaraki Prefecture, where it connects with the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) and the Fossa Magna. It runs parallel to Japan's volcanic arc, passing through central Honsh\u016b to near Nagoya, through Mikawa Bay, then through the Seto Inland Sea from the Kii Channel and Naruto Strait to Shikoku along the Sadamisaki Peninsula and the Bungo Channel and H\u014dyo Strait to Ky\u016bsh\u016b.[54]\n\n\nThe MTL moves right-lateral strike-slip, at about 5\u201310 millimeters per year.[55] The sense of motion is consistent with the direction of the Nankai Trough's oblique convergence. The rate of motion on the MTL is much less than the rate of convergence at the plate boundary. This makes it difficult to distinguish the motion on the MTL from interseismic elastic straining in GPS data.[56]\n\n\n\n### Oceanic trenches[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map depicts the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench, Japan Trench, Izu\u2013Ogasawara Trench and Mariana Trench.\nEast of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches.\n\n\n\n* The Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench is in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It lies off the southeast coast of Kamchatka and parallels the Kuril Island chain to meet the Japan Trench east of Hokkaido.[57]\n* The Japan Trench extends 8,000\u00a0km (4,971\u00a0mi) from the Kuril Islands to the northern end of the Izu Islands. Its deepest part is 8,046\u00a0m (26,398\u00a0ft).[58] The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate. The subduction process causes bending of the down going plate, creating a deep trench. Continuous movement on the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench is one of the main causes of tsunamis and earthquakes in northern Japan, including the megathrust 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The rate of subduction associated with the Japan Trench has been recorded at about 7.9\u20139.2\u00a0cm (3.1\u20133.6\u00a0in)/yr.[17]\n* The Izu\u2013Ogasawara Trench is south of the Japan Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of the Izu Trench (at the north) and the Bonin Trench (at the south, west of the Ogasawara Plateau).[59] It stretches to the northernmost section of the Mariana Trench.[60] The Izu\u2013Ogasawara Trench is an extension of the Japan Trench. There the Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, creating the Izu Islands and Bonin Islands on the Izu\u2013Bonin\u2013Mariana Arc system.[61]\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe Japanese islands are formed of the mentioned geological units parallel to the subduction front. The parts of islands facing the Pacific Plate are typically younger and display a larger proportion of volcanic products, while island parts facing the Sea of Japan are mostly heavily faulted and folded sedimentary deposits. In northwest Japan are thick quaternary deposits. This makes determination of the geological history and composition difficult and it is not yet fully understood.[62]\n\n\nThe Japanese island arc system has distributed volcanic series where the volcanic rocks change from tholeiite\u2014calc-alkaline\u2014alkaline with increasing distance from the trench.[63][64] The geologic province of Japan is mostly basin and a bit extended crust.[65]\n\n\n\n## Growing archipelago[edit]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago grows gradually because of perpetual tectonic plate movements, earthquakes, stratovolcanoes and land reclamation in the Ring of Fire.\n\n\nFor example, during the 20th century several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific.[18] The 1914 Sakurajima eruption produced lava flows which connected the former island with the \u014csumi Peninsula in Kyushu.[66] It is the most active volcano in Japan.[67]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 eruption southeast of Nishinoshima, a new unnamed volcanic island emerged from the sea.[68] Erosion and shifting sands caused the new island to merge with Nishinoshima.[69][70] A 1911 survey determined the caldera was 107\u00a0m (351\u00a0ft) at its deepest.[71]\n\n\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami caused portions of northeastern Japan to shift by 2.4 metres (7\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) closer to North America.[72] This made some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before.[73] The areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts.[73] A 400-kilometre (250\u00a0mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 metres (2\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land.[73] On 6 April, the Japanese coast guard said that the earthquake shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24 metres (79\u00a0ft) and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft).[74] A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in *Science* on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) east-southeast and rose about 7 metres (23\u00a0ft) as a result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area.[75]\n\n\n\n## Sea of Japan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sea of Japan\nMain article: Sea of Japan\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Pleistocene (2.58 million years BCE) glacial cycles, the Japanese islands may have occasionally been connected to the Eurasian Continent via the Korea Strait and the Korean Peninsula or Sakhalin. The Sea of Japan was considered to be a frozen inner lake because of the lack of the warm Tsushima Current. Various plants and large animals, such as the *Palaeoloxodon naumanni* migrated into the Japanese archipelago.[76]\n\n\nThe Sea of Japan was a landlocked sea when the land bridge of East Asia existed circa 18,000 BCE. During the glacial maximum the marine elevation was 200 meters lower than present. Thus Tsushima island in the Korea Strait was a land bridge that connected Kyushu and the southern tip of Honshu with the Korean peninsula. There was still several kilometers of sea to the west of the Ryukyu islands, and most of the Sea of Japan was open sea with a mean depth of 1,752\u00a0m (5,748\u00a0ft). Comparatively, most of the Yellow Sea (Yellow Plane) had a semi-arid climate (dry steppe), because it was relatively shallow with a mean depth of 44\u00a0m (144\u00a0ft). The Korean Peninsula was landlocked on the entire west and south side in the Yellow Plane.[77] The onset of formation of the Japan Arc was in the Early Miocene (23 million years ago).[78] The Early Miocene period was when the Sea of Japan started to open, and the northern and southern parts of the Japanese archipelago separated from each other.[78] The Sea of Japan expanded during the Miocene.[78]\n\n\nThe northern part of the Japanese archipelago was further fragmented until orogenesis of the northeastern Japanese archipelago began in the Late Miocene. The orogenesis of the high mountain ranges in northeastern Japan started in the Late Miocene and lasted in the Pliocene.[78] The south part of the Japanese archipelago remained as a relatively large landmass. The land area expanded northward during the Miocene.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vegetation during the Last Glacial Maximum period 16,000 BCE\nDuring the advance of the last Ice Age, the world sea level dropped. This dried and closed the exit straits of the Sea of Japan one by one. The deepest, and thus the last to close, was the western channel of the Korea Strait. There is controversy as to whether the Sea of Japan became a huge cold inland lake.[76] The Japanese archipelago had a taiga biome (open boreal woodlands). It was characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces and larches. Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril islands had mammoth steppe biome (steppe-tundra). The vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs and willow shrubs.\n\n\n\n### Present[edit]\n\n\nThe Sea of Japan has a surface area of 978,000\u00a0km2 (378,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), a mean depth of 1,752\u00a0m (5,748\u00a0ft) and a maximum depth of 3,742\u00a0m (12,277\u00a0ft). It has a carrot-like shape, with the major axis extending from southwest to northeast and a wide southern part narrowing toward the north. The coastal length is about 7,600\u00a0km (4,700\u00a0mi) with the largest part (3,240\u00a0km or 2,010\u00a0mi) belonging to Russia. The sea extends from north to south for more than 2,255\u00a0km (1,401\u00a0mi) and has a maximum width of about 1,070\u00a0km (660\u00a0mi).[79]\n\n\nThere are three major basins: the *Yamato Basin* in the southeast, the *Japan Basin* in the north and the *Tsushima Basin* in the southwest.[48] The Japan Basin has an oceanic crust and it is the deepest part of the sea, whereas the Tsushima Basin is the shallowest with depths below 2,300\u00a0m (7,500\u00a0ft). The Yamato Basin and Tsushima Basin have thick ocean crusts.[79] The continental shelves of the sea are wide on the eastern shores along Japan. On the western shores, they are narrow particularly along the Korean and Russian coast, averaging about 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThe geographical location of the Japanese archipelago has defined the Sea of Japan for millions of years. Without the Japanese archipelago it would just be the Pacific Ocean. The term has been the international standard since at least the early 19th century.[80] The International Hydrographic Organization, the international governing body for the naming bodies of water around the world, in 2012 recognized the term \"Sea of Japan\" as the only title for the sea.[81]\n\n\n\n## Ocean currents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ocean currents surrounding the Japanese archipelago: 1. Kuroshio 2. Kuroshio extension 3. Kuroshio countercurrent 4. Tsushima Current 5. Tsugaru Current 6. S\u014dya Current 7. Oyashio 8. Liman Current\nThe Japanese archipelago is surrounded by eight ocean currents.\n\n\n\n* The **Kuroshio** (\u9ed2\u6f6e, *, \"\u304f\u308d\u3057\u304a\"*, \"Black Tide\") is a warm north-flowing ocean current on the west side of the Ryukyu Islands and along the east coast of Kyushu, Shikoku and Honshu. It is a strong western boundary current and part of the North Pacific ocean gyre.\n* The **Kuroshio Current** starts in the east coast of Luzon, Philippines, Taiwan and flows northeastward past Japan, where it merges with the easterly drift of the North Pacific Current.[82] It transports warm, tropical water northward toward the polar region. The Kuroshio extension is a northward continuation of the Kuroshio Current in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The Kuroshio countercurrent flows southward to the east of the Kuroshio current in the Pacific Ocean and Philippine Sea.\n\t+ The winter spawning Japanese Flying Squid are associated with the Kuroshio Current. The eggs and larvae develop during winter in the East China Sea and the adults travel with minimum energy via the Kuroshio Current to the rich northern feeding grounds near northwestern Honshu and Hokkaido.[83]\n* The **Tsushima Current** (\u5bfe\u99ac\u6d77\u6d41, *Tsushima Kairy\u016b*) is a branch of the Kuroshio Current. It flows along the west coast of Kyushu and Honshu into the Sea of Japan.\n* The **Oyashio** (\u89aa\u6f6e, \"Parental Tide\") current is a cold subarctic ocean current that flows southward and circulates counterclockwise along the east coast of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu in the western North Pacific Ocean. The waters of the Oyashio Current originate in the Arctic Ocean and flow southward via the Bering Sea, passing through the Bering Strait and transporting cold water from the Arctic Sea into the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk. It collides with the Kuroshio Current off the eastern shore of Japan to form the North Pacific Current. The nutrient-rich Oyashio is named for its metaphorical role as the parent (\u89aa, **oya**) that provides for and nurtures marine organisms.[84][85]\n* The **Liman Current** is a southward flowing cold ocean current that flows from the Strait of Tartary along the Asian continent in the Sea of Japan.[86]\n* The **Tsugaru Warm Current** (\u6d25\u8efd\u6696\u6d41, *Tsugaru Danry\u016b*) originates when the Tsushima Current is divided in two as it flows through the west entrance of the Tsugaru Strait, and along the La Perouse Strait at the north coast of Hokkaido it becomes the **S\u014dya Warm Current** (\u5b97\u8c37\u6696\u6d41, *S\u014dya Danry\u016b*). The flow rate is 1 to 3 knots. There is a relatively stronger flow in the summer than in the winter.[87]\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy in Japan and Mining in Japan\n\n### Land resources[edit]\n\n\nThere are small deposits of coal, oil, iron and minerals in the Japanese archipelago.[3] Japan is scarce in critical natural resources and has long been heavily dependent on imported energy and raw materials.[3][88] The oil crisis in 1973 encouraged the efficient use of energy.[89] Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[90] In regards to agricultural products, the self-sufficiency rate of most items is less than 100% except for rice. Rice has a 100% food self-sufficiency. This makes it difficult to meet Japan's food demand without imports.\n\n\n\n### Marine resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japan's exclusive economic zones:Japan's EEZ\nJoint regime with Republic of Korea\nEEZ claimed by Japan, disputed by others\n\nThe Exclusive economic zone of Japan has an estimated large quantities of mineral resources such as methane clathrate, natural gas, metallic minerals and rare-earth mineral reserves. Seabed mineral resources such as manganese nodules, cobalt-rich crust and submarine hydrothermal deposits are located at depths over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft).[6] Most of these deep sea resources are unexplored at the seabed. Japan's mining law restricts offshore oil and gas production. There are technological hurdles to mine at such extreme depths and to limit the ecological impact. There are no successful commercial ventures that mine the deep sea yet. So currently there are few deep sea mining projects to retrieve minerals or deepwater drilling on the ocean floor.\n\n\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 40 trillion cubic feet of methane clathrate in the eastern Nankai Trough of Japan.[91] As of 2019, the methane clathrate in the deep sea remains unexploited, because the necessary technology is not established yet. This is why currently Japan has very limited proven reserves like crude oil.\n\n\nThe Kant\u014d region alone is estimated to have over 400 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves. It forms a Minami Kant\u014d gas field in the area spanning Saitama, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Ibaraki, and Chiba prefectures. However, mining is strictly regulated in many areas because it is directly below Tokyo, and is only slightly mined in the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula. In Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, there have been frequent accidents with natural gas that was released naturally from the Minami Kant\u014d gas field.[92]\n\n\nIn 2018, 250\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) south of Minami-Tori-shima at 5,700\u00a0m (18,700\u00a0ft) deep, approximately 16 million tons of rare-earth minerals were discovered by JAMSTEC in collaboration with Waseda University and the University of Tokyo.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Marine life[edit]\n\n\nJapan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch (2014).[3] In 2005, Japan ranked sixth in the world in tonnage of fish caught.[7] Japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000 and 9,864,422 tons in 1980.[94] In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes.[95] In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish.[96] Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.[27]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2011[update], 46.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3% from coal, 21.4% from natural gas, 4.0% from nuclear power and 3.3% from hydropower. Nuclear power is a major domestic source of energy and produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2011[update], down from 24.9 percent the previous year.[97] Following the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster in 2011, the nuclear reactors were shut down. Thus Japan's industrial sector became even more dependent than before on imported fossil fuels. By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants were taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service.[98] Shinzo Abe's government seeks to restart the nuclear power plants that meet strict new safety standards and is emphasizing nuclear energy's importance as a base-load electricity source.[3] In 2015, Japan successfully restarted one nuclear reactor at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima prefecture, and several other reactors around the country have since resumed operations. Opposition from local governments has delayed several restarts that remain pending.\n\n\nReforms of the electricity and gas sectors, including full liberalization of Japan's energy market in April 2016 and gas market in April 2017, constitute an important part of Prime Minister Abe's economic program.[3]\n\n\nJapan has the third largest geothermal reserves in the world. Geothermal energy is being heavily focused on as a source of power following the Fukushima disaster. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is exploring over 40 locations for potential geothermal energy plants.[99]\n\n\nOn 3 July 2018, Japan's government pledged to increase renewable energy sources from 15% to 22\u201324% including wind and solar by 2030. Nuclear energy will provide 20% of the country's energy needs as an emissions-free energy source. This will help Japan meet climate change commitments.[100]\n\n\n\n## National Parks and Scenic Beauty[edit]\n\n\n### National Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake T\u014dya and Sh\u014dwa-shinzan in Shikotsu-T\u014dya National Park\nJapan has 34 National Parks (\u56fd\u7acb\u516c\u5712, *Kokuritsu K\u014den*) and 56 Quasi-National Parks (\u56fd\u5b9a\u516c\u5712, *Kokutei K\u014den*) in 2019. These are designated and managed for protection and sustainable usage by the Ministry of the Environment under the Natural Parks Law (\u81ea\u7136\u516c\u5712\u6cd5) of 1957.[101] The Quasi-National Parks have slightly less beauty, size, diversity, or preservation. They are recommended for ministerial designation and managed by the prefectures under the supervision of the Ministry of the Environment.[102]\n\n\nThe Japanese archipelago has diverse landscapes.[8] For example, the northern part of Hokkaido has a taiga biome.[103] Hokkaido has 22% of Japan's forestland with coniferous trees (Sakhalin fir and Sakhalin spruce) and broad-leaved trees (Japanese oak, birch and Painted maple). The seasonal views change throughout the year.[104] In the south, the Yaeyama Islands are in the subtropics with numerous species of subtropical and tropical plants, and mangrove forests.[105][106] Most natural islands have mountain ranges in the center with coastal plains.\n\n\n\n* List of National Parks of Japan\n* List of National Geoparks in Japan\n* Wildlife Protection Areas in Japan\n* List of Ramsar sites in Japan\n* Cultural Landscapes\n\n\n### Places of Scenic Beauty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ritsurin Garden, Takamatsu, Japan\nThe Places of Scenic Beauty and Natural Monuments are selected by the government via the Agency for Cultural Affairs in order to protect Japan's cultural heritage.[107] As of 2017, there are 1,027 Natural Monuments (\u5929\u7136\u8a18\u5ff5\u7269, *tennen kinenbutsu*) and 410 Places of Scenic Beauty (\u540d\u52dd, *meish\u014d*).

However, its climate varies from cool humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Dfa*/*Dfb*) in the north such as northern Hokkaido, to warm tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Af*) in the south such as the Yaeyama Islands and Minami-Tori-shima.\n\n\n\n### Climate zones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kabira Bay on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture in March\n![](image)Sakura blossoms with Himeji Castle in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture in April\n![](image)Mount Yari, Nagano Prefecture in August\nJapan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.\n\n\n\n* Hokkaido belongs to the humid continental climate, with long, cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation is sparse; however, winter brings large snowfalls of hundreds of inches in areas such as Sapporo and Asahikawa.\n* In the Sea of Japan, the northwest seasonal wind in winter gives heavy snowfall, which south of T\u014dhoku mostly melts before the beginning of spring. In summer, it is a little less rainy than the Pacific area but sometimes experiences extreme high temperatures because of the foehn wind phenomenon.\n* Central Highland: a typical inland climate gives large temperature variations between summers and winters and between days and nights. Precipitation is lower than on the coast because of rain shadow effects.\n* Seto Inland Sea: the mountains in the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions block the seasonal winds and bring mild climate and many fine days throughout the year.\n* Pacific Ocean: the climate varies greatly between the north and the south, but generally winters are significantly milder and sunnier than those of the side that faces the Sea of Japan. Summers are hot because of the southeast seasonal wind. Precipitation is very heavy in the south and heavy in the summer in the north. The climate of the Ogasawara Island chain ranges from a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Cfa*) to tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Aw*) with temperatures being warm to hot all year round.\n* The climate of the Ryukyu Islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Cfa*) in the north to tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Af*) in the south with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very high and is especially affected by the rainy season and typhoons.\n\n\n### Rainfall[edit]\n\n\nJapan is generally a rainy country with high humidity.[27] Because of its wide range of latitude,[27] seasonal winds and different types of ocean currents,[*citation needed*] Japan has a variety of climates, with a latitude range of the inhabited islands from 24\u00b0N \u2013 46\u00b0N, which is comparable to the range between Nova Scotia and The Bahamas in the east coast of North America.[27] Tokyo is between 35\u00b0N \u2013 36\u00b0N, which is comparable to that of Tehran, Athens, or Las Vegas.[27]\n\n\nAs Mount Fuji and the coastal Japanese Alps provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds 900 millimetres (35\u00a0in) annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as 750 millimetres (30\u00a0in) per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures\u2014Hokkaido and Okinawa\u2014are composed entirely of islands.\n\n\n\n### Summer[edit]\n\n\nThe climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia.[27] These air flows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land.[27] There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month.[27] It is followed by hot, sticky weather.[27] Five or six typhoons pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, sometimes resulting in significant damage.[27] Annual precipitation averages between 1,000 and 2,500\u00a0mm (40 and 100\u00a0in) except for the areas such as Kii Peninsula and Yakushima Island which is Japan's wettest place[109] with the annual precipitation being one of the world's highest at 4,000 to 10,000\u00a0mm.[110]\n\n\nMaximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above 25 millimetres (1\u00a0in) of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above 100 millimetres (4\u00a0in) per month throughout the year.\n\n\nMid June to mid July is generally the rainy season in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaid\u014d since the seasonal rain front or *baiu zensen* (\u6885\u96e8\u524d\u7dda) dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching Hokkaido. In Okinawa, the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither everyday nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, typhoons, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.\n\n\n\n### Winter[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Winter with frozen coniferous trees near Mt. Kumano in the Mount Za\u014d range in Miyagi Prefecture\nIn winter, the Siberian High develops over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low develops over the northern Pacific Ocean.[27] The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan, but clear skies to areas fronting on the Pacific.[27]\n\n\nThe warmest winter temperatures are found in the Nanp\u014d and Bonin Islands, which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian continent, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24\u00b0 N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaid\u014d in Kushiro and Nemuro Subprefectures.\n\n\n\n### Sunshine[edit]\n\n\nSunshine, in accordance with Japan's uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the Sichuan Basin or Taipei. Amounts range from about six hours per day in the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kant\u014d Plain to four hours per day on the Sea of Japan coast of Hokkaid\u014d. In December there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.\n\n\n\n### Extreme temperature records[edit]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Japan was 41.1\u00a0\u00b0C (106.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 23 July 2018, an unverified record of 42.7\u00a0\u00b0C was taken in Adachi, Tokyo on 20 July 2004. The high humidity and the maritime influence make temperatures in the 40s rare, with summers dominated by a more stable subtropical monsoon pattern through most of Japan. The lowest was \u221241.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221241.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in Asahikawa on 25 January 1902. However an unofficial \u221241.5\u00a0\u00b0C was taken in Bifuka on 27 January 1931. Mount Fuji broke the Japanese record lows for each month except January, February, March, and December. Record lows for any month were taken as recent as 1984.\n\n\nMinami-Tori-shima has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Aw*) and the highest average temperature in Japan of 25 \u00b0C.[111]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Japan\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 29.7(85.5)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 40.4(104.7)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221241.0(\u221241.8)\n | \u221238.3(\u221236.9)\n | \u221235.2(\u221231.4)\n | \u221227.8(\u221218.0)\n | \u221218.9(\u22122.0)\n | \u221213.1(8.4)\n | \u22126.9(19.6)\n | \u22124.3(24.3)\n | \u221210.8(12.6)\n | \u221219.5(\u22123.1)\n | \u221228.1(\u221218.6)\n | \u221234.2(\u221229.6)\n | \u221241.0(\u221241.8)\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[112] and [113] |\n\n\n\nMonthly temperature ranges\n| Record high temperatures\n | Record low temperatures\n |\n| Month\n | \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location\n | Date\n | \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location\n | Date\n |\n| January | 29.7 | 85.5 | Minami-Tori-shima | 7 January 19549 January 2021 | **\u221241.0** | **\u221241.8** | **Asahikawa, Hokkaido** | **25 January 1902** |\n| February | 29.1 | 84.4 | Ishigaki | 16 February 1898 | \u221238.3 | \u221236.9 | Asahikawa, Hokkaido | 11 February 1902\n |\n| March | 30.4 | 86.7 | Naze | 26 March 1999 | \u221235.2 | \u221231.4 | Obihiro, Hokkaido | 3 March 1895\n |\n| April | 33.7 | 92.7 | Yonago | 28 April 2005 | \u221227.8 | \u221218.0 | Mount Fuji | 3 April 1965\n |\n| May | 39.5 | 103.1 | Saroma | 26 May 2019 | \u221218.9 | \u22122.0 | Mount Fuji | 3 May 1934\n |\n| June | 40.2 | 104.4 | Isesaki | 25 June 2022 | \u221213.1 | 8.4 | Mount Fuji | 2 June 1981\n |\n| July | **41.1** | **106.0** | **Kumagaya, Saitama** | **23 July 2018** | \u22126.9 | 19.6 | Mount Fuji | 4 July 1966\n |\n| August | **41.1** | **106.0** | **Hamamatsu, Shizuoka** | **17 August 2020** | \u22124.3 | 24.3 | Mount Fuji | 25 August 1972\n |\n| September | 40.4 | 104.7 | Sanj\u014d, Niigata | 3 September 2020 | \u221210.8 | 12.6 | Mount Fuji | 23 September 1976\n |\n| October | 36.0 | 96.8 | Sanj\u014d, Niigata | 6 October 2018 | \u221219.5 | \u22123.2 | Mount Fuji | 30 October 1984\n |\n| November | 34.2 | 94.4 | Minami-Tori-shima | 4 November 1953 | \u221228.1 | \u221218.6 | Mount Fuji | 30 November 1970\n |\n| December | 31.6 | 88.9 | Minami-Tori-shima | 5 December 1952 | \u221234.2 | \u221229.6 | Obihiro, Hokkaido | 30 December 1907\n |\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal temperature ranges\n| Record high temperatures\n | Record low temperatures\n |\n| Season\n | \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location\n | Date\n | \u00b0C\n | \u00b0F\n | Location\n | Date\n |\n| Winter | 31.6 | 88.9 | Minami-Tori-shima | 5 December 1952 | **\u221241.0** | **\u221241.8** | **Asahikawa, Hokkaido** | **25 January 1902** |\n| Spring | 39.5 | 103.1 | Saroma, Hokkaido | 26 May 2019 | \u221235.2 | \u221231.4 | Obihiro, Hokkaido | 3 March 1895\n |\n| Summer | **41.1** | **106.0** | **Kumagaya, Saitama****Hamamatsu, Shizuoka** | **23 July 2018****17 August 2020** | \u221213.1 | 8.4 | Mount Fuji | 2 June 1981\n |\n| Autumn | 40.4 | 104.7 | Sanj\u014d, Niigata | 3 September 2020 | \u221228.1 | \u221218.6 | Mount Fuji | 30 November 1970\n |\n\n\n## Population distribution[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Japan\n\nSee also: List of cities in Japan\n\n![](image)A map of Japan's major cities, main towns and selected smaller centers\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million in 2019.[20] It is the eleventh most populous country and second most populous island country in the world.[12] The population is clustered in urban areas on the coast, plains and valleys.[15] In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[114] Japan is an urban society with about only 5% of the labor force working in agriculture. About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific coast of Honshu.[24]\n\n\n81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanp\u014d Islands. Nearly 1 in 3 Japanese people live in the Greater Tokyo Area, and over half live in the Kanto, Kinki, and Chukyo metropolitan areas.[115]\n\n\n\n### Honshu[edit]\n\n\n*Honsh\u016b* (\u672c\u5dde) is the largest island of Japan and the second most populous island in the world. It has a population of 104,000,000 with a population density of 450/km2 (1,200/sq\u00a0mi) (2010).[116] Honshu is roughly 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230\u00a0km (31 to 143\u00a0mi) wide, and the total area is 225,800\u00a0km2 (87,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is the 7th largest island in the world.[117] This makes it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331\u00a0km2 (80,823\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[117]\n\n\nThe Greater Tokyo Area on Honshu is the largest metropolitan area (megacity) in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[118][119] The area is 13,500\u00a0km2 (5,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[120] and has a population density of 2,642 persons/km2.[121]\n\n\n\n### Kyushu[edit]\n\n\n*Kyushu* (\u4e5d\u5dde) is the third largest island of Japan of the five main islands.[11][122] As of 2016[update], Kyushu has a population of 12,970,479 and covers 36,782\u00a0km2 (14,202\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[123] It has the second highest population density of 307.13 persons/km2 (2016).\n\n\n\n### Shikoku[edit]\n\n\n*Shikoku* (\u56db\u56fd) is the second smallest of the five main islands (after Okinawa island), 18,800\u00a0km2 (7,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is located south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. It has the second smallest population of 3,845,534 million (2015)[11][124] and the third highest population density of 204.55 persons/km2.\n\n\n\n### Hokkaido[edit]\n\n\n*Hokkaido* (\u5317\u6d77\u9053) is the second largest island of Japan, and the largest and northernmost prefecture. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu.[125] It has the third largest population of the five main islands with 5,383,579 (2015)[11][116] and the lowest population density with just 64.5 persons/km2 (2016). The island area ranks 21st in the world by area. It is 3.6% smaller than the island of Ireland.\n\n\n\n### Okinawa Prefecture[edit]\n\n\n*Okinawa Prefecture* (\u6c96\u7e04\u770c) is the southernmost prefecture of Japan.[126] It encompasses two thirds of the Ryukyu Islands over 1,000 kilometres (620\u00a0mi) long. It has a population of 1,445,812 (2017) and a density of 662 persons/km2. *Okinawa Island* (\u6c96\u7e04\u672c\u5cf6 or \u6c96\u7e04\u5cf6) is the smallest and most southwestern of the five main islands, 1,206.98\u00a0km2 (466.02\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[11] It has the smallest population of 1,301,462 (2014) and the highest population density of 1083.6 persons/km2.\n\n\n\n### Nanp\u014d Islands[edit]\n\n\n*Nanp\u014d Islands* (\u5357\u65b9\u8af8\u5cf6) are the groups of islands that are located to the south and east of the main islands of the Japanese archipelago. They extend from the Izu Peninsula west of Tokyo Bay southward for about 1,200 kilometres (750\u00a0mi), to within 500 kilometres (310\u00a0mi) of the Mariana Islands. The Nanp\u014d Islands are all administered by Tokyo Metropolis.\n\n\n\n### Taiheiy\u014d Belt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Taiheiy\u014d Belt\nThe Taiheiy\u014d Belt is a megalopolis that includes the Greater Tokyo Area and Keihanshin megapoles. It is almost 1,200\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) long from Ibaraki Prefecture in the northeast to Fukuoka Prefecture in the southwest. Satellite images at night show a dense and continuous strip of light (demarcating urban zones) that delineates the region with overlapping metropolitan areas in Japan.[127] It has a total population of approximately 81,859,345 (2016).\n\n\n\n* Taiheiy\u014d Belt \u2013 includes Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu, Mie, Kyoto, Osaka, Hy\u014dgo, Wakayama, Okayama, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, and \u014cita. (81,859,345 people)[128][129]\n\t+ Greater Tokyo Area \u2013 Part of the larger Kant\u014d region, broadly includes Tokyo and Yokohama. (38,000,000 people)[130]\n\t+ Keihanshin \u2013 Part of the larger Kansai region, includes Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe. (19,341,976 people)[131]\n\n\n### Underwater habitats[edit]\n\n\nThere are plans to build underwater habitats in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently no underwater city is constructed yet. For example, the Ocean Spiral by Shimizu Corporation would have a floating dome 500 meters in diameter with hotels, residential and commercial complexes. It could be 15\u00a0km long. This allows mining of the seabed, research and production of methane from carbon dioxide with micro-organisms.

Borders of Shimoda Treaty (1855) and Treaty of St. Petersburg (1875) shown in red. Currently all islands northeast of Hokkaido are administered by Russia.\nMain article: Kuril Islands dispute\n\nJapan has a longstanding claim of the Southern Kuril Islands (Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islands). These islands were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[137] The Kuril Islands historically belong to Japan.[138] The Kuril Islands were first inhabited by the Ainu people and then controlled by the Japanese Matsumae clan in the Edo Period.[139] The Soviet Union did not sign the San Francisco Treaty in 1951. The U.S. Senate Resolution of April 28, 1952, ratifying of the San Francisco Treaty, explicitly stated that the USSR had no title to the Kurils.[140] This dispute has prevented the signing of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia.\n\n\nGeographically the Kuril Islands are a northeastern extension of Hokkaido. Kunashiri and the Habomai Islands are visible from the northeastern coast of Hokkaido. Japan considers the northern territories (aka Southern Chishima) part of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture.\n\n\n\n## Time zone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japan Standard Time\n\nThere is one time zone in the whole Japanese archipelago. It is 9 hours ahead of UTC.[141] There is no daylight saving time. The easternmost Japanese island Minami-Tori-shima also uses Japan Standard Time while it is geographically 1,848 kilometres (1,148\u00a0mi) southeast of Tokyo and in the UTC+10:00 time zone.\n\n\nSakhalin uses UTC+11:00 even though it is located directly north of Hokkaido. The Northern Territories and the Kuril islands use UTC+11:00 although they are geographically in UTC+10:00\n\n\n\n## Natural hazards[edit]\n\n\n### Earthquakes and tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The aftermath of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami\nSee also: List of earthquakes in Japan\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[142] It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.[143]\n\n\nAs many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 6 are common.[27] Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing slight shaking of buildings.[27] Undersea earthquakes also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from tsunamis (\u6d25\u6ce2).[27]\n\n\nDestructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century.[18] The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[144] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude[145] quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011. It triggered a large tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.[146]\n\n\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake was the largest ever recorded in Japan and is the world's fourth largest earthquake to strike since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Service. It struck offshore about 371 kilometres (231\u00a0mi) northeast of Tokyo and 130 kilometres (81\u00a0mi) east of the city of Sendai, and created a massive tsunami that devastated Japan's northeastern coastal areas. At least 100 aftershocks registering a 6.0 magnitude or higher have followed the main shock. At least 15,000 people died as a result.\n\n\nResearchers found the source of great thrust earthquakes and associated tsunamis in the Greater Tokyo Area at the Izu-Ogasawara Trench.[147] There is a 'trench-trench triple junction' of the oceanic Philippine Sea Plate that underthrusts a continental plate and is being subducted by the Pacific Plate.[147]\n\n\nReclaimed land and man-made islands are particularly susceptible to liquefaction during an earthquake. As a result, there are specific earthquake resistance standards and ground reform work that applies to all construction in these areas. In an area that was possibly reclaimed in the past, old maps and land condition drawings are checked and drilling is carried out to determine the strength of the ground. However this can be very costly, so for a private residential block of land, a Swedish weight sounding test is more common.[38]\n\n\nJapan has become a world leader in research on causes and prediction of earthquakes.[27] The development of advanced technology has permitted the construction of skyscrapers even in earthquake-prone areas.[27] Extensive civil defence efforts focus on training in protection against earthquakes, in particular against accompanying fire, which represents the greatest danger.[27]\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sakurajima eruption on October 3, 2009\nSee also: List of volcanoes in Japan\n\nJapan has 111 active volcanoes. That's 10% of all active volcanoes in the world. Japan has stratovolcanoes near the subduction zones of the tectonic plates. During the 20th century several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific.[18] In 1991, Japan's Unzen Volcano on Kyushu about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) east of Nagasaki, awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit. Beginning in June, repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain's slopes at speeds as high as 200\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph). Unzen erupted in 1792 and killed more than 15,000 people. It is the worst volcanic disaster in the country's recorded history.[148]\n\n\n\nMount Fuji is a dormant stratovolcano that last erupted on 16 December 1707 till about 1 January 1708.[149][150] The H\u014dei eruption of Mount Fuji did not have a lava flow, but it did release some 800\u00a0million cubic metres (28\u00d710~~^~~9\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of volcanic ash. It spread over vast areas around the volcano and reached Edo almost 100 kilometres (60\u00a0mi) away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces.[151] In Edo, the volcanic ash was several centimeters thick.[152] The eruption is rated a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.[153]\n\n![](image)Mount Aso 4 pyroclastic flow and the spread of Aso 4 tephra (90,000 to 85,000 years ago). The pyroclastic flow reached almost the whole area of Kyushu, and volcanic ash was deposited of 15 cm in a wide area from Kyushu to southern Hokkaido.\nThere are three VEI-7 volcanoes in Japan. These are the Aira Caldera, Kikai Caldera and Aso Caldera. These giant caldera are remnants of past eruptions. Mount Aso is the largest active volcano in Japan. 300,000 to 90,000 years ago there were four eruptions of Mount Aso which emitted huge amounts of volcanic ash that covered all of Kyushu and up to Yamaguchi Prefecture.\n\n\n\n* The Aira Caldera is 17 kilometers long and 23\u00a0km wide located in south Kyushu. The city of Kagoshima and the Sakurajima volcano are within the Aira Caldera. Sakurajima is the most active volcano in Japan.[154]\n* The Aso Caldera stretches 25 kilometers north to south and 18 kilometers east to west in Kumamoto Prefecture, Kyushu. It has erupted 4 times: 266,000 and 141,000 years ago with 32 DRE km3 (dense-rock equivalent) each; 130,000 years ago with 96 DRE km3; and 90,000 years ago with 384 DRE km3.[155]\n* The Kikai Caldera is a massive, mostly submerged caldera up to 19 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) in diameter in the \u014csumi Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is the remains of the ancient eruption of a colossal volcano. Kikai Caldera was the source of the Akahoya eruption, one of the largest eruptions during the Holocene (10,000\u00a0years ago to present). About 4,300 BC, pyroclastic flows from that eruption reached the coast of southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b up to 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) away, and ash fell as far as Hokkaid\u014d. The eruption produced about 150\u00a0km\u00b3 of tephra,[156] giving it a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7[157] The J\u014dmon culture of at least southern Kyushu was destroyed, and it took nearly 1,000 years to recover.[158]\n\n\nSurveys by KOBEC (Kobe Ocean-Bottom Exploration Center) confirm that a giant lava dome of 23 cubic kilometers formed after the Kikai Caldera erupted in 4,300 BC. There is a 1% chance of a giant caldera eruption in the Japanese archipelago within the next 100 years. Appropriately 40 cubic kilometers of magma would be released in one burst and cause enormous damage.[159]\n\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by KOBEC of Kobe University, in a worst-case scenario if there is a VEI-7 eruption of the Aso Caldera and if the volcanic ash is carried by westerly winds, then pyroclastic flows would cover the 7 million population near the Aso Caldera within two hours. The pyroclastic flows could reach much of Kyushu. Beyond the pyroclastic area is volcanic ash that falls from the sky. If the volcanic ash continuously flows northward, then the ash fall would make it impossible to live normally in large parts of the main islands of Japan, due to paralysis of traffic and lifelines for a limited period (a few days to 2 weeks) until the eruption subsides. In this scenario, the exception would be eastern and northern Hokkaido (the Ryukyu Islands and southern Nanpo Islands would also be excepted). Professor Yoshiyuki Tatsumi, head of KOBEC told the Mainichi Shimbun \"the probability of a gigantic caldera eruption hitting the Japanese archipelago is 1 percent in the next 100 years\" with a death toll of many tens of millions of people and wildlife.[158] The potential exists for tens of millions of humans and other living beings to die during a VEI-7 volcanic eruption with significant short-term effects on the global climate. Most casualties would occur in Kyushu by the pyroclastic flows. The potential damage of the volcanic ash depends on the Wind direction. If in another scenario, the wind blows in a western or southern direction then the Volcanic ash could affect the East Asian continent or South-East Asia. If the ash flows eastward then it will spread over the Pacific Ocean. Since the Kikai Caldera is submerged, it is unclear how much damage the hot ash clouds would cause if large quantities of volcanic ash stays beneath the ocean surface. The underwater ash would be swept away by ocean currents.\n\n\nPaektu Mountain on the Chinese\u2013North Korean border had a VEI-7 eruption in 946. Paektu Mountain is mainly a threat to the surrounding area in North Korea and Manchuria. The west coast of Hokkaido is about 971.62\u00a0km (603.74\u00a0mi) away. However, a temple in Japan reported \"white ash falling like snow\" on 3 November 946 AD.[160] So strong winds carried the volcanic ash eastward across the Sea of Japan. An average of 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) of ashfall covered about 1,500,000\u00a0km2 (580,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the Sea of Japan and northern Japan (Hokkaido and Aomori Prefecture).[161] It took the ash clouds 1 day or so to reach Hokkaido.[160] The total eruption duration was 4 and half to 14 days (111\u2013333 hours).[162]\n\n\nIn October 2021, large quantities of pumice pebbles from the submarine volcano Fukutoku-Okanoba damaged fisheries, tourism, the environment, 11 ports in Okinawa and 19 ports in Kagoshima prefecture.[163] Clean-up operations took 2\u20133 weeks.[163]\n\n\n\n\n\nVEI 7 eruptions happened in the following locations of Japan.\n| Name\n | Zone\n | Location\n | Event / notes\n | Years ago before 1950 (Approx.)\n | Ejecta volume (Approx.)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Kikai Caldera** |  | Japan, Ryukyu Islands | Akahoya eruption 5,300\u00a0BC\n | 7,300[164] | 170\u00a0km3 |\n| **Aira Caldera** |  | Japan, Ky\u016bsh\u016b | Aira-Tanzawa ash\n | 30,000[164] | 450\u00a0km3 |\n| **Aso Caldera** |  | Japan, Ky\u016bsh\u016b | Aso-4 pyroclastic flow\n | 90,000\n | 600\u00a0km3 |\n| **Mount Aso** |  | Japan, Ky\u016bsh\u016b | Four large eruptions between 300,000 and 90,000 years ago.\n | 300,000\n | 600\u00a0km3 |\n\n\nImproving technology and methods to predict volcano and giant caldera eruptions would help to prepare and evacuate people earlier. Technology is needed to accurately capture the state of the magma chamber that spreads thinly with a thickness of less than several kilometers around the middle of the crust. The underground area of Kyushu must be monitored, because it is a dangerous area with a potential caldera eruption. The most protective measure is to stop the hot ash clouds from spreading and devastating areas near the eruption so that people don't need to evacuate. There are currently no protective measures to minimize the spread of millions of tons of deadly hot ash during a VEI-7 eruption.\n\n\nIn 2018 NASA published a theoretical plan to prevent a volcanic eruption by pumping large quantities of cold water down a borehole into the hydrothermal system of a supervolcano. The water would cool the huge body of magma in the chambers below the volcano so that the liquid magma becomes semi-solid. Thus enough heat could be extracted to prevent an eruption. The heat could be used by a geothermal plant to generate geothermal energy and electricity.[165]\n\n\n\n### Typhoons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Typhoons in Japan\n\nSince recording started in 1951, an average of 2.6 typhoons reached the main islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu and Hokkaido per year. Approximately 10.3 typhoons approach within the 300 kilometer range near the coast of Japan. Okinawa is, due to its geographic location, most vulnerable to typhoons with an average of 7 storms per year. The most destructive was Isewan Typhoon with 5,000 casualties in the Tokai region in September 1959. In October 2004, Typhoon Tokage caused heavy rain in Kyushu and central Japan with 98 casualties. Until the 1960s the death toll was hundreds of people per typhoon. Since the 1960s improvements in construction, flood prevention, high tides detection and early warnings substantially reduced the death toll which rarely exceeds a dozen people per typhoon. Japan also has special search and rescue units to save people in distress.[166]\n\n\nHeavy snowfall during the winter in the snow country regions cause landslides, flooding, and avalanches.\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental issues in Japan\nIn the 2006 environment annual report,[167] the Ministry of Environment reported that current major issues are: global warming and preservation of the ozone layer, conservation of the atmospheric environment, water and soil, waste management and recycling, measures for chemical substances, conservation of the natural environment and the participation in the international cooperation.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of peninsulas of Japan\n* Japanese addressing system\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Countries ranked by Surface area (Sq.

Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia, and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. Jakarta is bordered by two Sundanese provinces: West Java to the south and east; and, since 2000, Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west.\n\n\nJakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. It possesses a province-level status and has a population of 10,679,951 as of mid-2022.[11] Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23\u00a0km2 (255.30\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its metropolitan area covers 9,957.08\u00a0km2 (3,844.45\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi, and has an estimated population of 35\u00a0million as of 2022[update], making it the largest urban area in Indonesia and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index. Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.\n\n\nJakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time, it was the *de facto* capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and is the seat of the ASEAN secretariat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. In 2021, the city's GRP PPP was estimated at US$602.946\u00a0billion.\n\n\nJakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and flooding. Jakarta is sinking up to 17\u00a0cm (6.7\u00a0inches) annually, which has made the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced his agreement with an official study that the capital of Indonesia would be moved from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The Parliament approved the move on 18 January 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nJakarta has been home to multiple settlements. Below is the list of names used during its existence:\n\n\n\n> \n> Sunda Kelapa (397\u20131527)  \n> \n> Jayakarta (1527\u20131619)  \n> \n> ![Dutch East Indies](image) Batavia (1619\u20131942)  \n> \n> ![Indonesia](image) Djakarta (1942\u20131972)  \n> \n> ![Indonesia](image) Jakarta (1972\u2013present)  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nThe name 'Jakarta' is derived from the word *Jayakarta* (Devanagari: \u091c\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924) which is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit \u091c\u092f *jaya* (victorious),[12] and \u0915\u0943\u0924 *krta* (accomplished, acquired),[13] thus *Jayakarta* translates as 'victorious deed', 'complete act' or 'complete victory'. It was named for the Muslim troops of Fatahillah which successfully defeated and drove the Portuguese away from the city in 1527.[14] Before it was called Jayakarta, the city was known as 'Sunda Kelapa'. Tom\u00e9 Pires, a Portuguese apothecary, wrote the name of the city in his magnum opus as *Jacatra* or *Jacarta*[15] during his journey to the East Indies.\n\n\nIn the 17th century, the city was known as *Koningin van het Oosten* (Queen of the Orient), a name that was given for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia's canals, mansions and ordered city layout.[16] After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas.[17] During the Japanese occupation, the city was renamed as **Jakaruta Tokubetsu-shi** (\u30b8\u30e3\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf\u7279\u5225\u5e02, Jakarta Special City).[18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Jakarta\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Jakarta.\n\n### Precolonial era[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sunda Kelapa\n\n![](image)Luso-Sundanese *padr\u00e3o*, a monument with a cross of the Order of Christ, commemorating a treaty between Portugal and Hindu Sunda kingdoms.\nThe north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.[19] The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia.[20] The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital.[21] Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, *Chu-fan-chi*, written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula and western Java (Sunda).[22] The source says the port of Sunda is strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on wooden piles.[23] The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa, (Sundanese: \u1b9e\u1ba5\u1b94\u1baa\u1b93 \u1b8a\u1ba8\u1b9c\u1b95) and by the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.\n\n\nThe first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices.[24] The Sunda Kingdom made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of Demak Sultanate from central Java.[14] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[14] and became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.\n\n\nThrough the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, the British East India Company's first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of British trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682.[25] Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the British merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[24]\n\n\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Batavia, Dutch East Indies and List of colonial buildings and structures in Jakarta\n\n![](image)Batavia around 1780\nWhen relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and the British, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the British fort and forced them to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the city *Batavia* in 1619.\n\n\n\n![](image)The City Hall of Batavia (*Stadhuis van Batavia*), the seat of the governor-general of the VOC in the late 18th century by Johannes Rach c. 1770. The building now houses the Jakarta History Museum, Jakarta Old Town.\nCommercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.[26] At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported cotton, *batik* and clothing worn by Arab communities.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Coat of Arms of Batavia during Dutch colonial era, granted in 1930.\nThe city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. The *Koningsplein*, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913,[28] and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area.[26] By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,[29] including 37,067 Europeans.[30] The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of the town of Meester Cornelis, modern Jatinegara.[31]\n\n\nOn 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured Batavia from Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta (Jakarta Special City (\u30b8\u30e3\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf\u7279\u5225\u5e02, *Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi*), under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### Independence era[edit]\n\n\nFile:MonasConstruction2.jpgOne of the most monumental projects launched by Sukarno was the demolition of government buildings in Merdeka Square to make way for the National Monument.\nAfter World War II ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945,[32] and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta and established their capital in Yogyakarta.\n\n\nAfter securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national capital in 1950.[26] With Jakarta selected to host the 1962 Asian Games, Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture.[33] Projects included a cloverleaf interchange, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new building intended to be the headquarters of CONEFO. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which six top generals were killed, precipitating a violent anti-communist purge which killed at least 500,000 people, including some ethnic Chinese.[34] The event marked the beginning of Suharto's New Order. The first government was led by a mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Soediro until he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor.\n\n\nIn 1966, Jakarta was declared a 'special capital region' (*Daerah Khusus Ibukota*), with a status equivalent to that of a province.[35] Based on law No. 5 of 1974 relating to regional governments, the Jakarta Special Capital Region was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of the country's then 26 provinces.[36] Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as governor from 1966 to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, built hospitals and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects \u2014 some for the benefit of the Suharto family,[37]\u2014 and attempted to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty.[38] Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of Jakarta.[39] The boom ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political manoeuvring.\n\n\nAfter three decades in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions peaked when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces. Four days of riots and violence in 1998 ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings, forcing Suharto to resign.[40] Much of the rioting targeted Chinese Indonesians.[41] In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia.[42] Jemaah Islamiah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005,[26] with another in 2009.[43] In August 2007, Jakarta held its first-ever election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows direct local elections in several areas. Previously, governors were elected by the city's legislative body.[44]\n\n\nDuring the Jokowi presidency, the Government adopted a plan to move Indonesia's capital to East Kalimantan.[45]\n\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, a series of terrorist attacks rocked Jakarta with scenes of multiple suicide bombings and gunfire. In suspicion to its links, the Islamic State, the perpetrator led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Floods in Jakarta, Jakarta Flood Canal, and Giant Sea Wall Jakarta\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Jakarta as seen from the Monas in a full 360-degree view (river flowing from south-west to north-east, left to right)\n\nJakarta covers 661.23\u00a0km2 (255.30\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), the smallest among any Indonesian provinces. However, its metropolitan area covers 6,392\u00a0km2 (2,468\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which extends into the two bordering provinces of West Java and Banten.[46] The Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of North Jakarta\nJakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level,[47] and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23\u00a0km2 (255\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land area and 6,977\u00a0km2 (2,694\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of sea area.[48] The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.\n\n\n\n![](image)The northern part of Jakarta is below sea level, having been built on tidal flats and reclaimed swamp land.\nJakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from \u22122 to 91\u00a0m (\u22127 to 299\u00a0ft) with an average elevation of 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area.[49] Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke River, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River.[50][51] They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts.\n\n\nThese rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.\n\n\nMoreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10\u00a0cm (2.0 to 3.9\u00a0in) each year, and up to 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025.[52] In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2\u00a0km (0.75\u00a0mi) tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city.[53] Nowadays, a 1.2\u00a0km (0.75\u00a0mi), with capacity 60\u00a0m3 (2,100\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.[54] In 2023, the New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking up to 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) annually.[55]\n\n\nEnvironmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the extraction of groundwater, much of it illegal. Furthermore, the government's lack of strict regulation amplifies the issue as many recently built high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories around Jakarta opt for illegally extracting groundwater. In fact, in a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan Thamrin, a busy road lined with skyscrapers and shopping malls, 56 buildings had a groundwater pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally.[56] This could be halted by stopping extraction (as the city of Tokyo has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other sources for water use. Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or limiting groundwater pumping has proven to help cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue.[57] The rivers of Jakarta are highly polluted and currently unsuitable for drinking water.[58]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colonial architecture in Jakarta, List of tallest buildings in Jakarta, and Golden Triangle of Jakarta\n\n![](image)Betawi traditional house at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah\nJakarta has architecturally significant buildings spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch influences.[59] External influences inform the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (*Artocarpus integrifolia*) and comprised three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditional Javanese joglo.[60] Additionally, the number of registered cultural heritage buildings has increased.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Facade of the Museum Bank Indonesia in Kota Tua\nColonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century \u2013 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the Jakarta Old Town and Central Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and Eduard Cuypers designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include Jakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and Ministry of Finance Building, while Cuypers designed Bank Indonesia Museum and Mandiri Museum. In the early 20th century, most buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour of rationalism and modernism, particularly art deco architecture. The elite suburb Menteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating an ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate.[62] These houses were developed by N.V. de Bouwploeg, and established by P.A.J. Moojen.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wisma 46, in post-modernist architecture, also an iconic skyscraper in Jakarta, and tallest in Indonesia from 1996 until 2016.\nAfter independence, the process of nation-building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterial roads, monuments, and government buildings. The National Monument in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as Senayan Sports Stadium. The parliament building features a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts.[63] Built-in 1996, Wisma 46 soars to a height of 262\u00a0m (860\u00a0ft) and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.\n\n\nThe urban construction boom continued during the 21st century. The Golden Triangle of Jakarta is one of the fastest evolving CBD's in the Asia-Pacific region.[64] According to CTBUH and Emporis, there are 88 skyscrapers that reach or exceed 150\u00a0m (490\u00a0ft), which puts the city in the top 10 of world rankings.[65] It has more buildings taller than 150\u00a0metres than any other Southeast Asian or Southern Hemisphere cities.\n\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bundaran HI, a 1960s landmark of Jakarta located at the west end of Menteng District\nMost landmarks, monuments and statues in Jakarta were begun in the 1960s during the Sukarno era, then completed in the Suharto era, while some date from the colonial period. Although many of the projects were completed after his presidency, Sukarno, who was an architect, is credited for planning Jakarta's monuments and landmarks, as he desired the city to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. Among the monumental projects that were built, initiated, and planned during his administration are the National Monument, Istiqlal mosque, the Legislature Building, and the Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also built many nationalistic monuments and statues in the capital city.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Monas, Jakarta's symbol\nThe most famous landmark, which became the symbol of the city, is the 132\u00a0m-tall (433\u00a0ft) obelisk of the National Monument (*Monumen Nasional* or *Monas*) in the centre of Merdeka Square. On its southwest corner stands a Mahabharata-themed Arjuna Wijaya chariot statue and fountain. Further south through Jalan M.H. Thamrin, one of the main avenues, the *Selamat Datang* monument stands on the fountain in the centre of the Hotel Indonesia roundabout. Other landmarks include the Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and the Immanuel Church. The former Batavia Stadhuis, Sunda Kelapa port in Jakarta Old Town is another landmark. The Autograph Tower in Central Jakarta, at 382.9\u00a0metres is the tallest building in Indonesia. The most recent landmark built is the Jakarta International Stadium.\n\n\nSome of the statues and monuments are nationalist, such as the West Irian Liberation Monument, the Tugu Tani, the Youth statue and the Dirgantara Monument. Some statues commemorate Indonesian national heroes, such as the Diponegoro and Kartini statues in Merdeka Square. The Sudirman and Thamrin statues are located on the streets bearing their names. There is also a statue of Sukarno and Hatta at the Proclamation Monument as well as at the entrance to Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport.\n\n\n\n### Parks and lakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Boat ride at Indonesian archipelago lake in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah\nIn June 2011, Jakarta had only 10.5% green open spaces (*Ruang Terbuka Hijau*), although this grew to 13.94%. Public parks are included in public green open spaces.[67] There are about 300 integrated child-friendly public spaces (RPTRA) in the city in 2019.[68] As of 2014, 183 water reservoirs and lakes supported the greater Jakarta area.[69]\n\n\n\n* Merdeka Square (*Medan Merdeka*) is an almost 1\u00a0km2 field housing the symbol of Jakarta, Monas or *Monumen Nasional* (National Monument). Until 2000, it was the world's largest city square. The square was created by Dutch Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1810) and was originally named *Koningsplein* (King's Square). On 10 January 1993, President Soeharto started the beautification of the square. Features include a deer park and 33 trees that represent the 33 provinces of Indonesia.[70]\n* Lapangan Banteng (Buffalo Field) is located in Central Jakarta near Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral, and Jakarta Central Post Office. It covers about 4.5 hectares. Initially, it was called *Waterlooplein* and functioned as a ceremonial square during the colonial period. Colonial monuments and memorials erected on the square during the colonial period were demolished during the Sukarno era. The most notable monument in the square is the *Monumen Pembebasan Irian Barat* (Monument of the Liberation of West Irian). During the 1970s and 1980s, the park was used as a bus terminal. In 1993, the park was again turned into a public space. It became a recreation place for people and now serves as an exhibition place or for other events.[71] 'Jakarta Flona' (*Flora dan Fauna*), a flower and decoration plants and pet exhibition, is held in this park around August annually.\n\n\n![](image)Ancol Gondola\n* Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (Miniature Park of Indonesia), in East Jakarta, has ten mini-parks.\n* Suropati Park is located in Menteng, Central Jakarta. The park is surrounded by Dutch colonial buildings. Taman Suropati was known as *Burgemeester Bisschopplein* during colonial time. The park is circular-shaped with a surface area of 16,322\u00a0m2 (175,690\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Several modern statues were made for the park by artists of ASEAN countries, which contributes to its nickname '*Taman persahabatan seniman ASEAN*' ('Park of the ASEAN artists friendship').[72]\n* Menteng Park was built on the site of the former Persija football stadium. Situ Lembang Park is also located nearby, which has a lake at the centre.\n* Kalijodo Park is the newest park, in Penjaringan subdistrict, with 3.4\u00a0ha (8.4 acres) beside the Krendang River. It formally opened on 22 February 2017. The park is open 24 hours as a green open space (*RTH*) and child-friendly integrated public space (*RPTRA*) and has international-standard skateboard facilities.[73]\n* Muara Angke Wildlife Sanctuary and Angke Kapuk Nature Tourism Park at Penjaringan in North Jakarta.[74]\n* Ragunan Zoo is located in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta. It is the world's third-oldest zoo and the second-largest with the most diverse animal and plant populations.[75]\n* Setu Babakan is a 32-hectare lake surrounded by Betawi cultural village, located at Jagakarsa, South Jakarta.[76] Dadap Merah Park is also found in this area.\n* Ancol Dreamland is the largest integrated tourism area in Southeast Asia. It is located along the bay, at Ancol in North Jakarta.\n* Taman Waduk Pluit/Pluit Lake park and Putra Putri Park at Pluit, North Jakarta.[77]\n* Tebet Honda Park, Puring Park, Mataram Park, Langsat Park, Ayodya Park and Martha Christina Tiahahu Literacy Park in South Jakarta.[78][79]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Jakarta\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 363\n\n\n\n31\n\n24\n | 323\n\n\n\n31\n\n24\n | 191\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 153\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 110\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 75\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 66\n\n\n\n32\n\n24\n | 53\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 61\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 111\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 124\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 196\n\n\n\n31\n\n25\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: BMKG[80] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 14\n\n\n\n87\n\n76\n | 13\n\n\n\n87\n\n76\n | 7.5\n\n\n\n89\n\n76\n | 6\n\n\n\n90\n\n77\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n91\n\n77\n | 3\n\n\n\n91\n\n77\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n90\n\n76\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n91\n\n76\n | 2.4\n\n\n\n91\n\n76\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n91\n\n77\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n90\n\n77\n | 7.7\n\n\n\n89\n\n76\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nJakarta has a tropical monsoon climate (*Am*) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system.

The remaining four months (June to September) constitute the city's drier season, having an average monthly rainfall of less than 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in). August qualifies as the genuine dry season month, as it has less than 60\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in) of rainfall. As across the western part of Java the wet season rainfall peaks in January and February with average monthly rainfall of 297.7\u00a0mm (11.72\u00a0in), and its dry season's low point is in August with a monthly average of 43.2\u00a0mm (1.70\u00a0in).\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Jakarta (Kemayoran) (1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 36.9(98.4)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 36.7(98.1)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 373.3(14.70)\n | 381.4(15.02)\n | 210.4(8.28)\n | 164.1(6.46)\n | 103.2(4.06)\n | 80.4(3.17)\n | 77.7(3.06)\n | 51.5(2.03)\n | 61.0(2.40)\n | 112.2(4.42)\n | 134.8(5.31)\n | 183.3(7.22)\n | 1,933.3(76.11)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm) | 17.5\n | 17.9\n | 14.1\n | 11.5\n | 8.2\n | 6.2\n | 4.8\n | 3.3\n | 4.0\n | 7.4\n | 10.4\n | 12.8\n | 118.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 85\n | 85\n | 83\n | 82\n | 82\n | 81\n | 78\n | 76\n | 75\n | 77\n | 81\n | 82\n | 81\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 84.6\n | 78.9\n | 119.6\n | 129.7\n | 130.4\n | 120.4\n | 148.5\n | 172.3\n | 176.9\n | 153.4\n | 103.0\n | 83.6\n | 1,501.3\n |\n| Source 1: World Meteorological Organization[81] |\n| Source 2: Sistema de Clasificaci\u00f3n Bioclim\u00e1tica Mundial[82]Danish Meteorological Institute (humidity)[83] |\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Jakarta\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average sea temperature \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 28.0(82.0)\n | 28.0(82.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n |\n| Average Ultraviolet index | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 11\n | 10\n | 10\n | 12\n | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 12\n |\n| Source: Weather Atlas[84] |\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jakarta population pyramid in 2021\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 65,000 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1875 | 99,100 | +52.5% |\n| 1880 | 102,900 | +3.8% |\n| 1883 | 97,000 | \u22125.7% |\n| 1886 | 100,500 | +3.6% |\n| 1890 | 105,100 | +4.6% |\n| 1901 | 115,900 | +10.3% |\n| 1905 | 138,600 | +19.6% |\n| 1918 | 234,700 | +69.3% |\n| 1920 | 253,800 | +8.1% |\n| 1925 | 290,400 | +14.4% |\n| 1928 | 311,000 | +7.1% |\n| 1930 | 435,184 | +39.9% |\n| 1940 | 530,000 | +21.8% |\n| 1945 | 600,000 | +13.2% |\n| 1950 | 1,800,000 | +200.0% |\n| 1959 | 2,814,000 | +56.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,678,740 | \u22124.8% |\n| 1961 | 2,906,533 | +8.5% |\n| 1970 | 3,915,406 | +34.7% |\n| 1980 | 6,700,000 | +71.1% |\n| 1985 | 7,900,000 | +17.9% |\n| 1990 | 8,174,756 | +3.5% |\n| 2000 | 8,389,759 | +2.6% |\n| 2010 | 9,625,579 | +14.7% |\n| 2020 | 10,562,088 | +9.7% |\n| 2021 | 10,609,681 | +0.5% |\n| 2022 | 10,679,951 | +0.7% |\n| Note: Census figures (1950 and 1980) cover the actual and projected populations of the largest Asian urban agglomerations.[85] According to the Indonesia Central Bureau of Statistics, 23 per cent of urban residents live in poverty. With a population of 7.9\u00a0million in 1985, Jakarta accounted for 19 per cent of the total Indonesia urban population. [86]Source: [87][88] |\n\nJakarta attracts people from across Indonesia, often in search of employment. The 1961 census showed that 51% of the city's population was born in Jakarta.[89] Inward immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs.[36] Ministry of Home Affairs (*Kemendagri*) tabulates its own data, which has improved since ID card requirements in last decade, lists Jakarta's population at 11,261,595 in yearend 2021.\n\n\nBetween 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled, and during the period 1980\u20131990, the city's population grew annually by 3.7%.[90] The 2010 census counted some 9.58\u00a0million people, well above government estimates.[91] The population rose from 4.5\u00a0million in 1970 to 9.5\u00a0million in 2010, counting only legal residents, while the population of Greater Jakarta rose from 8.2\u00a0million in 1970 to 28.5\u00a0million in 2010. As of 2014, the population of Jakarta stood at 10\u00a0million,[92] with a population density of 15,174 people/km2.[93][94] In 2014, the population of Greater Jakarta was 30\u00a0million, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's overall population.[95] It is predicted to reach 35.6\u00a0million people by 2030 to become the world's biggest megacity.[96] The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010,[97] and 101.3 in 2014.[98]\n\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nEthnic groups in Jakarta\n\n\n\nJavanese (36.17%)\nBetawi (28.29%)\nSundanese (14.61%)\nChinese (6.62%)\nBatak (3.42%)\nMinang (2.85%)\nMalay (0.96%)\nOthers (7.06%)\n\nJakarta is pluralistic and religiously diverse, without a majority ethnic group. As of 2010, 36.17% of the city's population were Javanese, 28.29% Betawi (locally established mixed race, cemented by diverse creole), 14.61% Sundanese, 6.62% Chinese, 3.42% Batak, 2.85% Minangkabau, 0.96% Malays, Indo and others 7.08%.\n\n\n\n![](image)Betawi people are the \"natives\" of Jakarta.\nThe 'Betawi' (*Orang Betawi*, or 'people of Batavia') are immigrant descendants of the old city who became widely recognised as an ethnic group by the mid-19th century. They mostly descend from an eclectic mix of Southeast Asians brought or attracted to meet labour needs.[99] They are thus a creole ethnic group who came from much of Indonesia. Over generations, most have intermarried with one or more ethnicities, especially people of Chinese, Arab and European descent.[100] Most Betawis lived in the fringe zones with few Betawi-majority zones of central Jakarta.[101] It is thus a conundrum for some Javanese people, especially multi-generational Jakarta residents, to identify as either Javanese or Betawi since living in a Betawi-majority district and speaking more of that creole and adapting is a matter of preference for such families.\n\n\nA significant Chinese community has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. They traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, PIK, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta's Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old Chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. As of 2001 they self-identified as being 5.5%, which was thought of as under-reported;[102] this explains the 6.6% figure ten years later.\n\n\nThe Sumatran residents are diverse. According to the 2020 census, roughly 361,000 Batak; 300,960 Minangkabau and 101,370 Malays lived in the city. The number of Batak people has grown in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. Toba Batak is the largest subset in Jakarta.[103] Working Minangkabau in the 1980s in high proportions were well-embedded merchants, artisans, doctors, teachers or journalists.[104][105] Minang merchants are found in traditional markets, such as Tanah Abang and Senen.[106]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nIndonesian is the official and dominant language of Jakarta, while many elderly people speak Dutch or Chinese, depending on their upbringing. English is used for communication, especially in Central and South Jakarta.[107] Each of the ethnic groups uses their mother tongue at home, such as Betawi, Javanese, and Sundanese. The Betawi language is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. It is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Chinese, and Arabic. Over time, many Betawi words and phrases became integrated into Indonesian as Jakartan slang, and is used by most people regardless of their ethnic background.\n\n\nThe Chinese in Jakarta mainly speak Indonesian and English due to a strict language ban during Soeharto's New Order era; older people may be fluent in Hokkien dialect and Mandarin, meanwhile the youngsters are only fluent in Indonesian and English, some educated in Mandarin. With the recent urbanization of Chinese communities from several rural areas in Indonesia, other Chinese dialects have been brought into the Chinese community in Jakarta, such as Hakka, Teochew and Cantonese. Hokkien, which is mainly from Sumatra (Medan, Bagansiapiapi, Batam) is mostly spoken in Northern Jakarta, such as in Pantai Indah Kapuk, Pluit, and Kelapa Gading, meanwhile Hakka and Teochew, which are derived from the Chinese communities in Pontianak and Singkawang, are mainly spoken in West Jakarta, like in Tambora and Grogol Petamburan.\n\n\nThe Batak in Jakarta mostly speak Indonesian, while the older generation tends to speak their native languages, such as Batak Toba, Mandailing, and Karo, depending on which ancestral towns and places in North Sumatra they come from. The Minangkabau mainly speak Minangkabau together with Indonesian.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Jakarta (2022)[108]\n\n\n\nIslam (83.84%)\nProtestantism (8.56%)\nCatholicism (3.89%)\nBuddhism (3.50%)\nHinduism (0.18%)\nConfucianism (0.015%)\nFolk religion (0.004%)\n\nIn 2017, Jakarta's religious composition was distributed over Islam (83.43%), Protestantism (8.63%), Catholicism (4.0%), Buddhism (3.74%), Hinduism (0.19%), and Confucianism (0.01%). About 231 people claimed to follow folk religions.[109]\n\n\nMost *pesantren* (Islamic boarding schools) in Jakarta are affiliated with the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama,[110] modernist organisations mostly catering to a socioeconomic class of educated urban elites and merchant traders. They give priority to education, social welfare programs and religious propagation.[111] Many Islamic organisations have headquarters in Jakarta, including Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesian Ulema Council, Muhammadiyah, Indonesia Institute of Islamic Dawah, and Jaringan Islam Liberal.\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic community has a Metropolis, the Archdiocese of Jakarta that includes West Java as part of the ecclesiastical province. Jakarta also hosts the largest Buddhist adherents in Java Island, where most of the followers are the Chinese. Schools of Buddhism practiced in Indonesia vary, including Therav\u0101da, Mah\u0101y\u0101na, Vajrayana, and Tridharma. The city also has Hindu community, which mainly are from Balinese and Indian people. There is also a Sikh and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith community presence in Jakarta.[112]\n\n\n\n\n* ![Istiqlal Mosque is the largest mosque in Southeast Asia](image)\n\nIstiqlal Mosque is the largest mosque in Southeast Asia\n* ![Immanuel's Church is a Protestant church in Jakarta, It is considered one of the oldest churches in Indonesia](image)\n\nImmanuel's Church is a Protestant church in Jakarta, It is considered one of the oldest churches in Indonesia\n* ![The Jakarta Cathedral, one of the oldest Catholic churches in Jakarta](image)\n\nThe Jakarta Cathedral, one of the oldest Catholic churches in Jakarta\n* ![Aditya Jaya Hindu temple, Rawamangun, East Jakarta](image)\n\nAditya Jaya Hindu temple, Rawamangun, East Jakarta\n* ![Kim Tek Ie, the oldest Confucian-Taoist-Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist (Tridharma) temple in Jakarta](image)\n\nKim Tek Ie, the oldest Confucian-Taoist-Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist (Tridharma) temple in Jakarta\n* ![Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya, the first Therav\u0101da Buddhist temple in Jakarta](image)\n\nVih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya, the first Therav\u0101da Buddhist temple in Jakarta\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Companies of Indonesia\n\n![](image)Bank Indonesia Headquarters\nJakarta GDP share by sector (2022)[113]\n\n\n\nAgriculture (0.08%)\nManufacturing (12.28%)\nOther Industrial (11.71%)\nService (75.93%)\n\nIndonesia is the largest economy of ASEAN, and Jakarta is the economic nerve centre of the Indonesian archipelago. Jakarta's nominal GDP was US$203.702\u00a0billion and PPP GDP was US$602.946\u00a0billion in 2021, which is about 17% of Indonesia's.[114] Jakarta ranked at 21 in the list of *Cities Of Economic Influence Index* in 2020 by CEOWORLD magazine.[115] According to the *Japan Center for Economic Research*, GRP per capita of Jakarta will rank 28th among the 77 cities in 2030 from 41st in 2015, the largest in Southeast Asia.[116] Savills Resilient Cities Index has predicted Jakarta to be within the top 20 cities in the world by 2028.[117][118]\n\n\n\nJakarta's economy depends highly on manufacturing and service sectors such as banking, trading and financial. Industries include electronics, automotive, chemicals, mechanical engineering and biomedical sciences. The head office of Bank Indonesia and Indonesia Stock Exchange are located in the city. Most of the SOEs include Pertamina, PLN, Angkasa Pura, and Telkomsel operate head offices in the city, as do major Indonesian conglomerates, such as Salim Group, Sinar Mas Group, Astra International, Gudang Garam, Kompas-Gramedia, CT Corp, Emtek, and MNC Group. The headquarters of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Indonesian Employers Association are also located in the city. As of 2017, the city is home to six Forbes Global 2000, two Fortune 500 and seven Unicorn companies.[119][120][121]\n\n![](image)SCBD in South JakartaGoogle and Alibaba have regional cloud centers in Jakarta.[122] In 2017, the economic growth was 6.22%.[123] Throughout the same year, the total value of the investment was Rp 108.6\u00a0trillion (US$8\u00a0billion), an increase of 84.7% from the previous year.[124] In 2021, nominal GDP per capita was estimated at Rp 274.710\u00a0million (US$19,199).[114] The most significant contributions to GRDP were by finance, ownership and business services (29%); trade, hotel and restaurant sector (20%), and manufacturing industry sector (16%).[36]\n\n\nThe Wealth Report 2015 by Knight Frank reported that 24 individuals in Indonesia in 2014 had wealth of at least US$1\u00a0billion and 18 live in Jakarta.[125] The cost of living continues to rise. Both land prices and rents have become expensive. Mercer's *2017 Cost of Living Survey* ranked Jakarta as 88th costliest city in the world for expatriates.[126] Industrial development and the construction of new housing thrive on the outskirts, while commerce and banking remain concentrated in the city centre.[127] Jakarta has a bustling luxury property market. Knight Frank, a global real estate consultancy based in London, reported in 2014 that Jakarta offered the highest return on high-end property investment in the world in 2013, citing a supply shortage and a sharply depreciated currency as reasons.[128]\n\n\n\n### Shopping[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of shopping malls in Jakarta\n\n![](image)Grand Indonesia is one of the largest malls in Jakarta.\nAs of 2015, with a total of 550 hectares, Jakarta had the largest shopping mall floor area within a single city.[129][130] Malls include Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia, Sarinah, Plaza Senayan, Senayan City, Pacific Place, Gandaria City, \u00c6ON Mall Jakarta Garden City and Tanjung Barat, Mall Taman Anggrek, Central Park Mall, as well as Pondok Indah Mall.[131] Fashion retail brands in Jakarta include Debenhams at Senayan City and Lippo Mall Kemang Village,[132] Japanese Sogo,[133] Seibu at Grand Indonesia Shopping Town, and French brand, Galeries Lafayette, at Pacific Place.

The city, however, is ranked as the fifth fastest-growing tourist destination among 132 cities according to MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.[138]\n\n\n![](image)*Pantjoran* Chinatown, located at the reclaimed island of Pantai Indah Kapuk housing area that currently became newest attraction place in Jakarta\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council also listed Jakarta as among the top ten fastest-growing tourism cities in the world in 2017[139] and categorised it as an *emerging performer*, which will see a significant increase in tourist arrivals in less than ten years.[140] According to *Euromonitor International's latest Top 100 City Destinations Ranking* of 2019, Jakarta ranked at 57th among 100 most visited cities of the world.[141] Most of the visitors attracted to Jakarta are domestic tourists. As the gateway of Indonesia, Jakarta often serves as a stop-over for foreign visitors on their way to other Indonesian tourist destinations such as Bali, Lombok, Komodo Island and Yogyakarta. Jakarta is trying to attract more international tourist by MICE tourism, by arranging increasing numbers of conventions.[142][143] In 2012, the tourism sector contributed Rp. 2.6\u00a0trillion (US$268.5\u00a0million) to the city's total direct income of Rp. 17.83\u00a0trillion (US$1.45\u00a0billion), a 17.9% increase from the previous year 2011.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities in Indonesia and List of schools in Indonesia\n\n![](image)University of Indonesia\nJakarta is home to numerous educational institutions.

Though Betawi people are an indigenous community of Jakarta, the city's culture represents many languages and ethnic groups, supports differences regarding religion, traditions and linguistics, rather than any single and dominant culture.\n\n\n\n### Arts and festivals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tanjidor music demonstrates European influence\nThe Betawi culture is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming a language island in the surrounding area. Betawi arts have a \"low profile\" in Jakarta, and most Betawi people have moved to the suburbs. The cultures of the Javanese and other Indonesian ethnic groups have a \"higher profile\" than that of the Betawi. There is a significant Chinese influence in Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.\n\n\nSome festivals such as the *Jalan Jaksa Festival*, *Kemang Festival*, *Festival Condet* and *Lebaran Betawi* include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances.[160][161][162] Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran, Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art centre in Cikini, Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in the Plaza Semanggi area, Bentara Budaya Jakarta in the Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in Ancol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.

However, this month-long fair also features entertainment, including arts and music performances by local musicians. Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival (JJF) is one of the largest jazz festivals in the world, the biggest in the Southern hemisphere, and is held annually in March.\n\n\nSeveral foreign art and culture centres in Jakarta promote culture and language through learning centres, libraries and art galleries. These include the Chinese Confucius Institute, the Dutch Erasmus Huis, the British Council, the French Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, the German Goethe-Institut, the Japan Foundation, and the Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Center.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Betawi cuisine\n\n![](image)*Soto Betawi*, mainly consisting of offal in creamy milk or coconut milk soup\nAll varieties of Indonesian cuisine have a presence in Jakarta. The local cuisine is Betawi cuisine, which reflects various foreign culinary traditions.

Many TV stations are analogue PAL, but some are now converting to digital signals using DVB-T2 following a government plan to digital television migration.[192]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Governor of Jakarta\n\n![](image)The Jakarta governor's office at the Jakarta City Hall\nJakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status. The executive branch is headed by an elected governor and a vice governor, while the Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council (Indonesian: *Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta*, DPRD DKI Jakarta) is the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. The Jakarta City Hall at the south of Merdeka Square houses the office of the governor and the vice governor, and serves as the main administrative office.\n\n\nExecutive governance consists of five administrative cities (Indonesian: *Kota Administrasi*), each headed by a mayor (w*alikota)* and one administrative regency (Indonesian: *Kabupaten Administrasi*) headed by a regent (*bupati*). Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent is directly elected, Jakarta's mayors and regents are chosen by the governor. Each city and regency is divided into administrative districts.\n\n\nAside from representatives to the provincial parliament, Jakarta sends 21 delegates to the national lower house parliament. The representatives are elected from Jakarta's three national electoral districts, which also include overseas voters.[193] It also sends 4 delegates, just like other provinces, to the national upper house parliament.\n\n\nThe Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on 14 December 2014 with the goal for smart governance, smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living and a smart environment in the city using the web and various smartphone-based apps.[194]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFile:Gedung Polda Metro Jaya.jpgPolda Metro Jaya at Kebayoran Baru\nThe Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Regional Police (Indonesian: *Polda Metro Jaya*) is the police force that is responsible to maintain law, security, and order for the Jakarta metropolitan area.

Its office is located at Jl. Jenderal Sudirman Kav. 55, Senayan, Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta and their hotline emergency number is 110.\n\n\nThe Jayakarta Military Regional Command (Indonesian: *Komando Daerah Militer Jayakarta*, abbreviated *Kodam Jaya*) is the territorial army of the Indonesian Army, which serves as a defence component for Jakarta and its surrounding areas (Greater Jakarta). It is led by an army Major General with the title of \"Jakarta Military Regional Commander\" (Indonesian: *Panglima Daerah Militer Kodam Jaya*, abbreviated *Pangdam Jaya*). The Jakarta Military Command is located at East Jakarta and oversees several military battalions ready for defending the capital city and its vital installations. It also assists the Jakarta Metropolitan Police during certain tasks, such as supporting security during state visits, VVIP security, and riot control.\n\n\n\n### Municipal finances[edit]\n\n\nThe Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees, among others.[195] The ability of the regional government to respond to Jakarta's many problems is constrained by limited finances.\n\n\nThe provincial government consistently runs a surplus of between 15 and 20% of planned spending, primarily because of delays in procurement and other inefficiencies.[196] Regular under-spending is a matter of public comment.[197] In 2013, the budget was around Rp 50\u00a0trillion ($US5.2\u00a0billion), equivalent to around $US380 per citizen. Spending priorities were on education, transport, flood control, environment and social spending (such as health and housing).[198] Jakarta's regional budget (APBD) was Rp 77.1\u00a0trillion ($US5.92\u00a0billion), Rp 83.2\u00a0trillion ($US6.2\u00a0billion), and Rp 89\u00a0trillion ($US6.35\u00a0billion) for the year of 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.[199][200][201]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the administrative cities (*Kota administratif*) in Jakarta province; the Thousand Islands Regency (to the north) is shown on lower left. Each administrative city is further divided into districts (*Kecamatan*).\nJakarta consists of five *Kota Administratif* (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one *Kabupaten Administratif* (Administrative regency). Each city and regency is divided into districts (*kecamatan*). The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:\n\n\n\n* Central Jakarta (*Jakarta Pusat*) is Jakarta's smallest city and administrative and political centre. It is divided into eight districts. It is characterised by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument (Monas), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and museums.[202]\n* West Jakarta (*Jakarta Barat*) has the city's highest concentration of small-scale industries. It has eight districts. The area includes Jakarta's Chinatown and Dutch colonial landmarks such as the Chinese Langgam building and Toko Merah. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town.[203]\n* South Jakarta (*Jakarta Selatan*), originally planned as a satellite city, is now the location of upscale shopping centres and affluent residential areas. It has ten districts and functions as Jakarta's groundwater buffer,[204] but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Much of the central business district is concentrated in Kebayoran Baru, Setiabudi, a small part in Tebet, Pancoran, Mampang Prapatan, and bordering the Tanah Abang/Sudirman area of Central Jakarta. The area is known as the Jakarta Golden Triangle.\n* East Jakarta (*Jakarta Timur*) territory is characterised by several industrial sectors.[205] Also located in East Jakarta are Taman Mini Indonesia Indah and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport. This city has ten districts.\n* North Jakarta (*Jakarta Utara*) is bounded by the Java Sea. It is the location of Port of Tanjung Priok. Large- and medium-scale industries are concentrated there. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town, which was the centre of VOC trade activity during the colonial era. Also located in North Jakarta is Ancol Dreamland (*Taman Impian Jaya Ancol*), the largest integrated tourism area in Southeast Asia.[206] North Jakarta is divided into six districts.\n\n\nThe only administrative regency (*kabupaten*) of Jakarta is the Thousand Islands (*Kepulauan Seribu*), formerly a district within North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It is of high conservation value because of its unique ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and windsurfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands is speed boats or small ferries.[207]\n\n\n\n\n\nJakarta's cities/municipalities (*Kota Administratif*)\n| KodeWilayah\n | Name of City orRegency\n | Area inkm2 | Pop'n 2010 census[208] | Pop'n 2020 census[209] | Pop'n mid 2022estimate[11] | Pop'n density(per km2)in mid 2021\n | HDI[210] 2021 estimates\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 31.74\n | South Jakarta | 144.94 | 2,062,232 | 2,226,812 | 2,244,623 | 15,487\n | 0.849 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.75\n | East Jakarta | 185.54 | 2,693,896 | 3,037,139 | 3,083,883 | 16,621\n | 0.829 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.71\n | Central Jakarta | 47.56 | 902,973 | 1,056,896 | 1,079,995 | 22,708\n | 0.815 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.73\n | West Jakarta | 124.97 | 2,281,945 | 2,434,511 | 2,448,975 | 19,597\n | 0.817 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.72\n | North Jakarta | 147.46 | 1,645,659 | 1,778,981 | 1,793,550 | 12,162\n | 0.805 (Very High)\n |\n| 31.01\n | Thousand Islands | 10.73 | 21,082 | 27,749 | 28,925 | 2,696\n | 0.721 (High)\n |\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Roads of Jakarta\n\n![KRL](image)\n![MRT](image)\n![LRT](image)\n![Airport rail link](image)\nVarious rail-based means of transport in Jakarta; from top left to right: Commuter rail, MRT, LRT, and Airport rail link\n\n![](image)Jakarta Inner Ring Road.\nThis section is an excerpt from Transport in Jakarta.[edit]\nAs a metropolitan area of about 30 million people, Jakarta has a variety of transport systems.[211] Jakarta was awarded 2021 global Sustainable Transport Award (STA) for integrated public transportation system.[212]\n\n\nThe city prioritized development of road networks, which were mostly designed to accommodate private vehicles.[213] A notable feature of Jakarta's present road system is the toll road network. Composed of an inner and outer ring road and five toll roads radiating outwards, the network provides inner as well as outer city connections. An 'odd-even' policy limits road use to cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates on a particular day as a transitional measure to alleviate traffic congestion until the future introduction of electronic road pricing.\n\n\nThere are many bus terminals in the city, from where buses operate on numerous routes to connect neighborhoods within the city limit, to other areas of Greater Jakarta and to cities across the island of Java. The biggest of the bus terminal is Pulo Gebang Bus Terminal, which is arguably the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia.[214] Main terminus for long distance train services are Gambir and Pasar Senen. Whoosh High-speed railways is connecting Jakarta to Bandung and another one is at the planning stage from Jakarta to Surabaya.\n\n\n\n![](image)A skybridge at CSW-ASEAN TOD\nAs of September 2023, Jakarta's public transport service coverage has reached 86 percent, which is targeted to Increase to 95 percent. Rapid transit in Greater Jakarta consists of TransJakarta bus rapid transit, Jakarta LRT, Jakarta MRT, KRL Commuterline, Jabodebek LRT, and Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link. The city administration is building transit oriented development like Dukuh Atas TOD and CSW-ASEAN TOD in several area across Jakarta to facilitate commuters to transfer between different mode of public transportation.\n\n\nPrivately owned bus systems like Kopaja, MetroMini, Mayasari Bakti and PPD also provide important services for Jakarta commuters with numerous routes throughout the city, many routes are/will replaced/replaced by Minitrans and Metrotrans buses.[215] Pedicabs are banned from the city for causing traffic congestion. Bajaj auto rickshaw provide local transportation in the back streets of some parts of the city. Angkot microbuses also play a major role in road transport of Jakarta. Taxicabs and ojeks (motorcycle taxis) are available in the city. As of January 2023, about 2.6 million people use public transportation daily in Jakarta.[216]\n\n\nThe city administration has undertaken a project to build about 500 kilometers of bicycle lanes. As of June 2021, Jakarta already has 63 kilometers of bicycle lanes, and another 101 kilometers will be added by the end of the year 2021.[217][218]\n\n\nSoekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport (CGK) is the main airport serving the Greater Jakarta area, while Halim Perdanakusuma Airport (HLP) accommodates private and low-cost domestic flights. Other airports in the Jakarta metropolitan area include Pondok Cabe Airport and an airfield on Pulau Panjang, part of the Thousand Island archipelago.\n\n\nIndonesia's busiest and Jakarta's main seaport Tanjung Priok serves many ferry connections to different parts of Indonesia. The old port Sunda Kelapa only accommodate pinisi, a traditional two-masted wooden sailing ship serving inter-island freight service in the archipelago. Muara Angke is used as a public port to Thousand Islands (Indonesia), while Marina Ancol is used as a tourist port.[219]\n\n\nFor payment method in public transportation (for KAI Commuter line, TransJakarta, LRT Jakarta, LRT Jabodebek, MRT Jakarta) already using cashless. Travelers can use Electronic money banking cards. The electronic money cards include those issued, namely:\n\n\n\n* BRIZZI (issued by Bank BRI)\n* TapCash (issued by Bank BNI)\n* e-Money (issued by Bank Mandiri)\n* Flazz (issued by Bank BCA)\n* Jakcard (issued by Bank DKI)\n\n\nThe electronic banking cards is integrated cad can be accepted in KAI Commuter line, TransJakarta, LRT Jakarta, LRT Jabodebek, MRT Jakarta, eToll payment and parking payment. The electronic bank card can be bought in Bank Branch office or in e-commerce.\n\n\nFor the electronic banking card Top Up can be done at:\n\n\n\n* Indomaret Outlet (convenient store).\n* Alfamart Outlet (convenient store).\n* Alfamidi Outlet (convenient store).\n* e-Money Card Vending Machine.\n\nJakarta is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean and there to the Upper Adriatic region.[220][221][222]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Batavia map of Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara)\nTo transform the city into a more livable one, a ten-year *urban regeneration* project was undertaken, for Rp 571\u00a0trillion ($40.5\u00a0billion). The project aimed to develop infrastructure, including the creation of a better integrated public transit system and the improvement of the city's clean water and wastewater systems, housing and flood control systems.[223]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nJakarta has many of the country's best-equipped private and public healthcare facilities. In 2012, the Governor of Jakarta Joko Widodo introduced a universal health care program, the 'Healthy Jakarta Card' (*Kartu Jakarta Sehat*, KJS).[224] In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched a universal health care system called the *Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional* (JKN), which is run by BPJS Kesehatan.[225] KJS is being integrated into JKN,[226] and KJS cards are still valid as of 2018.[227] As of 2021, 85.55% of the people of Jakarta is covered by JKN.[228]\n\n\nGovernment-run hospitals are of a good standard but are often overcrowded. Government-run specialised hospitals include Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, as well as community hospitals and puskesmas. Other options for healthcare services include private hospitals and clinics. The private healthcare sector has seen significant changes, since the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organisations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such as Siloam, Pondok Indah Hospital Group, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Ciputra, Radjak Hospital Group, RS Bunda Group, and Hermina operate in the city.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### Water supply[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\nTwo private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. Eighty per cent of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River, 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the first seven years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005, tariffs were frozen, leading private water companies to cut down on investments.\n\n\nAccording to PALYJA, the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% (1998) to 65% (2010) in the western half of the concession.[232] According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004 but stagnated afterwards.[233] However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005,[234] while another estimated it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011.[235] Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta had a crisis over clean water.[236]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of diplomatic missions in Jakarta\n\n![](image)The Headquarters of ASEAN at Jl. Sisingamangaraja, South Jakarta\nJakarta hosts foreign embassies. Jakarta also serves as the seat of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat and is ASEAN's diplomatic capital.[237]\n\n\nJakarta is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ASEAN Smart Cities Network.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns \u2013 sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Indonesia\n\nJakarta signed sister city agreements with other cities, including Casablanca. To promote friendship between the two cities, the main avenue famous for its shopping and business centres was named after Jakarta's Moroccan sister city. No street in Casablanca is named after Jakarta. However, the Moroccan capital city of Rabat has an avenue named after Sukarno, Indonesia's first president, to commemorate his visit in 1960 and as a token of friendship.[238]\n\n\nJakarta's sister cities are:[239]\n\n\n\n* ![Thailand](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![China](image) Beijing, China\n* ![Germany](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![Morocco](image) Casablanca, Morocco\n* ![State of Palestine](image) East Jerusalem, Palestine\n* ![Vietnam](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![Pakistan](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![Turkey](image) Istanbul, Turkey\n* ![Saudi Arabia](image) Jeddah, Saudi Arabia\n* ![Ukraine](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![United States](image) Los Angeles, United States\n* ![Philippines](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![Mozambique](image) Maputo, Mozambique\n* ![Russia](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![India](image) Mumbai, India\n* ![United States](image) New York, United States\n* ![North Korea](image) Pyongyang, North Korea\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Japan](image) Tokyo, Japan\n\n### Cooperation and friendship[edit]\n\n\nJakarta has established a partnership with Rotterdam, especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity-building and knowledge exchange.[240] This cooperation is mainly because both cities are dealing with similar problems; they lie in low-lying flat plains and are prone to flooding. Additionally, they have both implemented drainage systems involving canals, dams, and pumps vital for both cities for below-sea-level areas.\n\n\nIn addition to its sister cities, Jakarta cooperates with:[239]\n\n\n\n* ![United States](image) Arkansas, United States\n* ![Hungary](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![Australia](image) New South Wales, Australia\n* ![France](image) Paris, France\n* ![Netherlands](image) Rotterdam, Netherlands\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain category: People from Jakarta\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![](image)Jakarta portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Greater Jakarta\n* Betawi people\n* Climate change in Indonesia\n* Geology of Indonesia\n* Java\n* List of tallest buildings in Jakarta\n* Outline of Jakarta\n* Transport in Jakarta\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Presented by \"Plus Jakarta\".\n2. **^** Jakarta is a province-level Capital Special Region comprising five *Kota Administrasi*s (administrative cities/municipalities) and one *Kabupaten Administrasi* (administrative regency).

Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[15] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11\u00a0million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8\u00a0million.[7]\n\n\nDelhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut and YEIDA city in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28\u00a0million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).[8]\n\n\nThe topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic *Mahabharata*; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi. Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib. Delhi was a notable centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire. During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu and Sikh refugees from western Punjab.[17] After independence in 1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of India.\n\n\nDelhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index,[18] and has the second-highest GDP per capita in India (after Goa).[19] Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a chief minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name *Delhi*. One of them is derived from *Dhillu* or *Dilu*, a king who built a city at this location in 50\u00a0BCE and named it after himself.[22][23][24] Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Prakrit word *dhili* (*loose*) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the iron pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved.[24] According to Panjab Notes and Queries, the name of the city at the time of King Prithviraj was *dilpat*, and that *dilpat* and *dilli* are probably derived from the old Hindi word *dil* meaning \"eminence\". The former director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, mentioned that *dilli* later became *dihli/dehli*.[25] Some suggest the coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called *dehliwal*.[26] According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort *dehali*.[27] Some historians believe that *Dhilli* or *Dhillika* is the original name for the city while others believe the name could be a corruption of the Hindustani words *dehleez* or *dehali*\u2014both terms meaning \"threshold\" or \"gateway\"\u2014and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain.[28][29]\n\n\nThe people of Delhi are referred to as *Delhiites* or *Dilliwalas*.[30] The city is referenced in various idioms of the Northern Indo-Aryan languages. Examples include:\n\n\n\n* *Abh\u012b Dill\u012b d\u016br hai* (\u0905\u092d\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0926\u0942\u0930 \u0939\u0948 / \u0627\u0628\u06be\u06cc \u062f\u0644\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u06c1\u06d2) or its Persian version, *Hanuz Dehli dur ast* (\u0647\u0646\u0648\u0632 \u062f\u0647\u0644\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a), literally meaning \"Delhi is still far away\", which is generically said about a task or journey still far from completion.[31][32]\n* *\u0100s-p\u0101s barse, Dill\u012b p\u0101n\u012b tarse* (\u0906\u0938-\u092a\u093e\u0938 \u092c\u0930\u0938\u0947, \u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0938\u0947 / \u0622\u0633 \u067e\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0631\u0633\u06d2\u060c \u062f\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u0633\u06d2), literally meaning \"It pours all around, while Delhi lies parched\". An allusion to the sometimes semi-arid climate of Delhi, it idiomatically refers to situations of deprivation when one is surrounded by plenty.[32]\n\n\nThe form *Delhi*, spelled in the Latin script with the *h* following the *l*, originated under colonial rule and is an alternation of the spelling based on the Urdu name of the city (\u062f\u06c1\u0644\u06cc, *Dehli*).[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Delhi and Old Delhi\n\n### Ancient and Early Medieval Periods[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The walls of the 16th-century Purana Qila built on a mound matching ancient literary descriptions[34] Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi. The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic *Mahabharata* (composed c. 400\u00a0BCE to 200\u00a0CE but describing an earlier time) which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna. According to art historian Catherine B. Asher, the topographical description of the *Mahabharata* matches the area of Purana Qila, a 14th-century\u00a0CE fort of the Delhi sultanate, but the analogy does not go much further. Whereas the *Mahabharata* speaks of a beautifully decorated city with surrounding fortification, the excavations have yielded \"uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE; no signs of a built environment, much fewer fortifications, have been revealed.\"[34]\n\n\nThe earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya period (c. 300\u00a0BCE); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273\u2013235\u00a0BCE) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of several major cities can be found in Delhi. The first of these was in the southern part of present-day Delhi. Tomara Rajput King Anang Pal built the Lal Kot and several temples in 1052\u00a0CE. The Chauhan Rajputs under Vigraharaja IV conquered Lal Kot in the mid-12th century and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.\n\n\n\n### Late Medieval Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Delhi Sultanate\n\n![](image)The Qutub Minar, Delhi\nPrithviraj Chauhan was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori in the second battle of Tarain. Qutb-ud-din Aibak, was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India after Ghori returned to his capital, Ghor. When Ghori died without an heir in 1206\u00a0CE, Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions and laid the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mamluk dynasty. He began construction of the Qutb Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. It was his successor, Iltutmish (1211\u20131236), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India.[22][35] At 72.5\u00a0m (238\u00a0ft), the Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi,[36] was completed during the reign of Sultan Illtutmish in the 13th century. Although its style has some similarities with the Jarkurgan minaret, it is more closely related to the Ghaznavid and Ghurid minarets of Central Asia[37] Razia, daughter of Iltutmish, became the Sultana of Delhi upon the former's death.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFor the next three hundred years, Delhi was ruled by a succession of Turkic and an Afghan, Lodi dynasty. They built several forts and townships that are part of the seven cities of Delhi.[38] Delhi was a major centre of Sufism during this period.[39] The Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi) was overthrown in 1290 by Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji (1290\u20131320). Under the second Khalji ruler, Ala-ud-din Khalji, the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the Narmada River in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325\u20131351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to Daulatabad, Maharashtra in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1351\u20131388), the Delhi Sultanate rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces. Delhi was captured and sacked by Timur in 1398,[40] who massacred 100,000 captive civilian.[41] Delhi's decline continued under the Sayyid dynasty (1414\u20131451), until the sultanate was reduced to Delhi and its hinterland. Under the Afghan Lodi dynasty (1451\u20131526), the sultanate recovered control of Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over Northern India. However, the recovery was short-lived and the sultanate was destroyed in 1526 by Babur, founder of the Mughal dynasty.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Early Modern Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mughal Empire\n\n![Red Fort with the Indian Flag at the centre](image)Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.\nIn 1526, Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan, invaded India and defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra.[22] The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556.[42] Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name *Shahjahanabad*, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the *Old City* or *Old Delhi*.[43]\n\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's influence declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence.[44] In 1737, Maratha forces led by Baji Rao I sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less than three hours against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia. After his invasion, he completely sacked and looted Delhi, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat and humiliation which also left the way open for more invaders to come, including eventually the British.[45][46][47] Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for mercy and granting him the keys of the city and the royal treasury.[48] A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protectors of the Mughal throne in Delhi.[49] The city was sacked again in 1757 by the forces of Ahmad Shah Durrani, although it was not annexed by the Afghan Empire and being its vassal state under the Mughal emperor. Then the Marathas battled and won control of Delhi from the Mughals.[50] By the end of the century, Delhi had also come under control of the Bharatpur State and the Sikh Empire.\n\n\n\n### Colonial Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: British Raj\n\n![](image)British India stamps, inauguration, New Delhi, February 1931\nIn 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of British East India Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Battle of Delhi.[51] During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Delhi fell to the forces of East India Company after a bloody fight known as the Siege of Delhi. The city came under the direct control of the British Government in 1858. It was made a district province of the Punjab.[22] In 1911, it was announced that the capital of British-held territories in India was to be transferred from Calcutta to Delhi.[52] This formally transferred on 12 December 1911.[53]\n\n\nThe name \"New Delhi\" was given in 1927, and the new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931. New Delhi was officially declared as the capital of the Union of India after the country gained independence on 15 August 1947.[54] It has expanded since; the small part of it that was constructed during the British period has come to be informally known as *Lutyens' Delhi*.[55]\n\n\n\n### Partition and post-independence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Khan Market in New Delhi, now a high-end shopping district, was established in 1951 to help refugees of the Partition of India, especially those from the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). It honours Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, chief minister of NWFP during the Partition.[56][57]\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan.[58][59] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.[60][61][62] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013[update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining.[63]\n\n\nThe States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the *Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi*.[1][2] The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[3] The Act gave Delhi its legislative assembly along Civil lines, though with limited powers.[3]\n\n\nDelhi was the primary site in the nationwide anti-Sikh pogroms of 1984, which resulted in the death of around 2,800 people in the city according to government figures, though independent estimates of the number of people killed tend to be higher. The riots were set off by the assassination of Indira Gandhi\u2014the Prime Minister of India at the time\u2014by her Sikh bodyguards.[64]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Parliament of India building in New Delhi was attacked by armed militants, killing six security personnel.[65] India suspected Pakistan-based Jihadist militant groups were behind the attack, which caused a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries.[66] There were further terrorist attacks in Delhi in 2005 and 2008, resulting in a total of 92 deaths.[67][68] In 2020, Delhi witnessed worst communal violence in decades. The riots, caused mainly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims,[69][70] 53 people were killed, two-thirds were Muslims,[71][72][73] and the rest Hindus.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environment of Delhi\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Delhi in April 2016 with river Yamuna in top-right\nDelhi is located in Northern India, at 28\u00b037\u2032N 77\u00b014\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff28.61\u00b0N 77.23\u00b0E\ufeff / 28.61; 77.23. The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318\u00a0m (1,043\u00a0ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\nIn addition to the wetlands formed by the Yamuna river, Delhi continues to retain over 500 ponds (wetlands < 5\u00a0ha (12 acres)), that in turn support considerable number of bird species.[75] Delhi's ponds, despite experiencing ecological deterioration due to garbage dumping and concretisation, supports the largest number of bird species known to be using ponds anywhere in the world.[76] Existing policy in Delhi prevents the conversion of wetlands and, quite inadvertently, has led to the city's ponds becoming invaluable refugia for birds.[75][76]\n\n\nThe National Capital Territory of Delhi covers an area of 1,483\u00a0km2 (573\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), of which 783\u00a0km2 (302\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is designated rural, and 700\u00a0km2 (270\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) urban therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in the country. It has a length of 51.9\u00a0km (32\u00a0mi) and a width of 48.48\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi).[*citation needed*] Delhi is included in India's seismic zone-IV, indicating its vulnerability to major earthquakes.[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate of Delhi\n\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cwa*) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen *BSh*). The warm season lasts from 21 March to 15 June with an average daily high temperature above 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102\u00a0\u00b0F). The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42\u00a0\u00b0C (108\u00a0\u00b0F) and low of 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F).[78] The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). The coldest day of the year is usually witnessed between 16 and 20 January, with an average low of 7\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u00a0\u00b0F) and high of 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F).[78] In early March, the wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly. From April to October the weather is hot. The monsoon arrives at the end of June, along with an increase in humidity.[*citation needed*] The brief, mild winter starts in late November, peaks in January and heavy fog often occurs.[79]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for New Delhi (Safdarjung) 1991\u20132020, extremes 1901\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 45.6(114.1)\n | 47.2(117.0)\n | 46.7(116.1)\n | 45.0(113.0)\n | 42.0(107.6)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 47.2(117.0)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 41.4(106.5)\n | 44.3(111.7)\n | 43.7(110.7)\n | 40.1(104.2)\n | 37.4(99.3)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 32.2(90.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 44.8(112.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 36.5(97.7)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 39.0(102.2)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 4.5(40.1)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22120.6(30.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | \u22120.6(30.9)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 19.1(0.75)\n | 21.3(0.84)\n | 17.4(0.69)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 30.7(1.21)\n | 74.1(2.92)\n | 209.7(8.26)\n | 233.1(9.18)\n | 123.5(4.86)\n | 15.1(0.59)\n | 6.0(0.24)\n | 8.1(0.32)\n | 774.4(30.5)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 1.7\n | 1.5\n | 1.7\n | 1.0\n | 2.7\n | 4.8\n | 9.7\n | 10.2\n | 5.5\n | 0.8\n | 0.4\n | 0.6\n | 40.6\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%) (at 17:30 IST) | 57\n | 46\n | 37\n | 25\n | 28\n | 43\n | 63\n | 68\n | 60\n | 47\n | 52\n | 59\n | 49\n |\n| Average dew point \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 8(46)\n | 11(52)\n | 14(57)\n | 14(57)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 26(79)\n | 25(77)\n | 23(73)\n | 18(64)\n | 14(57)\n | 10(50)\n | 17(62)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 220.1\n | 223.2\n | 248.0\n | 276.0\n | 285.2\n | 219.0\n | 179.8\n | 176.7\n | 219.0\n | 260.4\n | 246.0\n | 220.1\n | 2,773.5\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 8.0\n | 9.2\n | 9.2\n | 7.3\n | 5.8\n | 5.7\n | 7.3\n | 8.4\n | 8.2\n | 7.1\n | 7.6\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours | 10.6\n | 11.2\n | 12.0\n | 12.9\n | 13.6\n | 13.9\n | 13.8\n | 13.1\n | 12.3\n | 11.5\n | 10.7\n | 10.3\n | 12.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 67\n | 71\n | 67\n | 71\n | 68\n | 53\n | 42\n | 44\n | 59\n | 73\n | 77\n | 69\n | 63\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 7\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: India Meteorological Department (sun 1971\u20132000);[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93] Time and Date (dewpoints, 2005\u20132015)[94] Revised Rainfall data[95] |\n| Source 2: Tokyo Climate Center (mean temperatures 1991\u20132020);[96] Weather Atlas (UV Index)[97](Daylight)[98] |\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Environmental issues in Delhi and Air pollution in Delhi\n\n![](image)A dense toxic smog in Delhi blocking out the sun, November 2017\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Delhi was the most polluted[99] city in the world in 2014. In 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database.[100] According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year.[101][102][103] Air quality index is generally moderate (101\u2013200) level between January and September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Very Poor (301\u2013400), Severe (401\u2013500) or Hazardous (500+) levels in three months between October and December,[104][105] due to various factors including stubble burning (a type of biomass burning), fire crackers burning during Diwali and cold weather.[106][107][108] During 2013\u201314, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states.[101][109][110][111] It has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms.[112]\n\n\nRising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women.[113][114] The dense smog and haze during winter results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.[115] According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.[116]\n\n\nIndia's Ministry of Earth Sciences published a research paper in October 2018 attributing almost 41% of PM2.5 air pollution in Delhi to vehicular emissions, 21.5% to dust/fire and 18% to industries.[117] The director of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) alleged that the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) is lobbying \"against the report\" because it is \"inconvenient\" to the automobile industry.[118] Environmentalists have also criticised the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues.[102] In 2014, an environmental panel appealed to India's Supreme Court to impose a 30% cess on diesel cars, but till date no action has been taken to penalise the automobile industry.[119]\n\n\nMost of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it.[110][111] In 2020, annual average PM2.5 in the city stood at 107.6\u00a0\u00b5g/m\u00b3, which is almost 21.5 times the WHO's PM2.5 Guideline (5\u00a0\u00b5g/m\u00b3; set in September 2021).[120] These pollution levels are estimated to reduce the life expectancy of an average person living in Delhi by almost 10.1 years.[120]\n\n\nHowever, as of 2015[update], awareness, particularly among the foreign diplomatic community and high-income Indians, was noticeably increasing.[121] Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution\u2014it has the third-highest quantity of trees among Indian cities;[122] the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses.[123] In 1996, the CSE started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on CNG and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its \"bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives\".[123] The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.[124]\n\n\nHowever, according to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, a rise in the market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.[125][126] According to CSE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi.[127][128]\n\n\n\n## Civic administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Districts of Delhi, Neighbourhoods of Delhi, and List of towns in National Capital Territory of Delhi\n\n![](image)Logo of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi\n![](image)Districts of Delhi\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59\u00a0census towns, and 300\u00a0villages.[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Delhi\nOn the other way, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities.

The Municipal corporation handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located. The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat, and the Supreme Court of India are located in the municipal district of New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.[137][138]\nThe Indian National Congress (Congress) formed all the governments in Delhi until the 1990s, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Madan Lal Khurana, came to power.[139] In 1998, the Congress returned to power under the leadership of Sheila Dikshit, who was subsequently re-elected for 3 consecutive terms. But in 2013, the Congress was ousted from power by the newly formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal forming the government with outside support from the Congress.[140] However, that government was short-lived, collapsing only after 49 days.[141] Delhi was then under President's rule until February 2015.[142] On 10 February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power after a landslide victory, winning 67 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Legislative Assembly.[143]\nOn 8 February 2020, Aam Aadmi Party surged to power in Delhi for a third term, boosted by a massive mandate of 62 seats.[144]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Delhi\n\n![](image)\nThe Khari Baoli market in Old Delhi is one of the oldest and busiest in the city.\n![](image)\nConnaught Place in New Delhi is an important economic hub of the National Capital Region.\n\nDelhi is the largest commercial center in northern India. As of 2016[update] recent estimates of the economy of the Delhi urban area have ranged from $370\u00a0billion to $400\u00a0billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India.[145] The nominal GSDP of the NCT of Delhi for 2016\u201317 was estimated at \u20b96,224 billion (US$75\u00a0billion), 13% higher than in 2015\u201316.[146][147]\n\n\nAs per the Economic survey of Delhi (2005\u20132006), the tertiary sector contributes 70.95% of Delhi's gross SDP followed by secondary and primary sectors with 25.20% and 3.85% contributions, respectively.[148] Delhi's workforce constitutes 32.82% of the population, and increased by 52.52% between 1991 and 2001.[149] Delhi's unemployment rate decreased from 12.57% in 1999\u20132000 to 4.63% in 2003.[149] In December 2004, 636,000 people were registered with various employment exchange programmes in Delhi.[149]\n\n\nIn 2018 the total workforce in national and state governments and the quasi-government sector was 594,000, and the private sector employed 273,000.[150] Key service industries are information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism.[151] Construction, power, health and community services and real estate are also important to the city's economy. Delhi has one of India's largest and fastest growing retail industries.[152] Manufacturing also grew considerably as consumer goods companies established manufacturing units and headquarters in the city. Delhi's large consumer market and the availability of skilled labour has also attracted foreign investment. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 1,440,000 workers and the city had 129,000 industrial units.[153]\n\n\n\n## Utility services[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bhalswa landfill\n\nDelhi's municipal water supply is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). As of June\u00a02005[update], it supplied 650\u00a0million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963\u00a0MGD.[154] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240\u00a0MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.[154] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.[155]  \nIn Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000\u00a0tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.[156] The daily domestic waste water production is 470\u00a0MGD and industrial waste water is 70\u00a0MGD.[157] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.[157]\n\n\nThe city's electricity consumption is about 1,265\u00a0kWh per capita but the actual demand is higher.[158] In Delhi power distribution is managed by TPDDL and BSES Yamuna & BSES Rajdhani since 2002. The Delhi Fire Service runs 43 fire stations that attend about 15,000 fire and rescue calls per year.[159] The state-owned BSNL and private enterprises such as Airtel, Vi, Jio, and provide telephone and cell phone services to the city. Cellular coverage is available in GSM, CDMA, 3G, 4G and 4G+.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Delhi\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n![Shown here is the check-in counter at Terminal 3 of the airport.](image)Indira Gandhi International Airport's immigration counter in Terminal 3[160]\nIndira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the south-west of Delhi, is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic. In 2015\u201316, the airport handled more than 48\u00a0million passengers,[161] making it the busiest airport in India and South Asia. Terminal 3, which cost \u20b996.8 billion (US$1.2\u00a0billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles an additional 37\u00a0million passengers annually.[162] In 2010, IGIA was conferred the 4th best airport award in the world in the 15\u201325\u00a0million category, by Airports Council International. The airport was rated as the *Best airport in the world* in the 25\u201340\u00a0million passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International. Delhi Airport was awarded *The Best Airport in Central Asia* and *Best Airport Staff in Central Asia* at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015.[163][164] Hindon Domestic Airport in Ghaziabad was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the second airport for the Delhi-NCR Region on 8 March 2019.[165] A second international airport open for commercial flights has been suggested either by expansion of Meerut Airport or construction of a new airport in Greater Noida.[166]\nThe Taj International Airport project in Jewar has been approved by the Uttar Pradesh government.[167]\n\n\nThe *Delhi Flying Club*, established in 1928 with two de Havilland Moth aircraft named *Delhi* and *Roshanara*, was based at Safdarjung Airport which started operations in 1929, when it was the Delhi's only airport and the second in India.[168] The airport functioned until 2001; however, in January 2002 the government closed the airport for flying activities because of security concerns following the New York attacks in September 2001. Since then, the club only carries out aircraft maintenance courses and is used for helicopter rides to Indira Gandhi International Airport for VIP including the president and the prime minister.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCompressed natural gas red- and green buses have low floors; orange has standard.[b]\n![](image)\nThe cycle rickshaw and the auto rickshaw are commonly used in Delhi for travelling short distances.\n\nDelhi has the highest road density of 2103\u00a0km/100\u00a0km2 in India.[171] It is connected to other parts of India by five National Highways: NH 1, NH 2, NH 8, NH 10 and NH 24. The Delhi\u2013Mumbai and Delhi\u2013Kolkata prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral start from the city. The majority of the city's roads which are 60\u00a0ft. wide or above are maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD)[172] which is under the jurisdiction of the Government of Delhi while some are maintained by Delhi Development Authority and New Delhi Municipal Council[173] which are under the jurisdiction of the Government of India. Roads and streets less than 60\u00a0ft wide are maintained by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Roads and streets in unauthorised colonies are maintained by the local Member of the Legislative Assembly.[174]\n\n\nBuses are the most popular means of road transport catering to about 60% of Delhi's total demand.[175] Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. In 1998, the Supreme Court of India ruled that all public transport vehicles in Delhi must be fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG) to tackle increasing vehicular pollution.[176] The state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is a major bus service provider which operates the world's largest fleet of CNG-fuelled buses.[177][178] In addition, cluster scheme buses are operated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) with the participation of private concessionaires and DTC.[179][180] In December 2017, the DTC and cluster buses carried over 4.19\u00a0million passengers per day.[181] Kashmiri Gate ISBT, Anand Vihar ISBT and Sarai Kale Khan ISBT are the main bus terminals for outstation buses plying to neighbouring states. Delhi's rapid rate of economic development and population growth has resulted in an increasing demand for transport, creating excessive pressure on the city's transport infrastructure. To meet the transport demand, the State and Union government constructed a mass rapid transit system, including the Delhi Metro.[182] Delhi Bus Rapid Transit System runs between Ambedkar Nagar and Delhi Gate.\n\n\nPersonal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on Delhi roads. As of 2007[update], private vehicles account for 30% of the total demand for transport.[182] Delhi has the highest number of registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in India.[183] Taxis, auto rickshaws, and cycle rickshaws also ply on Delhi roads in large numbers. As of 2008[update], the number of vehicles in the metropolitan region, Delhi NCR, was 11.2\u00a0million (11.2\u00a0million).[184] In 2008, there were 85 cars in Delhi for every 1,000 of its residents.[185] In 2017, the number of vehicles in Delhi city alone crossed the ten million mark with the transport department of Delhi Government putting the total number of registered vehicles at 10,567,712 until 25 May of the year.[186]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A passenger train at the New Delhi railway station. Freight awaits pick up or transportation to other destinations.\nDelhi is a major junction in the Indian railway network and is the headquarters of the Northern Railway. The main railway stations are New Delhi, Old Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar, Delhi Sarai Rohilla and Delhi Cantt.[182] The Delhi Metro, a mass rapid transit system built and operated by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), serves many parts of Delhi and the neighbouring cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida.[187] As of December\u00a02021[update], the metro consists of ten operational lines with a total length of 348.12\u00a0km (216.31\u00a0mi) and 254 stations, and several other lines are under construction.[188] The Phase-I was built at a cost of US$2.3\u00a0billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional \u20b9216 billion (US$2.6\u00a0billion).[189] Phase-II has a total length of 128\u00a0km and was completed by 2010.[190] Delhi Metro completed 10\u00a0years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.[191] In addition to the Delhi Metro, a suburban railway, the Delhi Suburban Railway exists.[192]\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Delhi Metro is widely used in the NCR.\nThe Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in the National Capital Region of India. It is the world's tenth-largest metro system by length of lines. It was India's second modern public transportation system. The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[193] serving 255 stations[c] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31\u00a0mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at the Metro stations. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.\nIt has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi\u2013ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi\u2013ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. The Phase-I of Delhi Metro was built for US$2.3\u00a0billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional \u20b9216 billion (US$2.6\u00a0billion).[189] Phase-II has a total length of 128\u00a0km and was completed by 2010.[190] Delhi Metro completed 10\u00a0years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.[191]\n\n\nAlthough the Delhi Metro was built and is operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation of the governments of India and Delhi, it is under the administrative control of the Indian government's Ministry of Urban Development. Besides the construction and operation of the Delhi Metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail, and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad.\n\n\n\n### Regional Rapid Transit System[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Namo Bharat trainsets in Duhai\nDelhi is also going to be connected with India's first regional rail metro corridor. The first such system Delhi\u2013Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This system has the capacity to run at 180KMph.[196]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ethnic groups in Delhi\n\n![](image)NCT of Delhi population pyramid in 2011\nAccording to the 2011 census of India, the population of the NCT of Delhi is 16,753,235.[197] The corresponding population density was 11,297 persons per km2 with a sex ratio of 866 women per 1000 men, and a literacy rate of 86.34%. In 2004, the birth rate, death rate and infant mortality rate per 1000 population were 20.03, 5.59 and 13.08, respectively.[198] In 2001, the population of Delhi increased by 285,000 as a result of migration and by 215,000 as a result of natural population growth,[198] which made Delhi one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Dwarka Sub City, Asia's largest planned residential area, is located within the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[199] Urban expansion has resulted in Delhi's urban area now being considered as extending beyond the NCT boundaries to incorporate the towns and cities of neighbouring states including Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana, and Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, the total population of which is estimated by the United Nations to be over 28 million. According to the UN this makes Delhi urban area the world's second-largest urban area after Tokyo,[8] although Demographia declares the Jakarta urban area to be the second-largest.[200] The 2011 census provided two figures for urban area population: 16,314,838 within the NCT boundary,[201] and 21,753,486 for the *Extended Urban Area*.[202] The 2021 regional plan released by the Government of India renamed the *Extended Urban Area* from *Delhi Metropolitan Area (DMA)* as defined by the 2001 plan,[203] to *Central National Capital Region (CNCR)*.[203][204] Around 49% of the population of Delhi lives in slums and unauthorised colonies without any civic amenities.[205] The majority of these slums have inadequate provisions to the basic facilities and according to a DUSIB report, almost 22% of the people do open defecation.[206]\n\n\n\n* ![The Birla temple in Delhi with its towers.](image)\n\nThe Hindu Laxminarayan Mandir was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1933.\n* ![The Jama Masjid was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656.](image)\n\nThe Jama Masjid was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656.\n* ![The prayer hall of Sikh Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi which dates to 1783](image)\n\nThe prayer hall of Sikh Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi which dates to 1783\n\n\nReligions in Delhi (2011)\n\n\n\nHinduism (81.68%)\nIslam (12.86%)\nSikhism (3.40%)\nJainism (0.99%)\nChristianity (0.87%)\nBuddhism (0.11%)\nOthers (0.09%)\n\nHinduism is Delhi's predominant religious faith, with 81.68% of Delhi's population, followed by Islam (12.86%), Sikhism (3.40%), Jainism (0.99%), Christianity (0.87%), and Buddhism (0.11%).[207] Other minority religions include Zoroastrianism, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00edsm and Judaism.[208]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious groups in Delhi (1891\u22122011)[e]\n| Religiousgroup\n | 1891[211]:\u200a68 | 1901[212]:\u200a44 | 1911[209]:\u200a20 | 1921[213]:\u200a30 | 1931[214]:\u200a119 | 1941[210]:\u200a80 | 2011[207] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % |\n| Hinduism ![](image) | 108,058\n | 56.11%\n | 114,417\n | 54.86%\n | 121,735\n | 52.28%\n | 325,551\n | 66.65%\n | 400,302[f] | 62.92%\n | 567,264[f] | 61.8%\n | 13,712,100\n | 81.68%\n |\n| Islam ![](image) | 79,238\n | 41.15%\n | 88,460\n | 42.41%\n | 102,476\n | 44.01%\n | 141,758\n | 29.02%\n | 206,960\n | 32.53%\n | 304,971\n | 33.22%\n | 2,158,684\n | 12.86%\n |\n| Jainism ![](image) | 3,256\n | 1.69%\n | 3,266\n | 1.57%\n | 3,531\n | 1.52%\n | 4,698\n | 0.96%\n | 5,345\n | 0.84%\n | 11,287\n | 1.23%\n | 166,231\n | 0.99%\n |\n| Christianity ![](image) | 1,700\n | 0.88%\n | 2,164\n | 1.04%\n | 3,075\n | 1.32%\n | 13,320\n | 2.73%\n | 16,989\n | 2.67%\n | 17,475\n | 1.9%\n | 146,093\n | 0.87%\n |\n| Sikhism ![](image) | 289\n | 0.15%\n | 229\n | 0.11%\n | 1,939\n | 0.83%\n | 2,764\n | 0.57%\n | 6,437\n | 1.01%\n | 16,157\n | 1.76%\n | 570,581\n | 3.4%\n |\n| Zoroastrianism ![](image) | 31\n | 0.02%\n | 35\n | 0.02%\n | 74\n | 0.03%\n | 72\n | 0.01%\n | 126\n | 0.02%\n | 284\n | 0.03%\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| Judaism ![](image) | 6\n | 0%\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 7\n | 0%\n | 17\n | 0%\n | 11\n | 0%\n | 55\n | 0.01%\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| Buddhism ![](image) | 0\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 6\n | 0%\n | 76\n | 0.01%\n | 150\n | 0.02%\n | 18,449\n | 0.11%\n |\n| Others\n | 1\n | 0%\n | 4\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 2\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 296\n | 0.03%\n | 15,803\n | 0.09%\n |\n| Total population\n | 192,579\n | 100%\n | 208,575\n | 100%\n | 232,837\n | 100%\n | 488,452\n | 100%\n | 636,246\n | 100%\n | 917,939\n | 100%\n | 16,787,941\n | 100%\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 50th report of the commissioner for linguistic minorities in India, which was submitted in 2014, Hindi is Delhi's most spoken language, with 80.94% speakers, followed by Punjabi (7.14%), Urdu (6.31%) and Bengali (1.50%). 4.11% of Delhites speak other languages.[215] Hindi is also the official language of Delhi while Urdu and Punjabi have been declared as additional official languages.[215]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of India\n\n![](image)\nTraditional pottery on display in *Dilli Haat*\n![](image)\nPragati Maidan hosts the *World Book Fair* biennially.\n\nDelhi's culture has been influenced by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India. Although a strong Punjabi Influence can be seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot. This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1,200 heritage buildings[216] and 175 monuments as national heritage sites.[217]\n\n\nIn the Old City, the Mughals and the Turkic rulers constructed several architecturally significant buildings, such as the Jama Masjid\u2014India's largest mosque[218] built in 1656[219] and the Red Fort. Three World Heritage Sites\u2014the Red Fort, Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb\u2014are located in Delhi.[220] Other monuments include the India Gate, the Jantar Mantar\u2014an 18th-century astronomical observatory\u2014and the Purana Qila\u2014a 16th-century fortress. The Laxminarayan Temple, Akshardham temple, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith's Lotus Temple and the ISKCON temple are examples of modern architecture. Raj Ghat and associated memorials houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and other notable personalities. New Delhi houses several government buildings and official residences reminiscent of British colonial architecture, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Secretariat, Rajpath, the Parliament of India and Vijay Chowk. Safdarjung's Tomb is an example of the Mughal gardens style. Some regal *havelis* (palatial residences) are in the Old City.[221] Lotus Temple is a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship completed in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it serves as the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent and has become a prominent attraction in the city. The National Museum and National Gallery of Modern Art are some of the largest museums in the country. Other museums in Delhi include the National Museum of Natural History, National Rail Museum and National Philatelic Museum.\n\n\nChandni Chowk, a 17th-century market, is one of the most popular shopping areas in Delhi for jewellery and *Zari* saris.[222] Delhi's arts and crafts include, *Zardozi*[223]\u2014an embroidery done with gold thread[224]\u2014and *Meenakari*[225]\u2014the art of enamelling.\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMore than a quarter of the immigrants in Delhi are from Bihar and neighbouring states. Chhath, a festival of rural Bihar is now popular in Delhi.[226]\n![](image)\nOn Basant Panchmi eve, qawwali singers wearing yellow headbands gather at the dargah of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya to sing verses from Amir Khusrau.[227]\n\nDelhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and *Gandhi Jayanti*. On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength.[228][229] Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is the *Phool Walon Ki Sair*, which takes place in September. Flowers and *pankhe*\u2014fans embroidered with flowers\u2014are offered to the shrine of the 13th-century Sufi saint Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki and the Yogmaya Temple, both situated in Mehrauli.[230]\n\n\nReligious festivals include *Diwali* (the festival of lights), *Mahavir Jayanti*, Guru Nanak's Birthday, *Raksha Bandhan*, *Durga Puja*, *Holi*, *Lohri*, *Chauth*, *Krishna Janmastami*, *Maha Shivratri*, Eid ul-Fitr, *Moharram* and *Buddha Jayanti*.[229] The Qutub Festival is a cultural event during which performances of musicians and dancers from all over India are showcased at night, with the Qutub Minar as a backdrop.[231] Other events such as Kite Flying Festival, International Mango Festival and *Vasant Panchami* (the Spring Festival) are held every year in Delhi. The Auto Expo, Asia's largest auto show,[232] is held in Delhi biennially. The New Delhi World Book Fair, held biennially at the Pragati Maidan, is the second-largest exhibition of books in the world.[233] Delhi is often regarded as the \"Book Capital\" of India because of high readership.[234] India International Trade Fair (IITF), organised by ITPO is the biggest cultural and shopping fair of Delhi which takes place in November each year and is visited by more than 1.5\u00a0million people.[235]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\n![](image)Kitchen, Karim's, Old Delhi, a historic restaurant, estab. 1913[236]\nAs India's national capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food habits of its residents and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents.[237] The dearth of food habits among the city's residents created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as *Kebab*, *biryani*, *tandoori*. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, *dal makhani*, *shahi paneer*, *aloo chaat*, *chaat*, *dahi bhalla*, *kachori*, *gol gappe*, *samosa*, *chole bhature*, *chole kulche*, *gulab jamun*, *jalebi* and *lassi*.[237][238]:\u200a40\u201350,\u200a189\u2013196\n\n\nThe fast living habits of Delhi's people has motivated the growth of street food outlets.[238]:\u200a41 A trend of dining at local *dhabas* is popular among the residents. High-profile restaurants have gained popularity in recent years, among the popular restaurants are the Karim Hotel, the Punjab Grill and Bukhara.[239] The *Gali Paranthe Wali* (the street of fried bread) is a street in Chandni Chowk particularly for food eateries since the 1870s. Almost the entire street is occupied by fast food stalls or street vendors. It has nearly become a tradition that almost every prime minister of India has visited the street to eat *paratha* at least once. Other Indian cuisines are also available in this area even though the street specialises in north Indian food.[238]:\u200a40\u201350[240]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Delhi and List of schools in Delhi\n\n![](image)\nLady Hardinge Medical College pharmacy, 1921\n![](image)\nIndraprastha College for Women, established in 1924\nFile:Building 7 jamia.JPG\nJamia Millia Islamia est. 1920 by M.

The bitter experiences of the refugees at the hands of Islamists in Pakistan encouraged them to support right-wing Hindu parties. ... Trouble began in September (1947) after the arrival of refugees from Pakistan who were determined on revenge and driving Muslims out of properties which they could then occupy. Gandhi in his prayer meetings in Birla House denounced the 'crooked and ungentlemanly' squeezing out of Muslims who left for Pakistan.

But each time they found the gates locked from the inside. For three days, no help came.\u00a0... Since the riots broke out in Delhi at the end of February, the worst religious conflict to engulf the capital in decades, questions have persisted about the role that the Delhi police played in enabling the violence, which was predominately Hindu mobs attacking Muslims. Of the 51 people who died, at least three-quarters were Muslim, and many Muslims are still missing.\n70. **^** Gettleman, Jeffrey; Abi-Habib, Maria (1 March 2020), \"In India, Modi's Policies Have Lit a Fuse\", *The New York Times*, archived from the original on 1 March 2020, retrieved 1 March 2020, This past week, as neighborhoods in India's capital burned and religiously driven bloodletting consumed more than 40 lives, most of them Muslim, India's government was quick to say that the violence was spontaneous\u00a0...

The broader Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon metropolitan city, emerged as the world's fourth largest metropolitan economy in 2014, trailing only Tokyo, New York City, and Los Angeles, hosting more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the Korean government.\n\n\nSeoul's history traces back to 18 BC when it was founded by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. During the Joseon dynasty, Seoul was officially designated as the capital, surrounded by the Fortress Wall of Seoul. In the early 20th century, Seoul was occupied by the Japanese Empire, temporarily renamed \"Gyeongseong.\" The Korean War brought fierce battles, with Seoul changing hands four times and leaving the city mostly in ruins. Nevertheless, the city has since undergone significant reconstruction and rapid urbanization.\n\n\nSeoul was rated Asia's most livable city, with the second-highest quality of life globally according to Arcadis in 2015 and a GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $40,000. 15 *Fortune* Global 500 companies, including industry giants such as Samsung,[9] LG, and Hyundai, are headquartered in the Seoul Capital Area, which has major technology hubs, such as Gangnam and Digital Media City,[10]. Seoul is ranked seventh in the Global Power City Index and the Global Financial Centres Index, and is one of the five leading hosts of global conferences.[11] The city has also hosted major events such as the 1986 Asian Games, the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the 2010 G20 Seoul summit.\n\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\nThe city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (\uc704\ub840\uc131; \u6170\u79ae\u57ce, during the Baekje era), Bukhansangun (\ubd81\ud55c\uc0b0\uad70; \u5317\u6f22\u5c71\u90e1 during the Goguryeo era), Namcheon (\ub0a8\ucc9c; \u5357\u5ddd,[13] during the Silla era), Hanyang (\ud55c\uc591; \u6f22\u967d, during the Northern and Southern States period), Namgyeong(\ub0a8\uacbd; \u5357\u4eac, during Goryeo era), Hanseong (\ud55c\uc131; \u6f22\u57ce, during the Joseon era), and Keij\u014d (\u4eac\u57ce) or Gyeongseong (\uacbd\uc131; \u4eac\u57ce) during Japanese rule.[14]\n\n\nDuring Japan's annexation of Korea, *Hanseong* (\u6f22\u57ce) was renamed *Keij\u014d* (\u4eac\u57ce) by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the Hanja '\u6f22' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word *Han* (\ud55c) meaning \"great\"), which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for \"China\".[15]\n\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (\uc11c\ub77c\ubc8c; \u5f90\u7f85\u4f10), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (\u91d1\u57ce, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u57ce; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u57ce; pinyin: *H\u00e0nch\u00e9ng*) to *Shou'er* (\u9996\u5c14; \u9996\u723e; *Sh\u01d2u'\u011br*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Seoul.\n![](image)The Fortress Wall of Seoul\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSettlement of the Han River area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.[19]\n\n\nSeoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul.[19] There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site.[20] As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century.[21]\n\n\nHowever, according to Samguk Sagi, both Baekje and Silla described the land as frontier border of Baekje, not as the capital region.[22][23] Moreover, Jinheung Taewang Stele found at current day Bukhansan tells that the place was underdeveloped as of 6th century AD,[13] suggesting that the first capital Wiryeseong was not located in or nearby Seoul.\n\n\nIn July or August 553, Silla took the control of the region from Baekje, and the city became a part of newly established Sin Province (\uc2e0\uc8fc; \u65b0\u5dde).[22][23] Sin (\u65b0) has both meaning of \"New\" and \"Silla\", thus literally means New Silla Province.\n\n\nIn November 555, Jinheung Taewang made royal visit to Bukhansan, and inspected the borderline.[24] In 557, Silla abolished Sin Province, and established Bukhansan Province (\ubd81\ud55c\uc0b0\uc8fc; \u5317\u6f22\u5c71\u5dde).[25] The word Hanseong (\ud55c\uc131; \u6f22\u57ce; lit.\u00a0Han Fortress) appears on the stone wall of \"Pyongyang Fortress\", which was presumably built in the mid to late 6th century AD over period of 42 years, located in Pyongyang, while there is no evidence that Seoul had name Hanseong dating the three kingdoms and earlier period.[26][27][28][29][30]\n\n\nIn 568, Jinheung Taewang made another royal visit to the northern border, visited Hanseong, and stayed in Namcheon on his way back to the capital. During his stay, he set Jinheung Taewang Stele, abolished Bukhansan Province, and established Namcheon Province (\ub0a8\ucc9c\uc8fc; \u5357\u5ddd\u5dde; South River Province), appointing the city as the provincial capital.[13][31] Based on the naming system, the actual name of Han River during this time was likely Namcheon (Nam River) itself or should have the word ending with \"cheon\" (\ucc9c; \u5ddd) not \"gang\" (\uac15; \u6c5f) nor \"su\" (\uc218; \u6c34). In addition, \"Bukhansan\" Jinheung Stele clearly states that Silla had possession of Hanseong (modern day Pyongyang), thus Bukhansan has to be located north of Hanseong. Modern day Pyongyang was not Pyongyang, Taedong River was likely Han River, and Bukhansan was not Bukhansan during the three kingdoms period.[13][32] Moreover, Pyongyang was a common noun meaning capital used by Goguryeo and Goryeo dynasties, similar to Seoul.[33]\n\n\nIn 603, Goguryeo attacked Bukhansanseong (\ubd81\ud55c\uc0b0\uc131; \u5317\u6f22\u5c71\u57ce; Bukhan Mountain Fortress), which Silla ended up winning.[34][35] In 604, Silla abolished Namcheon Province, and reestablished Bukhansan Province in order to strengthen the northern border. The city lost its provincial capital position and was put under Bukhansan Province once again.[36] This further proves that Bukhansan was located in the North of modern-day Pyongyang as changing the provincial name and objective would not be required if Bukhansan was located within Seoul.\n\n\nIn the 11th century Goryeo, which succeeded Unified Silla, built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the \"Southern Capital\". It was only from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement.[19]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Seoul created 1825\u20131835 by Kim Jeong-ho and designated National Treasure no 853.\nWhen Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nOriginally, the city was entirely surrounded by a massive circular stone wall to provide its citizens security from wild animals, thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (\ubd81\uc545\uc0b0; \u5317\u5cb3\u5c71), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\nMuch of the development was due to trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean\u2013U.S. owned enterprises.[42] In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, \"The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have been widened, gutters have been covered, roadways broadened. Seoul is within measurable distance of becoming the highest, most interesting and cleanest city in the East.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Japanese annexation of Korea[edit]\n\n\nAfter the annexation treaty in 1910, Japan annexed Korea and renamed the city Gyeongseong (\"Kyongsong\" in Korean and \"Keijo\" in Japanese). Japanese technology was imported, the city walls were removed, some of the gates demolished. Roads became paved and Western-style buildings were constructed. The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of World War II.[19]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a special city in 1949.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Seoul changed hands between the Soviet/Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces four times: falling to the North Koreans in the June 1950 First Battle of Seoul, recaptured by UN forces in the September 1950 Second Battle of Seoul, falling to a combined Chinese/North Korean force in the January 1951 Third Battle of Seoul, and finally being recaptured once more by UN forces in Operation Ripper during the spring of 1951.[44][45] The extensive fighting left the city heavily damaged after the war. The capital was temporarily relocated to Busan.[19] One estimate of the extensive damage states that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, a flood of refugees had entered Seoul during the war, swelling the population of the city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5\u00a0million by 1955.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.[46] From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.[47]\n\n\nUntil 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its *de jure* capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution.[48]\n\n\nSouth Korea's 2019 population was estimated at 51.71 million, and according to the 2018 Population and Housing Census, 49.8% of the population resided in the Seoul metropolitan area. This was up by 0.7% from 49.1% in 2010, showing a distinct trend toward the concentration of the population in the capital.[49] Seoul has become the economic, political and cultural hub of the country,[19] with several Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, SK Holdings, Hyundai, POSCO and LG Group headquartered there.[50]\n\n\nSeoul was the host city of the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics as well as one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\nVarious views of Seoul from the 63 Building in July, 2019\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Han River at sunrise\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25\u00a0km2 (233.69\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u22126\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n\u22123\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n18\n\n8\n | 104\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 130\n\n\n\n28\n\n19\n | 414\n\n\n\n29\n\n22\n | 348\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 142\n\n\n\n26\n\n18\n | 52\n\n\n\n20\n\n11\n | 51\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 23\n\n\n\n4\n\n\u22123\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 0.7\n\n\n\n36\n\n22\n | 1.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n64\n\n46\n | 4.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n56\n | 5.1\n\n\n\n82\n\n66\n | 16\n\n\n\n84\n\n72\n | 14\n\n\n\n86\n\n73\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n79\n\n64\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n68\n\n51\n | 2\n\n\n\n53\n\n38\n | 0.9\n\n\n\n40\n\n26\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nSeoul has a humid continental (K\u00f6ppen: *Dwa*) or humid subtropical climate (*Cwa*, by \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C or 26.6\u00a0\u00b0F isotherm), influenced by the monsoons; there is great variation in temperature and precipitation throughout the year.[51][52] The suburbs of Seoul are generally cooler than the center of Seoul because of the urban heat island effect.[53] Summers are hot and humid, with the East Asian monsoon taking place from June until September. August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9\u00a0\u00b0C (86 and 73\u00a0\u00b0F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104.0\u00a0\u00b0F) at the height of summer. \nWinters are usually cold to freezing with average January high and low temperatures of 2.1 and \u22125.5\u00a0\u00b0C (35.8 and 22.1\u00a0\u00b0F), and are generally much drier than summers, with an average of 24.9\u00a0days of snow annually. Sometimes, temperatures drop dramatically to below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F), and on some occasions as low as \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u00a0\u00b0F) in the mid winter period of January and February.

More than 50 percent of the populations in South Korea are exposed to dangerous levels of fine dust.[59][60]\nAir pollution is a major issue in Seoul.[61][62][63][64] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[65] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2014 was 24 micrograms per cubic meter (1.0\u00d710\u22125\u00a0gr/cu\u00a0ft), which is 2.4 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines[66] for the annual mean PM2.5. The Seoul Metropolitan Government monitors and publicly shares real-time air quality data.[67]\n\n\nSince the early 1960s, the Ministry of Environment has implemented a range of policies and air pollutant standards to improve and manage air quality for its people.[68] The \"Special Act on the Improvement of Air Quality in the Seoul Metropolitan Area\" was passed in December 2003. Its 1st Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2005\u20132014) focused on improving the concentrations of PM10 and nitrogen dioxide by reducing emissions.[69] As a result, the annual average PM10 concentrations decreased from 70.0 \u03bcg/m3 in 2001 to 44.4 \u03bcg/m3 in 2011[70] and 46 \u03bcg/m3 in 2014.[65] As of 2014, the annual average PM10 concentration was still at least twice than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines.[66] The 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2015\u20132024) added PM2.5 and ozone to its list of managed pollutants.[71]\n\n\nAsian dust, emissions from Seoul and in general from the rest of South Korea, as well as emissions from China, all contribute to Seoul's air quality.[62][72] A partnership between researchers in South Korea and the United States is conducting an international air quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) to determine how much each source contributes.[73][*needs update*]\n\n\nBesides air quality, greenhouse gas emissions represent hot issues in South Korea since the country is among top-10 strongest emitters in the world. Seoul is the strongest hotspot of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and according to satellite data, the persistent carbon dioxide anomaly over the city is one of the strongest in the world.[74]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)Seoul City Hall\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government is the local government for Seoul, and is responsible for the administration and provision of various services to the city, including correctional institutions, education, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. It is headed by a mayor and three vice mayors, and is divided into 25 autonomous districts and 522 administrative neighborhoods.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Administrative districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Seoul\n\n![](image)Districts of Seoul\nSeoul is divided into 25 gu (\uad6c; \u5340) (district).[77] The *gu* vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47\u00a0km2 or 3.9 to 18.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and population (from fewer than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa has the most people, while Seocho has the largest area. The government of each gu handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. Each *gu* is divided into \"*dong*\" (\ub3d9; \u6d1e) or neighborhoods. Some gu have only a few dong while others like Jongno District have a very large number of distinct neighborhoods. Gu of Seoul consist of 423 administrative dongs (\ud589\uc815\ub3d9) in total.[77] *Dong* are also sub-divided into 13,787 *tong* (\ud1b5; \u7d71), which are further divided into 102,796 *ban* in total.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul population pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1,021,000 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1960 | 2,361,000 | +8.74% |\n| 1970 | 5,312,000 | +8.45% |\n| 1980 | 8,244,000 | +4.49% |\n| 1990 | 10,518,000 | +2.47% |\n| 2000 | 9,879,000 | \u22120.62% |\n| 2010 | 9,796,000 | \u22120.08% |\n| 2020 | 9,963,000 | +0.17% |\n| source:[78] |\n\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris.[79] As of 2015, the population was 9.86\u00a0million,[80] in 2012, it was 10.44\u00a0million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29\u00a0million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\nAs of 2016, the number of foreigners living in Seoul was 404,037, 22.9% of the total foreign population in South Korea.[83] As of June 2011, 186,631 foreigners were Chinese citizens of Korean ancestry. This was an 8.84% increase from the end of 2010 and a 12.85% increase from June 2010. The next largest group was Chinese citizens who are not of Korean ethnicity; 29,901 of them resided in Seoul. The next highest group consisted of the 9,999 United States citizens who were not of Korean ancestry. The next highest group were Taiwanese citizens, at 8,717.[84]\n\n\nThe two major religions in Seoul are Christianity and Buddhism. Other religions include Muism (indigenous religion) and Confucianism. Seoul is home to one of the world's largest Christian congregations, Yoido Full Gospel Church, which has around 830,000 members.[85] According to the 2015 census, 10.8% of the population follows Buddhism and 35% follows Christianity (24.3% Protestantism and 10.7% Catholicism). 53.6% of the population is irreligious.[86]\n\n\n\nReligion in Seoul (2015)[86]\n\n\n\nNot religious (53.6%)\nProtestantism (24.3%)\nBuddhism (10.8%)\nCatholicism (10.7%)\nOther (0.6%)\n\nSeoul is home to the world's largest modern university founded by a Buddhist Order, Dongguk University.[87] Native Seoulites tend to speak the Gyeonggi dialect of Korean.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of South Korea\n\n![](image)Gangnam Commercial Area\nSeoul is the business and financial hub of South Korea. Although it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area, 48.3 percent of South Korea's bank deposits were held in Seoul in 2003,[88] and the city generated 23 percent of the country's GDP overall in 2012.[89] In 2008 the Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index ranked Seoul No.9.[90] The Global Financial Centres Index in 2015 listed Seoul as the 6th financially most competitive city in the world.[91] The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Seoul 15th in the list of \"Overall 2025 City Competitiveness\" regarding future competitiveness of cities.[92]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional, labor-intensive manufacturing industries have been continuously replaced by information technology, electronics and assembly-type of industries;[93][94] however, food and beverage production, as well as printing and publishing remained among the core industries.[93] Major manufacturers are headquartered in the city, including Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia and SK. Notable food and beverage companies include Jinro, whose soju is the most sold alcoholic drink in the world, beating out Smirnoff vodka;[95] top selling beer producers Hite (merged with Jinro) and Oriental Brewery.[96] It also hosts food giants like Seoul Dairy Cooperative, Nongshim Group, Ottogi, CJ, Orion, Maeil Holdings, Namyang Dairy Products and Lotte.\n\n\n\n### Finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office. Hanhwa is one of the three largest South Korean insurance companies, along with Samsung Life and Gangnam & Kyobo life insurance group.\n\n\n\n### Commerce[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shopping in Seoul\n\n![](image)Myeong-dong is one of the most popular destinations in Seoul.\nThe largest wholesale and retail market in South Korea, the Dongdaemun Market, is located in Seoul.[99] Myeongdong is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Seoul with mid- to high-end stores, fashion boutiques and international brand outlets.[100] The nearby Namdaemun Market, named after the Namdaemun Gate, is the oldest continually running market in Seoul.[101]\n\n\nInsadong is the cultural art market of Seoul, where traditional and modern Korean artworks, such as paintings, sculptures and calligraphy are sold.[102] Hwanghak-dong Flea Market and Janganpyeong Antique Market also offer antique products.[103][104] Some shops for local designers have opened in Samcheong-dong, where numerous small art galleries are located. While Itaewon had catered mainly to foreign tourists and American soldiers based in the city, Koreans now comprise the majority of visitors to the area.[105] The Gangnam district is one of the most affluent areas in Seoul[105] and is noted for the fashionable and upscale Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong areas and the COEX Mall. Wholesale markets include Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market and Garak Market.\n\n\nThe Yongsan Electronics Market is the largest electronics market in Asia. Electronics markets are Gangbyeon station metro line 2 Techno mart, ENTER6 MALL & Shindorim station Technomart mall complex.[106] Times Square is one of Seoul's largest shopping malls, and contains the world's largest permanent 35 mm cinema screen, the CGV Starium.[107]\n\n\nKorea World Trade Center Complex, which comprises COEX mall, congress center, 3 Inter-continental hotels, Business tower (Asem tower), Residence hotel, Casino and City airport terminal was established in 1988 in time for the Seoul Olympics. The 2nd World trade trade center is being planned at Seoul Olympic stadium complex as MICE HUB by Seoul city. Ex-Kepco head office building was purchased by Hyundai motor group with 9billion USD to build 115-storey Hyundai GBC & hotel complex until 2021. Now ex-kepco 25-storey building is under demolition.\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nSeoul has been described as the world's \"most wired city\",[108] ranked first in technology readiness by PwC's *Cities of Opportunity* report.[109] Seoul has a very technologically advanced infrastructure.[110][111]\n\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7\u00a0billion won ($44\u00a0million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n![](image)Bukchon Hanok Village, a traditional Seoul village built during the Joseon era\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun)\nSeoul has many historical and cultural landmarks. In Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site, Gangdong District, neolithic remains were excavated and accidentally discovered by a flood in 1925.[119]\n\n\nUrban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The Joseon dynasty built the \"Five Grand Palaces\" in Seoul\u2014Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Gyeonghuigung\u2014all of which are located in the Jongno and Jung Districts. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997 as an \"outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design\". The main palace, Gyeongbokgung, underwent a large-scale restoration project.[120] The palaces are considered exemplary architecture of the Joseon period. Beside the palaces, Unhyeongung is known for being the royal residence of Regent Daewongun, the father of Emperor Gojong at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\n\nSeoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion. Pungnap Toseong is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River, which is widely believed to be the site of Wiryeseong. Mongchon Toseong is another earthen wall built during the Baekje period that is now located inside the Olympic Park.[20] The Fortress Wall of Seoul was built early in the Joseon dynasty for protection of the city. After many centuries of destruction and rebuilding, about 2\u20443 of the wall remains, as well as six of the original eight gates. These gates include the south gate Namdaemun and the east gate Dongdaemun. Namdaemun was the oldest wooden gate until a 2008 arson attack, and was re-opened after complete restoration in 2013.[121] Located near the gates are the traditional markets and largest shopping center, Namdaemun Market and Dongdaemun Market.\n\n\n\n### Modern architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lotte World Tower\nVarious high-rise office buildings and residential buildings, like the Gangnam Finance Center, the Tower Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, and the Lotte World Tower, dominate the city's skyline. The tallest building is Lotte World Tower, reaching a height of 555m. It opened to the public in April 2017. It is also the 6th highest building in the world.\n\n\nThe World Trade Center Seoul, located in Gangnam District, hosts various expositions and conferences. Also in Gangnam District is the COEX Mall, a large indoor shopping and entertainment complex.

Its system dates back to the era of the Korean Empire, when the first streetcar lines were laid and a railroad linking Seoul and Incheon was completed.[135] Seoul's most important streetcar line ran along Jongno until it was replaced by Line 1 of the subway system in the early 1970s. Other notable streets in downtown Seoul include Euljiro, Teheranno, Sejongno, Chungmuro, Yulgongno, and Toegyero. There are nine major subway lines stretching for more than 250\u00a0km (155\u00a0mi), with one additional line planned. As of 2010[update], 25% of the population has a commute time of an hour or longer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Buses\n\n![](image)Seoul buses\nSeoul's bus system is operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government (S.M.G.), with four primary bus configurations available servicing most of the city. Seoul has many large intercity/express bus terminals. These buses connect Seoul with cities throughout South Korea. The Seoul Express Bus Terminal, Central City Terminal and Seoul Nambu Terminal are located in the district of Seocho District. In addition, East Seoul Bus Terminal in Gwangjin District and Sangbong Terminal in Jungnang District handles traffics mainly from Gangwon and Chungcheong provinces.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul Station\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Subway\n\nSeoul has a comprehensive urban railway network of 21 rapid transit, light metro and commuter lines that interconnects every district of the city and the surrounding areas of Incheon, Gyeonggi province, western Gangwon province, and northern Chungnam province. With more than 8\u00a0million passengers per day, the subway is one of the busiest subway systems in the world and the largest in the world, with a total track length of 940\u00a0km (580\u00a0mi). In addition, in order to cope with the various modes of transport, Seoul's metropolitan government employs several mathematicians to coordinate the subway, bus, and traffic schedules into one timetable. The various lines are run by Korail, Seoul Metro, NeoTrans Co. Ltd., AREX, and Seoul Metro Line 9 Corporation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KTX Sancheon\nSeoul is connected to every major city in South Korea by rail. Most major South Korean cities are linked via the KTX high-speed train, which has a normal operation speed of more than 300\u00a0km/h (186\u00a0mph). The Mugunghwa and Saemaeul trains also stop at all major stations. Major railroad stations include:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Seoul Station, Yongsan District: Gyeongbu line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa-ho)\n* Yongsan station, Yongsan District: Honam line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa), Jeolla/Janghang lines (Saemaul/Mugunghwa)\n* Yeongdeungpo station, Yeongdeungpo District: Gyeongbu/Honam/Janghang lines (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Saemaul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa)\n* Cheongnyangni station, Dongdaemun District: Gyeongchun/Jungang/Yeongdong/Taebaek lines (ITX-Cheongchun/ITX-Saemaeul/Mugunghwa)\n* Suseo station (HSR), Gangnam District: Suseo HSR (SRT)\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSeoul is served by two international airports, Incheon International Airport and Gimpo International Airport.\n\n\nGimpo International Airport opened in 1939 as an airfield for the Japanese Imperial Army and opened for civil aircraft in 1957. Since the opening of Incheon International, Gimpo International handles domestic flights along with some short haul international flights to Tokyo Haneda, Osaka Kansai, Taipei Songshan, Shanghai Hongqiao, and Beijing Capital although flights to Osaka Kansai and Beijing Capital also operate from Incheon International.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon International Airport opened in March 2001 in Yeongjong island. It is now responsible for major international flights. Incheon International Airport is Asia's eighth busiest airport in terms of passengers, the world's fourth busiest airport by cargo traffic, and the world's eighth busiest airport in terms of international passengers in 2014. In 2016, 57,765,397 passengers used the airport. Incheon International Airport opened terminal 2 on 18 January 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon and Gimpo are linked to Seoul by expressway, and to each other by the AREX to Seoul Station. Intercity bus services are available to various destinations around the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nCycling is becoming increasingly popular in Seoul and in the entire country. Both banks of the Han River have cycling paths that run all the way across the city along the river. In addition, Seoul introduced in 2015 a bicycle-sharing system named Ddareungi (and named Seoul Bike in English).[136]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in South Korea and List of universities in Seoul\n\n### Universities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Seoul National University\nSeoul is home to the majority of South Korea's most prestigious universities, including Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University.\n\n\nSeoul ranked 2nd on the QS Best Student Cities 2023.[137]\n\n\n\n### Secondary education[edit]\n\n\nCompulsory education lasts from grade 1\u20139 (six years of elementary school and 3 years of middle school).[138] Students spend six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school.

The only country with a land border to South Korea is North Korea, lying to the north with 238 kilometres (148\u00a0mi) of the border running along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. South Korea is mostly surrounded by water and has 2,413 kilometres (1,499\u00a0mi) of coast line along three seas; to the west is the Yellow Sea (called *Sohae* Korean:\u00a0\uc11c\ud574; Hanja:\u00a0\u897f\u6d77; in South Korea, literally means west sea), to the south is the East China Sea, and to the east is the Sea of Japan (called *Donghae* Korean:\u00a0\ub3d9\ud574; Hanja:\u00a0\u6771\u6d77; in South Korea, literally means east sea). Geographically, South Korea's landmass is approximately 100,032 square kilometres (38,623\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[1] 290 square kilometres (110\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of South Korea are occupied by water. The approximate coordinates are 37\u00b0 North, 128\u00b0 East.\n\n\n\n\n## Land area and borders[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Korean Peninsula\n\n![](image)Satellite image of South Korea.\nThe Korean Peninsula extends southward from the northeast part of the Asian continental landmass. The Japanese islands of Honsh\u016b and Ky\u016bsh\u016b are located some 200\u00a0 km (124\u00a0 mi) to the southeast across the Korea Strait; the Shandong Peninsula of China lies 190 kilometers to the west. The west coast of the peninsula is bordered by the Korea Bay to the north and the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait to the south; the east coast is bordered by the Sea of Japan. The 8,640-kilometer coastline is highly indented. Some 3,579 islands lie adjacent to the peninsula. Most of them are found along the south and west coasts.\n\n\nAfter World War II and before June 25,1950, the line between the two Korean states was the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude. After the Korean War, the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) formed the boundary between the two. The DMZ is a heavily guarded, 4,000-meter-wide strip of land that runs along the demarcation line established by the Korean Armistice Agreement from the east to the west coasts for a distance of 241 kilometers (238 kilometers of that line from the land boundary with North Korea).\n\n\nThe total land area of the peninsula, including the islands, is 223,170 square kilometers. Some 44.8 percent (100 210 square kilometers) of this total, excluding the area within the DMZ, constitutes the territory of the Republic of Korea. The combined territories of North Korea and South Korea are about the same size as the United Kingdom. South Korea alone is about the size of Portugal or Hungary, or the U.S. state of Indiana.[2]\n\n\nThe largest island, Jeju-do, lies off the southwest corner of the peninsula and has a land area of 1,825 square kilometers. Other important islands include Ulleung and Liancourt Rocks in the Sea of Japan and Ganghwa Island at the mouth of the Han River. Although the eastern coastline of South Korea is generally unindented, the southern and western coasts are jagged and irregular. The difference is caused by the fact that the eastern coast is gradually rising, while the southern and western coasts are subsiding.\n\n\n\n## Topography and drainage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Topography of South Korea\n![](image)Earthquake epicenter map in South Korea from Jan 2000 (M2.0 or higher).\nEarly European visitors to Korea remarked that the land resembled \"a sea in a heavy gale\" because of the large number of successive mountain ranges that . The highest mountain peak in South Korea is Hallasan (1,950\u00a0m (6,398\u00a0ft)), which is the cone of a volcanic formation constituting Jeju Island. There are two major mountain ranges within South Korea: the Taebaek Mountains, and the Sobaek Mountains.\n\n\nUnlike Japan or the northern provinces of China, the Korean Peninsula is geologically stable. There are no active volcanoes (aside from Baekdu Mountain on the border between North Korea and China, most recently active in 1903), and there have been no strong earthquakes. Historical records, however, describe volcanic activity on Mount Halla during the Goryeo Dynasty (no having kissits lowlands are the product of mountain erosion. Approximately 30 percent of the area of South Korea consists of lowlands, with the rest consisting of uplands and mountains. The great majority of the lowland area lies along the coasts, particularly the west coast, and along the major rivers. The most important lowlands are the Han River plain around Seoul, the Pyeongtaek coastal plain southwest of Seoul, the Geum River basin, the Nakdong River basin, and the Yeongsan River and the Honam plains in the southwest. A narrow littoral plain extends along the east coast. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,833\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in South Korea, making it the 17th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[3]\n\n\nThe Nakdong is South Korea's longest river (521\u00a0km (324\u00a0mi)). The Han River, which flows through Seoul, is 514\u00a0km (319\u00a0mi) long, and the Geum River is 401\u00a0km (249\u00a0mi) long. Other major rivers include the Imjin, which flows through both North Korea and South Korea and forms an estuary with the Han River; the Bukhan, a tributary of the Han that also flows out of North Korea; and the Somjin. The major rivers flow north to south or east to west and empty into the Yellow Sea or the Korea Strait. They tend to be broad and shallow and to have wide seasonal variations in water flow.\n\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century and especially the period during and after World War II and the Korean War, much of the existing Korean forests were cut down, which led to problems with flooding and soil erosion. Combination of reforestation efforts (e.g. Arbor day was celebrated as a national holiday starting in 1949) and policies designed to reduce the use of firewood as a source of energy (e.g. restriction of inflow of firewood into Seoul and other major cities starting in 1958) helped to spark a recovery in the 1950s.[4] Comprehensive reforestation programs starting in the 1970s and continuing into the late 1990s aided in an acceleration of forest volume increase,[5] and the forest cover reached a peak of 65% of national land area in 1980 as opposed to a low of 35% in 1955.[4]\n\n\nNews that North Korea was constructing a huge multipurpose dam at the base of Geumgangsan (1,638\u00a0m (5,374\u00a0ft)) north of the DMZ caused considerable consternation in South Korea during the mid-1980s. During 1987 the Geumgangsan Dam was a major issue that Seoul sought to raise in talks with Pyongyang. Though Seoul completed a \"Peace Dam\" on the Pukhan River to counteract the potential threat of Pyongyang's dam project before the 1988 Olympics, the North Korean project still was in its initial stages of construction in 1990.\n\n\n**Maritime claims:**\n  \n*territorial sea:*\n12\u00a0nmi (22.2\u00a0km; 13.8\u00a0mi); between 3\u00a0nmi (5.6\u00a0km; 3.5\u00a0mi) and 12\u00a0nmi (22.2\u00a0km; 13.8\u00a0mi) in the Korea Strait\n  \n*contiguous zone:*\n24\u00a0nmi (44.4\u00a0km; 27.6\u00a0mi)\n  \n*exclusive economic zone:*\n200\u00a0nmi (370.4\u00a0km; 230.2\u00a0mi)\n  \n*continental shelf:*\nnot specified\n\n\n**Elevation extremes:**\n  \n*lowest point:*\nSea level 0\u00a0m\n  \n*highest point:*\nHallasan 1,950\u00a0m (6,398\u00a0ft)\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled *Climate of South Korea*. (Discuss) *(December 2022)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate types of South Korea\n![](image)Satellite image of Korean Peninsula on 3 January 2010, before a record snowfall in Seoul\nPart of the East Asian Monsoon region, South Korea has humid continental and humid subtropical climates, with four distinct seasons. The movement of air masses from the Asian continent exerts a greater influence on South Korea's weather than does air movement from the Pacific Ocean. Winters are usually long, cold, and dry, whereas summers are short, hot, and humid. Spring and autumn are pleasant but short in duration. Seoul's mean temperature in January is \u22125 to \u22122.5\u00a0\u00b0C (23.0 to 27.5\u00a0\u00b0F); in July the mean temperature is about 22.5 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (72.5 to 77.0\u00a0\u00b0F). Because of its southern and seagirt location, Jeju Island has warmer and milder weather than other parts of South Korea. Mean temperatures on Jeju range from 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C (36.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in January to 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) in July.\n\n\nThe country generally has sufficient rainfall to sustain its agriculture. Rarely does less than 750 millimeters (29.5\u00a0in) of rainfall fall in any given year; for the most part, rainfall is over 1,000 millimeters (39.4\u00a0in). Amounts of precipitation, however, can vary from year to year. Serious droughts occur about once every eight years, especially in the rice-producing southwestern part of the country. About two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs between June and September.\n\n\nSouth Korea is less vulnerable to typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, the east coast of China, or the Philippines. From one to three typhoons can be expected per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country's generally mountainous terrain.\n\n\nIn September 1984, record floods caused the deaths of 190 people and left 200,000 homeless. This disaster prompted the North Korean government to make an unprecedented offer of humanitarian aid in the form of rice, medicine, clothes, and building materials. South Korea accepted these items and distributed them to flood victims.[6]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for South Korea\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 37.4(99.3)\n | 38.0(100.4)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 41.0(105.8)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 41.0(105.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221232.6(\u221226.7)\n | \u221227.9(\u221218.2)\n | \u221223.0(\u22129.4)\n | \u221214.6(5.7)\n | \u22124.7(23.5)\n | \u22121.7(28.9)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | \u22122.3(27.9)\n | \u22129.9(14.2)\n | \u221218.7(\u22121.7)\n | \u221226.8(\u221216.2)\n | \u221232.6(\u221226.7)\n |\n| Source: [7] |\n\n\n\n| Month\n | Temperature\n | Date\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | 23.6\u00a0\u00b0C (74.5\u00a0\u00b0F) | 7 January 2020 | Jeju City, Jeju Province\n |\n| February | 24.5\u00a0\u00b0C (76.1\u00a0\u00b0F) | 21 February 2004 | Jeju City, Jeju Province\n |\n| March | 28.2\u00a0\u00b0C (82.8\u00a0\u00b0F) | 9 March 2013 | Jeonju, North Jeolla Province\n |\n| April | 33.7\u00a0\u00b0C (92.7\u00a0\u00b0F) | 28 April 2005 | Uljin, North Gyeongsang\n |\n| May | 37.4\u00a0\u00b0C (99.3\u00a0\u00b0F) | 31 May 2014 | Daegu City, Daegu Province\n |\n| June | 38.0\u00a0\u00b0C (100.4\u00a0\u00b0F) | 26 June 1958 | Daegu City, Daegu Province\n |\n| July | 39.9\u00a0\u00b0C (103.8\u00a0\u00b0F) | 27 July 2018 | Uiseong, North Gyeongsang\n |\n| August | 41.0\u00a0\u00b0C (105.8\u00a0\u00b0F) | 1 August 2018 | Hongcheon, Gangwon Province\n |\n| September | 37.5\u00a0\u00b0C (99.5\u00a0\u00b0F) | 1 September 1944 | Daegu City, Daegu Province\n |\n| October | 32.8\u00a0\u00b0C (91.0\u00a0\u00b0F)\n | 1 October 2022\n | Gangneung, Gangwon Province\n |\n| November | 29.4\u00a0\u00b0C (84.9\u00a0\u00b0F)\n | 2 November 2023\n | Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province\n |\n| December | 23.3\u00a0\u00b0C (73.9\u00a0\u00b0F) | 3 December 2018 | Jeju City, Jeju Province\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Month\n | Temperature\n | Date\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | \u221232.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221226.7\u00a0\u00b0F) | 5 January 1981 | Yangpyeong County, Gyeonggi Province\n |\n| February | \u221227.9\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221218.2\u00a0\u00b0F) | 6 February 1969 | Chun Cheon, Gangwon Province\n |\n| March | \u221223.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22129.4\u00a0\u00b0F) | 8 March 1983 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| April | \u221214.6\u00a0\u00b0C (5.7\u00a0\u00b0F) | 2 April 1972 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| May | \u22124.7\u00a0\u00b0C (23.5\u00a0\u00b0F) | 16 May 1977 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| June | \u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0C (28.9\u00a0\u00b0F) | 1 June 2010 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| July | 4.4\u00a0\u00b0C (39.9\u00a0\u00b0F) | 5 July 1976 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| August | 3.3\u00a0\u00b0C (37.9\u00a0\u00b0F) | 27 August 1977 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| September | \u22122.3\u00a0\u00b0C (27.9\u00a0\u00b0F) | 23 September 1980 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| October | \u22129.9\u00a0\u00b0C (14.2\u00a0\u00b0F) | 25 October 1982 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| November | \u221218.7\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0F) | 22 November 1973 | Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang Province\n |\n| December | \u221226.8\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221216.2\u00a0\u00b0F) | 24 December 1973 | Wonju, Gangwon Province\n |\n\n\n### Rainy season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: East Asian rainy season\n\nThe rainy season of South Korea refers to a phenomenon in which it rains continuously for several days in summer or rainy season, or the weather, or the rain itself. On average, the rainy season is 30 to 35 days, but it does not continue to rain during this period. In fact, it rains for about 15 to 20 days, and among them, it falls only for about 12 to 16 days due to the stagnant front. However, the rainy season varies greatly from year to year. The rainy season is a representative summer weather in East Asian countries, including the Republic of Korea, and accounts for more than 30% of the precipitation on the Korean Peninsula. For this reason, some call the rainy season the \"fifth season.\"[8][9] \nIt is usually a form of torrential rain that pours suddenly and then stops. In particular, the recent rainy season is referred to as a \"nocturnal rainy season,\" and it is often in the form of a lull during the day, and local heavy rain pouring down at night. In the case of cloudy days, the upper layer may be heated rather than the ground during the day, and at night, the clouds trap the heat of the lower layer while the upper layer cools, so convection develops. In fact, considering that showers come during the day, nights account for a high percentage of 55%.[10] \nA distinct congestion front is created between the cold and humid Okhotsk Sea air mass located on the northern Russian coast and the hot and humid North Pacific air mass near the Ogasawara Islands, resulting in a rainy season. However, in the case of the Korean Peninsula, not only the Okhotsk Sea air mass but also the cold and dry Siberian air mass contributes to the rainy season. Another cause of the rainy season is said to be the Bering Sea and the Tibetan Plateau. To be exact, the speed of high pressure formation varies depending on the amount of ice in the Bering Sea and the amount of snow accumulated in the Tibetan Plateau, as the rainy season begins with the speed at which each high pressure in the north and south of the Korean Peninsula moves. For this reason, rainy seasons are regarded as a kind of East Asian seasonal wind climate abroad.[11] \nThe rainy season ends when the North Pacific high pressure expands and the Okhotsk Sea fleet retreats. Since then, as the North Pacific high pressure began to dominate the Korean Peninsula, the heat wave began in earnest and entered the middle of summer. However, during the period from summer to autumn, as the North Pacific high pressure contracts and cold air expands in the north, the stagnant front moves south again and settles near the Korean Peninsula, which is called the \"Autumn rainy season\" or \"second rainy season.\" The autumn rainy season generally occurs between late August and early September, and although it is usually shorter than the early summer rainy season, it sometimes pours more rain than the summer rainy season.[12]\n\n\nDue to severe climate change caused by global warming in India, daytime temperatures have risen to 32 degrees Celsius since mid-April and 39 degrees in late April, resulting in a strong heat wave in mid-summer, which also hit Korea in early June this year.[13]\n\n\nOn August 30, 2022, the head of the Korea Meteorological Administration pointed out that it was impossible to predict the recent heavy rain, and that the traditional expression of \"rainy season\" now seems to have expired.[14]\n\n\n\n### Yellow dust[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Dust\n\nAsian Dust, known in Korea as the Yellow Dust, refers to a phenomenon in which when low pressure passes through the desert area of China, a large amount of yellow dust floats in the air or lands on the move due to strong winds and topography, affecting Korea. Yellow Dust occurs in desert areas in China and Mongolia, and the addition of several conditions to the sand particles generated here affects South Korea. Deserts where Yellow dust usually occurs include Taklamakan, Ordos, and Gobi. In South Korea, Yellow Dust usually occurs in spring, especially in April.[15] Yellow dust has been recorded since ancient times, and the damage was not so severe because it was only a sandstorm in ancient times, but in modern times, the damage is getting worse due to China's rapid industrialization and desertification.\n\n\nIn summer or autumn, the roots of rain and plants play a role in holding onto the sand. However, in spring, the dry soil, which had been frozen throughout the winter, melts and breaks down into small pieces, resulting in small sand dust of less than 20 \u03bcm in size. When low pressure passes over the generated sand dust, it rises to a high sky of 3,000-5,000m by a strong ascending air current and then travels in westerlies and jets of about 30m per second. Since then, it has descended from Korea and Japan, where wind speed has slowed, and sometimes even moved to the United States (April 1998). It takes about two to three days to get to the Korean Peninsula from the origin.\nIn South Korea, Yellow Dust is observed for 3 to 6 days mainly from March to May every year. In terms of the total number of observations nationwide, Jeolla-do (Gwangju, the region with the largest number of occurrences) has been observed. In terms of the number of days of occurrence, Seoul, Gyeonggi and the west coast are long. In rare cases, it was observed in Seoul in the winter of 1991 (November 30, 1991 to December 3). Early yellow dust occurred on January 25, 1999, and severe yellow dust occurred around 1 p.m. on January 2, 2001.[16]\n\n\nHowever, there is also a strange tendency, such as yellow dust in December 2022 in winter.[17]\n\n\n\n### Typhoons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Typhoons in the Korean Peninsula\n\nSouth Korea is less vulnerable to typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, the east coast of China, or the Philippines. From one to three typhoons can be expected per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country's generally mountainous terrain.\nTyphoons often occur from midsummer to early autumn, July, August, and September. Most of the typhoons invading the Korean Peninsula are concentrated during this period, and sometimes indirect effects occur in June and October. Even October has a direct impact and lands.In the summer, the water on the surface of the ocean, which received hot heat, evaporates and rises by convection and condenses, and the latent heat released heats up the surrounding water vapor again to the troposphere interface.\nIn the case of typhoons heading to Korea, most of them fall into Japan, or Jeju Island, Gyeongsangnam-do, and Jeollanam-do are often directly damaged. However, In September 1984, record floods caused the deaths of 190 people and left 200,000 homeless. This disaster prompted the North Korean government to make an unprecedented offer of humanitarian aid in the form of rice, medicine, clothes, and building materials. South Korea accepted these items and distributed them to flood victims.[18]\nAs global warming progresses, the power of typhoons is likely to become stronger. In fact, hurricanes that occur in the Atlantic Ocean, where the average water temperature is 1 to 2 degrees higher than in the Pacific Ocean, are causing much more intensive damage than typhoons in the Pacific Ocean. Since 2013, the typhoon season has been delayed due to climate change, reducing summer typhoons and increasing autumn typhoons. The season came in October 2013, 2020, and November 2019. As a result, the number of super typhoons is increasing.[19]\n\n\n\n## Resources and land use[edit]\n\n\nNatural resources\nSouth Korea produces coal, tungsten, graphite, molybdenum, lead, and has potential for hydropower.\n### Land use[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in South Korea\n\nArable land: 15.3%\nPermanent crops: 2.2%\nPermanent pasture: 0.6%\nForest: 63.9%\nOther: 18.0% (figures as at 2011)\nApproximately 17% (as at 2022) of the land surface of South Korea is used for crop production (including temporary crops), most of the remainder being mountains and hill land. South Korea is self-sufficient in rice and potatoes but depends on imports to support its dominantly urban population.[20]\n\n\n\nIrrigated land\n[21]\n8,804\u00a0km\u00b2\nTotal renewable water resources\n\n69.7\u00a0km3\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)[21]\nTotal: 25.47\u00a0km3/yr (26%/12%/62%)\nPer capita: 548.7 m3/yr\n## Environmental concerns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environment of South Korea\n\n### Natural hazards[edit]\n\n\nThere are occasional big typhoons that bring high winds and floods. There is also low-level seismic activity, which is common in the southwest.\n\n\n\n#### Volcanism[edit]\n\n\nHallasan (elev. 1,950\u00a0m (6,398\u00a0ft)) is considered historically active although it has not erupted in many centuries. Earthquake activity is minimal; however, since 2016, there have been two earthquakes over 5.4 magnitude. Records of historical periods of Korean history (27AD to 1904), alongside data from surviving buildings, have been used to refine estimates for the severity of historical earthquakes both in and under the sea round the Korean peninsula.[22]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n#### Current issues[edit]\n\n\nHabitat loss and degradation, especially of wetlands, through coastal reclamation (e.g. Saemangeum, Shiwa, Song Do, Namyang Bay, Asan Bay, in the south-west, Gwangyang Bay and the Nakdong Estuary) have caused huge declines in fisheries and of biodiversity. Most riverine wetland in Korea is now threatened by the proposed Grand Korean Waterway project. There are also some problems air pollution in large cities; as well as water pollution from the discharge of sewage and industrial effluents. Drift netting is another issue.\n\n\n\n#### International agreements[edit]\n\n\nSouth Korea is a party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Extreme points of South Korea\n* List of national parks of South Korea\n* Lists of islands \u00a7\u00a0Asia\n* List of lakes of Korea\n* List of rivers of Korea\n* List of mountains in Korea\n* Geography of North Korea\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* ![Public Domain](image)\u00a0This article incorporates public domain material from *The World Factbook*.

The city is centred on the Huangpu River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, and extends outwards in all directions, with the suburbs and satellite towns reaching east to the East China Sea, north and west to Jiangsu province, and south to Zhejiang province over Hangzhou Bay.\n\n\nThe vast majority of Shanghai's land area is flat, apart from a few hills in the southwest corner, due to its location on the alluvial plain of the Yangtze's river delta. The city has many rivers and lakes and is known for its rich water resources, and thanks to its coastal, riverside location and warm climate ensuring ice-free waters, provides easy access to China's interior, resulting in Shanghai being the world's largest port.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\nShanghai is located in the middle of China's east coast, near the mouth of the Yangtze River, being one of the core cities in the Yangtze River Delta region and one of the coastal cities in China. It is bordered by the Yangtze River to the north, the East China Sea to the east, Hangzhou Bay to the south, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces to the west. The city is roughly equidistant to Beijing and Hong Kong, and is located at 31\u00b012\u2032N 121\u00b030\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff31.200\u00b0N 121.500\u00b0E\ufeff / 31.200; 121.500, roughly the same latitude as San Diego, New Orleans, Bermuda, Marrakech, Cairo, Jerusalem, and Lahore. Cities within mainland China that lie on approximately the same longitude include Fuxin, Jinzhou, Dalian, Yantai, Ningbo, and Taizhou (Zhejiang). The municipality lies about due north of Taipei and Manila.\n\n\n\n* Latitude: 30\u00b0 42' to 31\u00b0 52' N\n* Longitude: 120\u00b0 52' to 121\u00b0 58' E\n\n\n### Area[edit]\n\n\n* **Municipality**:[2]\n\t+ *Total:* 6,340.5\u00a0km2 (2,448.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n\t+ *Land:* 6,218.65\u00a0km2 (2,401.03\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n\t+ *Water:* 121.85\u00a0km2 (47.05\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\n\n\n### Waterways[edit]\n\n\nShanghai contains 53.1\u00a0km (33.0\u00a0mi) of rivers and streams and is part of the Lake Tai drainage area. Suzhou Creek is 125\u00a0km (78\u00a0mi) long and has an average width of 70 to 80 meters, while the Huangpu River is 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) long and is around 400 meters wide.[2]\n\n\nShanghai's development of the deep-water port of Yangshan in Zhejiang was made necessary by the increasing size of container ships but also the silting of the Yangtze, which narrows to less than 20 meters (66\u00a0ft) as far out as 45 miles (70\u00a0km) from Hengsha.[3]\n\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islands of Shanghai\n\nThe Municipality of Shanghai administers a number of islands around its peninsula, including most of Chongming Island (1,267\u00a0km2 or 489\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), the second-largest island of mainland China. Chongming, Changxing (88.54\u00a0km2 or 34.19\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and Hengsha (55.74\u00a0km2 or 21.52\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) comprise the permanently inhabited islands of Shanghai, while the city's 19 uninhabited islands covered 226.27\u00a0km2 (87.36\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2006, with a total coastline of 309 kilometers (192\u00a0mi).[4]\n\n\nMost of Shanghai's islands are small alluvial islands (\u6c99) created by the natural deposition of vast amounts of silt by the Yangtze River. The major islands (\u5c9b) of Chongming, Changxing, and Hengsha in Chongming County were formed in this way, as were the shoals of Jiuduansha (114.6\u00a0km2 or 44.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) off of Pudong. The natural expansion of these islands has been greatly accelerated by reclamation projects, with Chongming more than doubling in size between 1950 and 2010.[5] Unlike the islands of Chongming County, Jiuduansha was expanded and protected as an uninhabited nature reserve[6] to make up for the wetlands destroyed by the creation of Pudong International Airport.[7] It is an important spawning ground for Shanghai's hairy crab community,[8] as well as other maritime[8][9][10] and avian species.[11] A few islands in Hangzhou Bay off Jinshan District are rocky islands (also \u5c9b). Dajinshan, Xiaojinshan, and Fushan are municipal nature reserves.[4] The peak of Dajinshan is the highest point in the Municipality of Shanghai, with altitude of 103.4 meters (339\u00a0ft).\n\n\nShanghai does not administer the islands of Greater and Lesser Yangshan, the site of the Port of Shanghai's Yangshan Deep-Water Port. Instead, the belong to Zhejiang Province, despite being linked via the Donghai Bridge to Pudong. Similarly, Chongming's absorption of Jiangsu's Yonglongsha shoal produced a long but narrow exclave of that province on its northern shore.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 74\n\n\n\n8\n\n2\n | 59\n\n\n\n10\n\n4\n | 94\n\n\n\n14\n\n7\n | 74\n\n\n\n20\n\n12\n | 85\n\n\n\n25\n\n17\n | 182\n\n\n\n28\n\n22\n | 146\n\n\n\n32\n\n26\n | 214\n\n\n\n32\n\n26\n | 87\n\n\n\n28\n\n22\n | 56\n\n\n\n23\n\n17\n | 52\n\n\n\n17\n\n11\n | 44\n\n\n\n11\n\n5\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: CMA |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 2.9\n\n\n\n47\n\n36\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n50\n\n39\n | 3.7\n\n\n\n57\n\n44\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n67\n\n53\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n77\n\n63\n | 7.2\n\n\n\n82\n\n71\n | 5.7\n\n\n\n90\n\n78\n | 8.4\n\n\n\n89\n\n78\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n82\n\n72\n | 2.2\n\n\n\n73\n\n62\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n63\n\n51\n | 1.7\n\n\n\n52\n\n40\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\n![](image)A rare snowfall in Shanghai\n![](image)The Bund and the skyline behind it during a rainy evening\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Cfa*) and experiences four distinct seasons. In winter, cold northerly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing, and although not usually associated with snow, the city can receive one or two days of snowfall per year. In contrast, and in spite of being the peak tourist season, summer in Shanghai is very warm and humid, with occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms. The city is also susceptible to typhoons, none of which in recent years has caused considerable damage.[12] The most pleasant seasons are Spring, although changeable, and Autumn, which is generally sunny and dry.\n\n\n**Climate statistics of 2013:**[13]\n\n\n\n* Average annual temperature: 17.6\u00a0\u00b0C (63.7\u00a0\u00b0F)\n* Highest recorded air temperature: 39.9\u00a0\u00b0C (103.8\u00a0\u00b0F)\n* Lowest recorded air temperature: \u22124.2\u00a0\u00b0C (24.4\u00a0\u00b0F)\n* Annual hours of sunshine: 1,885.9\n* Evaporation: 1,120.5\u00a0mm (44.1\u00a0in)\n* Precipitation: 1,173.4\u00a0mm (46.2\u00a0in)\n* Annual rainy days: 111\n* Frost-free period: 259 days\n\n\n| Climate data for Shanghai (Minhang District), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1951\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 4.9(40.8)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221210.1(13.8)\n | \u22127.9(17.8)\n | \u22125.4(22.3)\n | \u22120.5(31.1)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | \u22124.2(24.4)\n | \u22128.5(16.7)\n | \u221210.1(13.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 70.4(2.77)\n | 65.4(2.57)\n | 95.4(3.76)\n | 82.5(3.25)\n | 93.2(3.67)\n | 207.3(8.16)\n | 148.0(5.83)\n | 187.1(7.37)\n | 118.1(4.65)\n | 68.4(2.69)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 50.3(1.98)\n | 1,245.5(49.04)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.1 mm) | 10.9\n | 10.2\n | 12.9\n | 11.3\n | 11.2\n | 14.5\n | 11.7\n | 12.4\n | 9.8\n | 7.4\n | 9.1\n | 8.3\n | 129.7\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 1.8\n | 1.4\n | 0.4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.1\n | 0.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74\n | 73\n | 72\n | 71\n | 73\n | 80\n | 78\n | 78\n | 76\n | 73\n | 74\n | 72\n | 75\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 114.8\n | 117.9\n | 143.8\n | 168.1\n | 176.8\n | 131.2\n | 209.4\n | 202.3\n | 163.7\n | 162.1\n | 131.1\n | 129.7\n | 1,850.9\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 36\n | 37\n | 39\n | 43\n | 41\n | 31\n | 49\n | 50\n | 45\n | 46\n | 42\n | 41\n | 42\n |\n| Source: China Meteorological Administration[14][15] |\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 16 districts and 1 county that make up the Municipality of Shanghai\nPuxi:\n\nYangpu\n\nHongkou\n\nZhabei\n\nPutuo\n\nChangning\n\nXuhui\n\nJing'an\n\nHuangpu\n\nChongming\n\nBaoshan\n\nJiading\n\nPudong\n\nQingpu\n\nMinhang\n\nSongjiang\n\nFengxian\n\nJinshan\n\nShanghai city proper is bisected by the Huangpu River: Puxi, on the west side, is the historic center of the city, and includes the districts of Yangpu, Hongkou, Putuo, Changning, Xuhui, Jing'an, and Huangpu.

A 10-year, US$1 billion cleanup of Suzhou Creek, which runs through the city center, is expected to be finished in 2008,[16] and the government also provides incentives for transportation companies to invest in LPG buses and taxis. Air pollution in Shanghai is low compared to other Chinese cities such as Beijing, but the rapid development over the past decades means it is still high on worldwide standards, comparable to Los Angeles.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Maps and satellite images[edit]\n\n\n* ![German map of Shanghai in 1888](image)\n\nGerman map of Shanghai in 1888\n* ![US Army 1933 map](image)\n\nUS Army 1933 map\n* ![False-color satellite image](image)\n\nFalse-color satellite image\n* ![SHANG-HAI, EAST (1952)](image)\n\nSHANG-HAI, EAST (1952)\n* ![SHANG-HAI (SHANGHAI) AND VICINITY](image)\n\nSHANG-HAI (SHANGHAI) AND VICINITY\n* ![Population density and elevation above sea level](image)\n\nPopulation density and elevation above sea level\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Geography of China\n* Yangtze River Delta\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Shanghai now the world's largest cargo port\u00a0!\".
