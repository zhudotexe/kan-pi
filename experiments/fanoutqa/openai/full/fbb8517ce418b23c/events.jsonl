Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (*tanuki*) and cats[5] from the 1988 film *My Neighbor Totoro*. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are *Spirited Away* (2001), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), and *Ponyo* (2008).[6] Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.[7]\n\n\nFive of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime feature films made in Japan. *Spirited Away* is second, grossing 31.68 billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide; and *Princess Mononoke* is fourth, grossing 20.18 billion yen. Three of their films have won the Animage Grand Prix award, four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, and five have received Academy Award nominations. *Spirited Away* won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[8]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, *The Boy and the Heron* (2023).[9][10] In September 2023, Nippon TV announced that Studio Ghibli would become a unit of Nippon Television Holdings in October.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"Ghibli\" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun *ghibli* (also used in English), an Italianization of the Libyan Arabic name for a hot desert wind (قبلي *ghiblī*) and nickname of the Italian Caproni Ca.309 aircraft. The name was chosen by Miyazaki due to his passion for aviation and also for the idea that the studio would \"blow a new wind through the anime industry\".[12][13] Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as \"Giburi\" (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the studio's name is written in Japanese as *Jiburi* (ジブリ, [d͡ʑiꜜbɯ̟ᵝɾʲi] ⓘ).[12]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Tokuma Shoten era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nHayao Miyazaki\n![](image)\nToshio Suzuki\n![](image)\nIsao Takahata\nMiyazaki, Suzuki, and Takahata founded Studio Ghibli in 1985, alongside Yasuyoshi Tokuma.\n\nFounded on June 15, 1985, Studio Ghibli was headed by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on *The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun* in 1968 and the *Panda! Go, Panda!* films in 1972 and 1973. Suzuki had been an editor at Tokuma Shoten's *Animage* manga magazine.[14]\n\n\nThe studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*. Suzuki was part of the film's production team, and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata to join them.[15][16][17]\n\n\nThe studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata (most notably with *Grave of the Fireflies*). Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondō, Hiroyuki Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films. In their book *Anime Classics Zettai!*, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as \"a mainstay of Studio Ghibli's extraordinary design and production team\".[18] At one time the studio was based in Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo.[19]\n\n\nIn August 1996, The Walt Disney Company and Tokuma Shoten formed a partnership wherein Walt Disney Studios would be the sole international distributor for Tokuma Shoten's Studio Ghibli animated films.[20] Under this agreement, Disney also agreed to finance 10% of the studio's production costs.[21] Since then, all three of the aforementioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli that were previously dubbed by Streamline Pictures have been re-dubbed by Disney.[22] On June 1, 1997, Tokuma Shoten Publishing consolidated its media operations by merging Studio Ghibli, Tokuma Shoten Intermedia software and Tokuma International under one location.[23]\n\n\nOver the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine *Animage*, which regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a section titled \"Ghibli Notes\". Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. Saeko Himuro's novel *Umi ga Kikoeru* was serialised in the magazine and subsequently adapted into *Ocean Waves*, Studio Ghibli's first animated feature-length film created for television. It was directed by Tomomi Mochizuki.[24]\n\n\nIn October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo.[25] It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.\n\n\nThe studio is also known for its strict \"no-edits\" policy in licensing their films abroad due to *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as *Warriors of the Wind*.\n\n\n\n### Independent era[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1999 and 2005, Studio Ghibli was a subsidiary brand of Tokuma Shoten; however, that partnership ended in April 2005, when Studio Ghibli was spun off from Tokuma Shoten and was re-established as an independent company with relocated headquarters.\n\n\nOn February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from the position of Studio Ghibli president, which he had held since 2005, and Koji Hoshino (former president of Walt Disney Japan) took over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve films with his own hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his employees. Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli to sell its videos since 1996 and has also aided the release of the *Princess Mononoke* film in the United States.[26] Suzuki still serves on the company's board of directors.\n\n\nTakahata developed a project for release after Gorō Miyazaki's (director of *Tales from Earthsea* and Hayao's son) *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* – an adaptation of *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter*. The last film Hayao Miyazaki directed before retiring from feature films was *The Wind Rises* which is about the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and its creator.[27]\n\n\nOn Sunday, September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice to confirm his retirement, saying: \"I know I've said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, 'Once again.' But this time I am quite serious.\"[28]\n\n\nIn 2013, a documentary directed by Mami Sunada called *The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness* (Japanese: 夢と狂気の王国, Hepburn: *Yume to kyōki no ōkoku*) was created delving into the lives of those working at Studio Ghibli and the productions of the animated films *The Wind Rises* and *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya*, including storyboard sketching, inking, painting, and voice actor selection for the films.[29]\n\n\nOn January 31, 2014, it was announced that Gorō Miyazaki will direct his first anime television series, *Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya*, an adaptation of Astrid Lindgren's *Ronia the Robber's Daughter* for NHK. The series is computer-animated, produced by Polygon Pictures, and co-produced by Studio Ghibli.[30][31]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Toshio Suzuki retired as producer and assumed the new position of general manager. Yoshiaki Nishimura replaced Suzuki in the producer role.[32]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take a \"brief pause\" to re-evaluate and restructure in the wake of Miyazaki's retirement. He stated some concerns about where the company would go in the future.[33][34][35][36] This led to speculation that Studio Ghibli will never produce another feature film again. On November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, \"That was not my intention, though. All I did was announce that I would be retiring and not making any more features.\"[37] Lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura among several other staffers from Ghibli, such as director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, left to found Studio Ponoc in April 2015, working on the film *Mary and the Witch's Flower*.\n\n\nThe 2016 animated fantasy film *The Red Turtle*, directed and co-written by Dutch-British animator Michaël Dudok de Wit in his feature film debut, was a co-production between Studio Ghibli and Wild Bunch.[38]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Toshio Suzuki announced that Hayao Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film with Studio Ghibli.[39]\n\n\nOn November 28, 2017, Koji Hoshino stepped down as president; he was replaced by Kiyofumi Nakajima (former Ghibli Museum director). Hoshino was then appointed as Chairman of Studio Ghibli.[40][41]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Toshio Suzuki confirmed that a new film from Gorō Miyazaki is in development at Studio Ghibli. On June 3, 2020, Studio Ghibli announced that the film would be an adaptation of the novel *Earwig and the Witch* by Diana Wynne Jones. The film was announced as the first full 3D CG animated Ghibli film and slated for a television premiere on NHK in late 2020.[42] The company had a net income of ¥1.253 billion, and a total asset worth ¥24.521 billion by August 2021.[43]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Studio Ghibli themed amusement park Ghibli Park opened.[44]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2023, Koji Hoshino announced that he had stepped down as chairman, and would serve as a representative director before planning to exit Studio Ghibli completely during the company's annual general shareholder's meeting in June, one month prior to the release of director Hayao Miyazaki's final movie *The Boy and the Heron* on July 14. He also announced that Toshio Suzuki would be replacing Kiyofumi Nakajima as president of Studio Ghibli, assuming the role for the first time since 2008, while Nakajima would continue to serve as a director.[45] This change of management came about amidst reports that Suzuki had allegedly been mismanaging company funds by directing them towards his girlfriend's failed business ventures. This reportedly created tension between Suzuki and Hoshino, with the latter reportedly citing it as a long-term internal problem at the company since the couple met in 2013 and was the reason for his planned departure from the company, although a spokesperson for Studio Ghibli in a statement to *Variety* denied that Hoshino's departure had anything to do with these reports.[46][47][48] The source of the allegations came from the tabloid paper, *Shūkan Josei* and was not corroborated by the mainstream media in Japan.[49]\n\n\n\n### Nippon TV era[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2023, the studio became a subsidiary of Nippon Television Holdings, Inc.. Studio Ghibli's leadership transitioned to Hiroyuki Fukuda, a senior executive at Nippon TV. Toshio Suzuki became Chairman and Hayao Miyazaki became Honorary Chairman. Nippon TV acquired a 42.3% stake in Studio Ghibli. The decision was driven by the advanced ages of Miyazaki and Suzuki, aged 82 and 75, respectively. The studio had considered Miyazaki's son, Goro Miyazaki, as a successor but opted for external leadership due to concerns and Goro's reluctance. Nippon TV started to handle management, allowing Studio Ghibli to focus on creative endeavors.[11][50] The takeover took effect on October 6.[51]\n\n\n\n## Distribution rights[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical and home media rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the company's films (along with *The Castle of Cagliostro* and all other *Lupin the Third* titles for movie theaters as well as *Mary and the Witch's Flower*) are distributed by Toho theatrically, except for *Castle in the Sky*, *Kiki's Delivery Service* (which were distributed by Toei Company along with *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, with Toei producing *The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun*), and *My Neighbors the Yamadas*, which was distributed by Shochiku.\n\n\nFor home media, a majority of Studio Ghibli releases are distributed by Walt Disney Studios Japan. This also includes *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *The Castle of Cagliostro* and *Mary and the Witch's Flower*.[52] Pony Canyon occasionally releases Ghibli documentaries on home media, and also distributes rental versions of Ghibli's movies under a deal with Disney. Pony Canyon also fully distributed the standalone version of *Earwig and the Witch* on home media.\n\n\nBefore the Disney deal, Tokuma Shoten released Ghibli movies themselves through their \"Animage Video\" imprint, as well as all Laserdisc releases of the movies, as the Disney deal did not include that format.\n\n\n\n#### International[edit]\n\n\nAfter purchasing the global distribution rights from World Film Corporation,[53] Manson International and Showmen, Inc. produced a 95-minute English dub of *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, titled *Warriors of the Wind*,[54] which was released theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures on June 14, 1985, followed by a VHS release in December 1985.[55][56] The voice actors and actresses were not credited, and the film was heavily edited to give it a faster pace.[57] The film received a PG rating just like Disney's later English dub.[58] By removing several of the longer dialogue scenes, some of the environmentalist themes were simplified as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, altered to remove Nausicaä's childhood connection to them.[59] Most of the characters' names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The North American poster and VHS cover featured a cadre of male characters who are not in the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. Overall, approximately 22 minutes was cut for North American release.[58] *Warriors of the Wind* also prompted Miyazaki to allow translator Toren Smith of Studio Proteus to create an official, faithful translation of the *Nausicaä* manga for Viz Media.[60]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, an English dub of *Castle in the Sky* was produced for international Japan Airlines flights at the request of Tokuma Shoten. The *Castle* dub was briefly screened in the United States by Streamline Pictures. Carl Macek, the head of Streamline, was disappointed with this dub, deeming it \"adequate, but clumsy\".[61] Following this, Tokuma allowed Streamline to dub their future acquisitions *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*. In April 1993, Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the *Totoro* dub as a theatrical release, and the dub was later released onto VHS and eventually onto DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. In the early 1990s, an English dub of *Porco Rosso* was produced by an unknown company, again for international Japan Airlines flights. The original dubs can be seen on the 1996 Ghibli ga Ippai Laserdisc set, and on the initial copies for the Japanese DVD releases of *Totoro*, *Laputa* and *Porco*.\n\n\nIn 1996, Walt Disney Studios acquired worldwide distribution rights to the Studio Ghibli library, with Disney redubbing all previously dubbed films.[20][62] In addition, Walt Disney Studios Japan agreed to contribute 10% of the funding for all future releases, starting with *My Neighbors the Yamadas*, in exchange for right of first refusal regarding international distribution.[21] Disney continues with this practice to this day, even extending it to the works of Studio Ponoc and to co-productions like *The Red Turtle* in Japan. It was said to have taken four years for Disney and Studio Ghibli to reach a distribution deal. Originally, the Ghibli films were meant to headline a line of videos called *Animation Celebration*, highlighting critically acclaimed animated films from around the world. These plans never materialized in full, but the *Animation Celebration* logo can be seen on Disney's original VHS release of *Kiki's Delivery Service*. During Disney's tenure, the studio produced the English dubs and released 15 of Ghibli's films, plus *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, through the Walt Disney Pictures, Buena Vista Home Video, Miramax and Touchstone Pictures banners.[63]\n\n\nDisney and Ghibli have also selectively chosen not to promote and record an English-dubbed version for films and works deemed less internationally marketable, including some of Takahata's more developmental and obscure pieces.[64] Although the Studio has a \"No cuts\" policy in terms of international versions and dubs, this does not apply to promotional posters, etc., for which the film makers collaborate with Disney to produce cultural appropriate international versions. The Studio has not shied away from slight rebranding on the international stage in order to convey slightly tweaked promotional imagery for different cultural norms. One example of these slight tweaks to international promotional materials can be seen between the Japanese and English versions of the movie poster for *Spirited Away* (2001). For American and other English-speaking audiences, the name of the film was changed from the Japanese version, which directly translates roughly to, \"The Disappearance of Chihiro and Sen\", to *Spirited Away* to suggest more mystical, otherworldly themes, since the direct Japanese translation could be taken to mean that Chihiro/Sen disappeared due to some more dangerous reason. On the American movie poster, more pictures of spirits from the film were added to the background to further pique the viewer's interest with more supernatural themes, creating an association between the pictures spirits and what most American people would think of as \"ghosts\". For the Japanese poster, there are fewer spirits as the Japanese Shinto religion normalizes the existence of spirits, so less emphasis is needed to convey the importance of non-human spirits. Also, Disney enlarged the \"Studio Ghibli\" and \"Hayao Miyazaki\" labels on the poster, helping to bring greater awareness to the studio through the success of *Spirited Away*.[65]\n\n\nIn 2011, GKIDS acquired the North American theatrical distribution rights of the aforementioned Ghibli films, with Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment retaining the home video rights.[66] Afterwards, in 2013, GKIDS acquired the US and Canadian distribution rights to *From Up on Poppy Hill*. The film, which Disney passed on to GKIDS due to dealing with potential incest, marked the first time since 1996 that Disney handed a Studio Ghibli film off to another distributor. Afterwards, GKIDS would go on to distribute the films Disney found to be too mature or unmarketable for American audiences: *Only Yesterday*, *Ocean Waves*, *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* and *When Marnie Was There*. Finally, in July 2017, Disney relinquished its home video rights (with the exception of *The Wind Rises*, which remained with Disney until 2020 due to a distribution clause) to GKIDS, which handles all theatrical and home media distribution of Ghibli films in North America along with *Mary and the Witch's Flower*.[62] Nevertheless, Disney still continues to handle select distribution in Japan (home media), Taiwan and China.\n\n\nGKIDS' home media releases have been handled by multiple distributors. Cinedigm distributed the home media release of *Poppy Hill*, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment distributed the home media releases of *Kaguya*, *Marnie*, *Mary*, *Yesterday* and *Waves*, and Shout! Factory all subsequent releases thus far. The Ghibli films owned by GKIDS were made available for digital purchases on most major services in the United States and Canada on December 17, 2019, through Shout! Factory.[67]\n\n\nOutside Asia (including Japan) and North America since 2003, Goodfellas (a former subsidiary of Wild Bunch, formerly known as Wild Bunch International) has been Studio Ghibli's international sales holder.\n\n\nIndividual rights to Ghibli's films are held by various third parties, including Wild Bunch (France and Belgium)[a],[68] Elysian Film Group (United Kingdom and Ireland),[b] Leonine (Germany), Lucky Red (Italy), Vértigo Films (Spain)[c], Crunchyroll Store Australia (Australia and New Zealand)[d] and Encore Films[e] in Singapore and Southeast Asia.\n\n\nNotably, *The Secret World of Arrietty* received a second dub exclusive to the United Kingdom, produced by StudioCanal UK, likely due to the film's origins being from Mary Norton's British novel *The Borrowers*.\n\n\nDisney formerly held international sales rights until they were sold off to Goodfellas (then Wild Bunch) in 2003. Disney kept the French distribution rights to Ghibli's library until September 2020, when it had expired and transitioned off to Wild Bunch.[70] Since 2021, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment serves as the home media distributor of Studio Ghibli's catalog via its distribution deal with Wild Bunch through the Wild Side Vidéo label.[71][72][73]\n\n\n\n### Streaming rights[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2019, Studio Ghibli opted not to make its films available digitally, feeling that physical media and theatrical events like GKIDS' Studio Ghibli Fest would work more towards their goal of mindful care and curation for their films. Disney had previously lobbied for a streaming deal with Ghibli during their distribution tenure, but such attempts were never materialized.[63] The studio heads changed their minds after hearing a quote from American actor and director Woody Allen about how there should be multiple outlets for feature films.[74]\n\n\nOn October 17, 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max (now Max) announced it had acquired exclusive streaming rights to Studio Ghibli's catalogue in the United States as part of a deal with GKIDS; these films were available when the service launched in May 2020.[75] On January 20, 2020, it was announced that Netflix acquired the exclusive streaming rights to this catalogue in all regions where it operates except for the United States (in which Netflix does have streaming rights to *The Castle of Cagliostro* and *Mary and the Witch's Flower*), as part of a deal with Ghibli's international sales rights partner Wild Bunch. Seven of twenty-one films in the studio's catalogue were released on February 1, 2020, with the others following on March 1 and April 1.[76] Netflix then struck a separate deal with GKIDS for streaming rights in Canada which was announced on June 22, and came into effect on June 25 for most films.[77] Currently,[*when?*] no streaming rights deals have been announced for Studio Ghibli's home country of Japan, nor for markets such as China where neither Netflix nor HBO Max is available.\n\n\n\n### *Grave of the Fireflies*[edit]\n\n\nMost of the above deals exclude *Grave of the Fireflies*; unlike most of the other films, which were published by Tokuma Shoten, *Grave of the Fireflies* was produced and is owned by Shinchosha, which also had published the short story it was based on, and as such, fell into different rights holdings.[67]\n\n\n*Grave of the Fireflies* was released in Japan on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the *Ghibli ga Ippai* Collection on August 7, 1998. On July 29, 2005, a DVD release was distributed through Warner Home Video. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the complete collector's edition DVD on August 6, 2008. WDSJ released the film on Blu-ray twice on July 18, 2012: one as a single release, and one in a two-film set with *My Neighbor Totoro*.\n\n\nIt was released on VHS in North America by Central Park Media in a subtitled form on June 2, 1993.[78] They later released the film with an English dub on VHS on September 1, 1998 (the same day Disney released *Kiki's Delivery Service* in North America) and an all-Regions DVD (which also included the original Japanese with English subtitles) on October 7 the same year. It was later released on a two-disc DVD set (which once again included both the English dub and the original Japanese with English subtitles as well as the film's storyboards with the second disc containing more extensive Bonus Features) on October 8, 2002. It was released by Central Park Media one last time on December 7, 2004. Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media,[79] ADV Films acquired the rights and re-released it on DVD on July 7, 2009.[80] Following the September 1, 2009 shutdown and re-branding of ADV,[81] their successor, Sentai Filmworks, rescued the film and released a remastered DVD on March 6, 2012.[82][83] A Blu-ray edition was released on November 20, 2012, featuring an all-new English dub produced by Seraphim Digital, along with a digital release that same year.[84]\n\n\nStudioCanal released a Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on July 1, 2013.[85] Madman Entertainment released the film in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Studio Ghibli works\n\nWhile not technically Studio Ghibli films, *The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun* (1968), *Panda! Go Panda!* (1972), *The Castle of Cagliostro* (1979), *Jarinko Chie* (1981), *Gauche the Cellist* (1982), *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* (1984), *The Red Turtle* (2016), *Mary and the Witch's Flower* (2017) and *Modest Heroes* (2018) are sometimes grouped together with the Studio Ghibli library (particularly with the *Ghibli ga Ippai* home video collection released by Walt Disney Studios Japan) due to their ties to the studio.\n\n\n*Horus* and *Cagliostro* were the feature-length directorial debuts of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki respectively, and were produced by Toei Animation and TMS Entertainment years before the founding of Studio Ghibli.\n\n\n*Nausicaä* was directed by Miyazaki at Topcraft, a studio which Miyazaki, Takahata and Toshio Suzuki later purchased and renamed Studio Ghibli. As a result, the film has often been rereleased and marketed as a Studio Ghibli movie.\n\n\n*The Red Turtle* was a collaborative effort by Studio Ghibli with Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit and was branded as a Studio Ghibli release internationally. It was distributed by Sony Pictures Classics in North and Latin America.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the list below, films that appear in Studio Ghibli's official filmography[86] are listed. Other Studio Ghibli productions are listed here.\n\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Original release\n | RT | MC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984\n | *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* | Hayao Miyazaki | Isao Takahata | Joe Hisaishi | March 11, 1984\n | 90%[87] | 86[88] |\n| 1986\n | *Castle in the Sky* | August 2, 1986\n | 96%[89] | 78[90] |\n| 1988\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | Tōru Hara\n | April 16, 1988\n | 93%[91] | 86[92] |\n| *Grave of the Fireflies* | Isao Takahata | Michio Mamiya | 100%[93] | 94[94] |\n| 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 29, 1989\n | 98%[95] | 83[96] |\n| 1991\n | *Only Yesterday* | Isao Takahata | Toshio Suzuki | Katz Hoshi\n | July 20, 1991\n | 100%[97] | 90[98] |\n| 1992\n | *Porco Rosso* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 18, 1992\n | 96%[99] | 83[100] |\n| 1993\n | *Ocean Waves* | Tomomi Mochizuki | Seiji OkudaNozomu Takahashi\n | Shigeru Nagata\n | May 5, 1993[A] | 89%[101] | 73[102] |\n| 1994\n | *Pom Poko* | Isao Takahata | Shang Shang Typhoon | July 16, 1994\n | 86%[103] | 77[104] |\n| 1995\n | *Whisper of the Heart* | Yoshifumi Kondō | Hayao Miyazaki | Yuji Nomi | July 15, 1995\n | 94%[105] | 75[106] |\n| 1997\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 12, 1997\n | 93%[107] | 76[108] |\n| 1999\n | *My Neighbors the Yamadas* | Isao Takahata | Akiko Yano | July 17, 1999\n | 78%[109] | 75[110] |\n| 2001\n | *Spirited Away* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2001\n | 96%[111] | 96[112] |\n| 2002\n | *The Cat Returns* | Hiroyuki Morita | Reiko Yoshida | Toshio SuzukiNozomu Takahashi\n | Yuji Nomi | July 19, 2002\n | 88%[113] | 70[114] |\n| 2004\n | *Howl's Moving Castle* | Hayao Miyazaki | Toshio Suzuki | Joe Hisaishi | November 20, 2004\n | 87%[115] | 82[116] |\n| 2006\n | *Tales from Earthsea* | Gorō Miyazaki | Gorō MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Tamiya Terashima\n | July 29, 2006\n | 38%[117] | 47[118] |\n| 2008\n | *Ponyo* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 19, 2008\n | 91%[119] | 86[120] |\n| 2010\n | *Arrietty* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hayao MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Cécile Corbel | July 17, 2010\n | 94%[121] | 80[122] |\n| 2011\n | *From Up on Poppy Hill* | Gorō Miyazaki | Satoshi Takebe | July 16, 2011\n | 87%[123] | 71[124] |\n| 2013\n | *The Wind Rises* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2013\n | 88%[125] | 83[126] |\n| *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* | Isao Takahata | Isao TakahataRiko Sakaguchi\n | Yoshiaki Nishimura | November 23, 2013\n | 100%[127] | 89[128] |\n| 2014\n | *When Marnie Was There* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hiromasa YonebayashiKeiko NiwaMasashi Ando | Takatsugu Muramatsu\n | July 19, 2014\n | 92%[129] | 72[130] |\n| 2016\n | *The Red Turtle* | Michaël Dudok de Wit | Michaël Dudok de WitPascale Ferran | Toshio SuzukiIsao TakahataVincent MaravalPascal CaucheteuxGrégoire Sorlat\n | Laurent Perez del Mar\n | May 18, 2016\n | 93%[131] | 86[132] |\n| 2020\n | *Earwig and the Witch* | Gorō Miyazaki | Keiko NiwaEmi Gunji\n | Toshio Suzuki\n | Satoshi Takebe\n | December 30, 2020[B]August 27, 2021[C] | 28%[133] | 46[134] |\n| 2023\n | *The Boy and the Heron* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 14, 2023\n | 98%[135] | 91[136] |\n\n\n1. **^** Originally broadcast on Nippon TV\n2. **^** First release on NHK General TV\n3. **^** Theatrical release\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Broadcast date\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987\n | *The Story of Yanagawa's Canals* | Isao Takahata | Susumu Kubo\n | Michio Mamiya | August 15, 1987 (NHK)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2014\n | *Ronja, the Robber's Daughter* | Gorō Miyazaki | Hiroyuki Kawasaki\n | Nobuo Kawakami\n | Satoshi Takebe | October 11, 2014–March 28, 2015 (NHK)\n | Anime television series based on *Ronia, the Robber's Daughter* by Astrid Lindgren |\n| 2022\n | *Zen – Grogu and Dust Bunnies*[137] | Katsuya Kondô\n |  | Tomohiko Ishii\n | Ludwig Göransson | November 12, 2022 (Disney+)\n | A *Star Wars* short film by Ghibli and Lucasfilm |\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hayao Miyazaki § Themes\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[138] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[139][140] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[141] Studio Ghibli’s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[142]\n\n\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[143] environmentalism and the natural world,[143][141] independent female protagonists,[139] the cost of war, and youth.[140]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nRayna Denison argues that, despite the feminist themes of Ghibli films, the studio has been reluctant to promote women within the company and regularly overworks its laborers, including on public holidays.[144]\n\n\nNathalie Pascaru and Maxim Tvorun-Dunn criticize the studio for what they see as the increasing commercialization of their films' iconography through plastic merchandise and tourist destinations, undermining the environmentalist themes of their films through industrial actions which are detrimental to the environment; as well as for turning their films' characters into decontextualized pop-culture references rather than multidimensional characters used to convey stories.[145]\n\n\n\n## Notable animators, background artists and character designers[edit]\n\n\n* Masashi Ando (*Paranoia Agent* and *Paprika*)\n* Makiko Futaki (*Akira*, *Angel's Egg*)\n* Katsuya Kondō (*Kiki's Delivery Service*, *Howl's Moving Castle*)\n* Kitarō Kōsaka (*Monster*, *Master Keaton*, and *Nasu*)\n* Kazuo Oga (*The Night of Taneyamagahara*, *My Neighbor Totoro*)\n* Kenichi Yoshida (*Overman King Gainer* and *Eureka Seven*)\n* Akihiko Yamashita (*Tide-Line Blue*, *Princess Nine*, *Strange Dawn*, and *Relic Armor Legacium*)\n* Hideaki Anno (*Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Neon Genesis Evangelion*)\n* Takashi Nakamura (*Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Akira*, *Robot Carnival* and *Catnapped!*)\n* Atsushi Takahashi (*Spirited Away*)\n* Takashi Watanabe (*Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Slayers*, *Boogiepop Phantom* and *Shakugan no Shana*)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Anime and manga portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![](image)Studio Ghibli portal\n* ![](image)Tokyo portal\n* ![icon](image)Animation portal\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo\n* Ghibli Park in Nagakute, Aichi\n* Studio Kajino, a subsidiary of Studio Ghibli\n* Yasuo Ōtsuka\n* Studio Ponoc, founded by former members of Studio Ghibli\n* List of Japanese animation studios\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Home video rights are held by Wild Bunch subsidiary Wild Side, with Warner Bros.

With a budget of US$19 million, production of *Spirited Away* began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nOriginally released in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho, the film received universal acclaim,[12] grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office.[a][13] Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥31.68 billion ($305 million).[14] It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train* in 2020.[15]\n\n\nA co-recipient of the Golden Bear with *Bloody Sunday* at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and the first, and to date only, hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards,[16] *Spirited Away* is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various \"best-of\" lists.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's plot summary **may be too long or excessively detailed.** Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. *(November 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nTen-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Her father stops to explore an abandoned amusement park despite Chihiro's protests. They find a restaurant stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents begin to eat. While exploring alone, Chihiro finds a bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to leave. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have become pigs, and the exit is blocked by an ocean of water.\n\n\nHaku finds Chihiro and leads her toward the bathhouse. She sees several animals and creatures visiting the bathhouse, as well as No-Face (顔無し, *Kaonashi*), a masked spirit. Haku instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji says that he already has enough susuwatari to help him. After Chihiro tries to help but inadvertently causes some disruption, Kamaji asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse.\n\n\nYubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but Chihiro persists. Eventually, Yubaba reveals she took an oath to give work to anyone who asks for it, and gives Chihiro a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name (千尋), renaming her Sen (千). Haku reveals he is also working for Yubaba.\n\n\nThe bathhouse workers dislike Sen, but give her work as Lin's assistant. Later that night, when Yubaba leaves, Haku finds Sen and shows her her parents, who are being held in pigpens. Haku explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world. Sen is ostracized by the other workers. While working, she invites No-Face inside, accidentally believing him to be a customer.\n\n\nThe spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's first customer. Sen discovers a bicycle handle sticking out of him, and the workers help to remove the bicycle and a large amount of garbage. He gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it before swallowing him. He demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers. Meanwhile, Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When he crashes into Yubaba's penthouse with grievous injuries, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami stows away on her back.\n\n\nNo-Face is given large amounts of food, but soon begins eating more workers. In the penthouse, the stowaway shikigami shapeshifts into Yubaba's sister, Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse. Sen, Haku, and Boh fall into the boiler room. Sen feeds Haku part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up a seal he stole, saving him from its deadly curse. Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba, taking Boh with her. She confronts an engorged No-Face, who reveals he is very lonely. Sen feeds No-Face the rest of the dumpling, and he follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Lin takes Sen to the station to see Zeniba, and Sen invites No-Face to follow, despite Lin's protests. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel with train tickets given to Sen by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing.\n\n\nHaku offers to retrieve Boh if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test. Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband. Haku appears in dragon form, and Sen, Boh, and Haku leave for the bathhouse, leaving No-Face with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen discovers Haku's identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, *Nigihayami Kohakunushi*). When they arrive, Sen passes Yubaba's test to identify her parents, and she is allowed to leave. Haku vows to see her again, but she leaves the city with her parents, who do not remember anything after the restaurant. After returning to their own world, the family find their car covered with leaves and dust, as the forest around it has become immensely overgrown. They then exit the forest and continue their journey to their new home.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Voice actor\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese (Nihongo)\n | Japanese\n | English\n |\n| Chihiro Ogino / Sen\n | *Ogino Chihiro* (荻野 千尋) / *Sen* (千)[b] | Rumi Hiiragi | Daveigh Chase |\n| Haku / Spirit of the Kohaku River\n | *Haku* (ハク) / *Nigihayami Kohakunushi* (饒速水小白主)[c] | Miyu Irino | Jason Marsden |\n| Yubaba\n | *Yubāba* (湯婆婆)[d] | Mari Natsuki | Suzanne Pleshette |\n| Zeniba\n | *Zeniiba* (銭婆)[e] |\n| Kamaji\n | *Kamajii* (釜爺)[f] | Bunta Sugawara | David Ogden Stiers |\n| Lin\n | *Rin* (リン) | Yoomi Tamai | Susan Egan |\n| Chichiyaku\n | *Chichiyaku* (父役)\n | Tsunehiko Kamijō | Paul Eiding |\n| Aniyaku (assistant Manager)\n | Aniyaku (兄役)\n | Takehiko Ono | John Ratzenberger |\n| No-Face[g] | *Kaonashi* (顔無し)[g] | Akio Nakamura | Bob Bergen |\n| Aogaeru\n | *Aogaeru* (青蛙)[h] | Tatsuya Gashūin |\n| Bandai-gaeru (foreman)\n | *Bandai-gaeru* (番台蛙)[i] | Yō Ōizumi | Rodger Bumpass |\n| Boh (baby)\n | *Bō* (坊)\n | Ryunosuke Kamiki | Tara Strong |\n| Akio Ogino (Chihiro's father)\n | *Ogino Akio* (荻野 明夫)\n | Takashi Naitō | Michael Chiklis |\n| Yūko Ogino (Chihiro's mother)\n | *Ogino Yūko* (荻野 悠子)\n | Yasuko Sawaguchi | Lauren Holly |\n| River Spirit\n | *Kawa no Kami* (河の神)\n | Koba Hayashi | Jim Ward |\n| Radish Spirit\n | *Oshira-sama* (お白様)[j] | Ken Yasuda | Jack Angel |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...]. [I]t's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances [...]. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Hayao Miyazaki[17]\n\nEvery summer, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for *Spirited Away* came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like *Nakayoshi* and *Ribon* the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they \"held dear in their hearts\" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.[17]\n\n\n\n![Close up photograph of Hayao Miyazaki, smiling and wearing a suit and tie in front of a gold-colored mosaic.](image)Hayao Miyazaki used shōjo manga magazines for inspiration to direct *Spirited Away*.\nMiyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals—one based on the Japanese book *Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi* (霧のむこうのふしぎな町) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine—were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming *Spirited Away*, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of *Spirited Away*.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese dragon ascends toward the heavens with Mount Fuji in the background in this print from Ogata Gekkō. *Spirited Away* is heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore.[8]\nProduction of *Spirited Away* commenced in February 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million).[2] Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film's production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution.[18][19] As with *Princess Mononoke*, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a \"pretty girl\". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked \"dull\" and thought, \"She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?\" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel \"she will be a charming woman.\"[17]\n\n\n\n![A medium shot photograph of a hot spring in the city of Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku, Japan.](image)Dōgo Onsen\n![A wide photograph of a hallway from the Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum, which was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.](image)The Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.Miyazaki based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the buildings in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes.\"[17] Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (能登谷旅館), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.[20] While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.[21] The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the *Spirited Away* onsen/bathhouse.[22]\n\n\nToshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of *Spirited Away*. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki's own influences by European films such as *The Snow Queen* and *The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep*.[23]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Spirited Away*\n\nThe film score of *Spirited Away* was composed and conducted by Miyazaki's regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic.[24] The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.[25][26][27] Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to \"One Summer's Day\" and named the new version of the song \"The Name of Life\" (いのちの名前, *\"Inochi no Namae\"*) which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.[28]\n\n\nThe closing song, \"Always With Me\" (いつも何度でも, *\"Itsumo Nando Demo\"*, lit. 'Always, No Matter How Many Times') was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka.[29] The lyrics were written by Kimura's friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for *Rin the Chimney Painter* (煙突描きのリン, *Entotsu-kaki no Rin*), a different Miyazaki film which was never released.[29] In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create *Spirited Away*.[29] The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.[30]\n\n\nBesides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled *Spirited Away Image Album* (千と千尋の神隠し　イメージアルバム, *Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Imēji Arubamu*), that contains 10 tracks.[31]\n\n\n\n### English dub[edit]\n\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing *Spirited Away* Lasseter was ecstatic.[32] Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing *Spirited Away* to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: *Beauty and the Beast* co-director Kirk Wise and *Aladdin* co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of *Spirited Away*, respectively.[32] Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nThe cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with *Spirited Away* being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of *Disney.com*; Disney had sidelined their official website for *Spirited Away*[32] and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.[19] Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Supernaturalism[edit]\n\n\nThe major themes of *Spirited Away*, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.[8] Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:\n\n\n> In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.[8]\n> \n> \n\nChihiro's archetypal entrance into another world demarcates her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word *kamikakushi* (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'\"[33]\n\n\nAdditional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Fantasy[edit]\n\n\nThe film has been compared to Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass*, as the stories have some elements in common such as being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.[35][36][37] Among other stories compared to *Spirited Away*, *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* is seen to be more closely linked thematically.[36]\n\n\nYubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film *Pinocchio*, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child,[38] who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.[38]\n\n\n\n### Traditional Japanese culture[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.[39] Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the *shōjo*, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.[39] Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.[38] In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.[40]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy plays a huge role in *Spirited Away*, specifically through concepts like *Kami* and principles like *Mottainai* and *On*.[41] The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro's character development.\n\n\n\n### Western consumerism[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to the Japanese concept of *On*, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture.[42] For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees' quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of *chi*, the first character in Chihiro's name, lit. 'one thousand') can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value.[39]\n\n\n\nMiyazaki's film setting encapsulates his commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan's distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film's visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis – the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has \"credit cards and cash\", before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits.[43] Miyazaki has stated:\n\n\n> Chihiro's parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that \"turned into pigs\" during Japan's bubble economy (consumer society) of the 1980s, and these people still haven't realized they've become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don't return to being human but instead gradually start to have the \"body and soul of a pig\". These people are the ones saying, \"We are in a recession and don't have enough to eat.\" This doesn't just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) \"a trap to catch lost humans\".[42]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.[44] Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;[39] it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face.[45] In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.[39]\n\n\n\n### Environmentalism[edit]\n\n\nCommentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In *Spirited Away*, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.[46]\n\n\nThe second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.[47][48]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Box office and theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record ¥1.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by *Princess Mononoke*.[49] It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total.[50] After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001.[51] It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States.[52][53] It went on to gross ¥30.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan.[54] It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by *Titanic*.[55] Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to ¥31.68 billion, as of 2020[update].[56][57]\n\n\nIn February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France.[58] The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.[59]\n\n\nDisney's English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002[60] and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. *Spirited Away* had very little marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002.[19] After the 2003 Oscars,[61] it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003.[62] Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively.[63] In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.[64]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003.[65] The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003.[66][67] The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.[68]\n\n\nAbout 18 years after its original release in Japan, *Spirited Away* had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It follows the theatrical China release of *My Neighbour Totoro* in December 2018.[69] The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[70] It topped the Chinese box office with a $28.8-million opening weekend, beating *Toy Story 4* in China.[71] In its second weekend, *Spirited Away* grossed a cumulative $54.8 million in China, and was second only behind *Spider-Man: Far From Home* that weekend.[72] As of 16 July 2019[update], the film has grossed $70 million in China,[73] bringing its worldwide total box office to over $346 million as of 8 July 2019[update].[74]\n\n\n*Spirited Away*'s worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.[a]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was first released on VHS and DVD formats in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002.[75] The Japanese DVD releases include storyboards for the film and the special edition includes a Ghibli DVD player.[76] *Spirited Away* sold 5.5 million home video units in Japan by 2007,[77] and holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in the country as of 2014[update].[78] The movie was released on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Japan on 14 July 2014, and DVD was also reissued on the same day with a new HD master, alongside several other Studio Ghibli movies.[79][80]\n\n\nIn North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003.[81] The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller.[82] The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and *The Art of Spirited Away*, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden.[83] The movie was released on Blu-ray by and North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 16 June 2015.[84] GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017 following the expiration of Disney's previous deal with Studio Ghibli in the country in North America.[85] On 12 November 2019, GKIDS and Shout! Factory issued a North-America-exclusive *Spirited Away* collector's edition, which includes the film on Blu-ray, and the film's soundtrack on CD, as well as a 40-page book with statements by Toshio Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki, and essays by film critic Kenneth Turan and film historian Leonard Maltin.[86][87] Along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli films, *Spirited Away* was released on digital markets in the United States for the first time, on 17 December 2019.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and VHS as a rental release through independent distributor High Fliers Films PLC following the film's limited theatrical release. It was later officially released on DVD in the UK on 29 March 2004, with the distribution being done by Optimum Releasing themselves.[88] In 2006, the DVD was reissued as a single-disc release (without the second one) with packaging matching other releases in Optimum's \"The Studio Ghibli Collection\" range.[89] The then-renamed StudioCanal UK released the movie on Blu-ray on 24 November 2014, A British 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition, similar to other Studio Ghibli anniversary editions released in the UK, was released on 25 October 2021.[90]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2015 Blu-ray release grossed $9,925,660 from 557,613 physical units sold as of 21 February 2021[update].[91] In the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015,[92] number five in 2016,[93] and number one in 2019.[94]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on 24 January 2003. It became NTV's most-watched film of all time with a 46.9% audience rating, surpassing the 35.1% record previously set by *Princess Mononoke* in 1999.[95]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 670,000 viewers on BBC2 in 2010. This made it the year's most-watched foreign-language film on BBC, and the year's second highest foreign film on UK television (below the Indian Bollywood film *Om Shanti Om*).[96] *Spirited Away* was later watched by 300,000 UK viewers on BBC2 in 2011, making it the year's most-watched foreign-language film on BBC2.[97] Combined, the film drew a 970,000 UK television viewership on BBC2 between 2010 and 2011.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* received widespread acclaim. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"*Spirited Away* is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by the world around them.\"[98] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 96 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[12]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film a full four stars, praising the work and Miyazaki's direction. Ebert also said that *Spirited Away* was one of \"the year's best films\", as well as adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list.[99] Elvis Mitchell of *The New York Times* positively reviewed the film and praised the animation. Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*, and wrote that Miyazaki's \"movies are as much about moodiness as mood\" and that \"the prospect of animated figures' not being what they seem – either spiritually or physically – heightens the tension.\"[37] Derek Elley of *Variety* said that *Spirited Away* \"can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike\" and praised the animation and music.[100] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* praised Miyazaki's direction and the voice acting, as well as saying that the film is the \"product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before.\"[101] *Orlando Sentinel*'s critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki's direction and said the film is \"the perfect choice for a child who has moved into a new home.\"[102]\n\n\nIn 2004, *Cinefantastique* listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".[103] In 2005, *Spirited Away* was ranked by IGN as the 12th-best animated film of all time.[104] The film is also ranked number 9 of the highest-rated movies of all time on Metacritic, being the highest rated traditionally animated film on the site.

In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki's wide impact to the film industry, he wrote \"The influence of *Spirited Away* can be easily observed in Disney productions like *Brave* and *Frozen*, thanks to John Lasseter's (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences\".[126][127] *Vice* also declared *Spirited Away* to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film \"showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be\" that \"Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later\".[128]\n\n\nFilm director Steven Spielberg said that *Spirited Away* might be \"better than any Disney films\" he has ever seen.[129] Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told *Time* that \"This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time\".[130] The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at *Spirited Away* and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in *Coco*.[131] Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore \"ideas of morality and humanity\" in *Eternals*.[132] *Turning Red*'s director Domee Shi named *Spirited Away* as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Commercial and cultural significance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Time*, *Spirited Away* \"arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works\" but it \"shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world\". Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney \"boosted *Spirited Away*'s visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards\", and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[134] Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film's Oscar win was \"a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years\".[135] Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called *Spirited Away*'s wins at major Western award shows \"a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry\". She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as \"childish, vulgar, things that you didn't take seriously\" but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as \"a real art form\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nA stage adaptation of *Spirited Away* was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli's blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi.[137][138] In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024.[139]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Main Cast\n |\n| --- |\n| Character name\n | Actor (Double Cast)\n |\n| *Chihiro* (千尋)\n | Kanna Hashimoto | Mone Kamishiraishi |\n| *Haku* (ハク)\n | Kotarou Daigo\n | Hiroki Miura |\n| *Kaonashi* (顔無し)\n | Koharu Sugawara | Tomohiko Tsujimoto\n |\n| *Rin* (リン)\n | Miyu Sakihi\n | Fuu Hinami\n |\n| *Kamajī* (釜爺)\n | Tomorowo Taguchi | Satoshi Hashimoto |\n| *Yubāba* (湯婆婆) / *Zenība* (銭婆)\n | Mari Natsuki | Romi Park |\n\n\n### Limited time re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn a limited time release from 11 November to 18 December in 2022,[140][141] the Imperial Theater performance of the play was available for rental in Japan in several streaming services such as Abema, Amazon Prime Video Japan, Docomo Anime Store, FOD, Hulu Japan and U-Next.[142]\n\n\nThere were 2 versions of the play available for rental:\n\n\n\n* **Stage \"Spirited Away\" (Chihiro role: Kanna Hashimoto) ≪Imperial Theater performance version≫ (First distribution)**.

The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD) and includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (*kami*) of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. The term *mononoke* (物の怪, or もののけ) is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.\n\n\nThe film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, by Toho, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. This was the first Studio Ghibli film in the United States to be rated PG-13 by the MPA. It was a critical and commercial blockbuster, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's *Spirited Away*, another Miyazaki film. It was dubbed into English with a script by Neil Gaiman and initially distributed in North America by Miramax, where it sold well on home media despite not performing strongly at the box office.[2] The film greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curse him before its death. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes him pain and will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\n\n\nHeading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant Night Walker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gun shot. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then manages to rescue two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the Great Forest Spirit.\n\n\nAshitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for outcasts and lepers employed to process iron and create firearms, such as hand cannons and matchlock muskets. Ashitaka learns that the town was built by clearcutting forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano, a local daimyō, and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into the demon that attacked Ashitaka's village. She also reveals that San, dubbed Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves and hates humankind.\n\n\nSan infiltrates Iron Town to kill Eboshi. Ashitaka intervenes and subdues Eboshi and San while they are in combat. Amidst the hysteria he is shot by a villager, but the curse gives him strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo. Eboshi intends to give the god's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality) in return for protection from Lord Asano, while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.\n\n\nAshitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano's samurai. The boar clan has been annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo's men trick Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka saves San while the Forest Spirit euthanizes Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Night Walker Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while the Forest Spirit's body bleeds ooze that spreads over the land and kills anything it touches. The forest and its spirits begin to die. Moro's head briefly comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives. Enraged, San attempts to kill Eboshi, but is stopped by Ashitaka, who consoles her and encourages her not to give up.\n\n\nAfter Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing it and lifting Ashitaka's curse. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi vows to build a better town and the forest begins to regrow.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Novelist Ali Shaw has described Yakul as being more similar to a red Lechwe than an elk. Miyazaki called Ashitaka a \"melancholic boy who has a fate\" and stated that Ashitaka's curse \"is similar to the lives of people [at the time]\".[5] Ashitaka's English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as \"an unexpected hero. He's not your usual wild, brave guy. He's really just a young, earnest man who's trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village.\"\n* Yuriko Ishida voices San (サン), a young woman who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans, but eventually comes to care for Ashitaka. In the English version, San is voiced by Claire Danes.\n\t+ Ishida also voices Kaya (カヤ), Ashitaka's bride-elect who breaks the rules of the village to gift him her dagger to remember her by.[6] Tara Strong provides her voice in the English version, where she is referred to as his younger sister due to the translation.\n* Yūko Tanaka provides the voice of Lady Eboshi (エボシ御前, *Eboshi Gozen*), the ruler of Irontown who continually clears the forest. Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film.[5] Miyazaki said that Eboshi has a strong and secure personality, evident in the fact that she let Ashitaka move freely through the settlement unescorted, despite his unclear motives. He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperor's authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she would not hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams. Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a shirabyōshi.[7] Eboshi's English voice actress Minnie Driver stated that she was interested in \"the challenge of playing [a] woman who supports industry and represents the interests of man, in terms of achievement and greed.\" Driver viewed Eboshi as \"a warrior, an innovator and a protector.\"\n* Kaoru Kobayashi provides the voice of Jiko-bō (ジコ坊, called \"Jigo\" in the English version), a monk and mercenary who befriends Ashitaka on his journey to the west. Miyazaki was unsure whether to make Jiko-bō a government spy, a ninja, a member of a religious group or \"a very good guy.\" He eventually decided to give him elements of all of the above groups.[5] In the English version, Jigo is voiced by Billy Bob Thornton.\n* Masahiko Nishimura voices Kohroku (甲六, *Kōroku*), an ox driver; John DeMita voices Kohroku in the English version. Miyazaki wrote Kohroku to be \"an ordinary guy [who] didn't do anything heroic, right to the end\", something he stated was contrary to films he had made up to that point.[5]\n* Tsunehiko Kamijō provides the voice of Gonza (ゴンザ), Eboshi's short-tempered but loyal bodyguard; he is voiced by John DiMaggio in the English version.\n* Akihiro Miwa voices Moro (モロの君, *Moro no Kimi*), a giant wolf god and San's adopted mother; Gillian Anderson provides her voice in the English version.\n* Mitsuko Mori provides the voice of Hii-sama (ヒイ様), the wise woman of Ashitaka's village. In the English version, Hii-sama is voiced by Debi Derryberry.\n* Hisaya Morishige provides the voice of Okkoto-nushi (乙事主, called \"Okkoto\" in the English version), a blind boar god. In the English version, Okkoto is voiced by Keith David, who also voices the narrator in the film's opening sequence.\n\n\nThe cast also includes:\n\n\n\n* Akira Nagoya as the cattleman leader (牛飼いの長, *Ushikai no Osa*);\n* Kimihiro Reizei as a Jibashiri (ジバシリ);\n* Tetsu Watanabe as a mountain wolf (山犬, *Yamainu*);\n* Makoto Sato as Nago (ナゴの守, *Nago no Mori*), a wild boar turned into a demon who curses Ashitaka when he attacks the Emishi village, voiced by John DiMaggio in the English version;\n* and Sumi Shimamoto as Toki (トキ), Kohroku's wife, a former prostitute, and the leader of Eboshi's women, voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith in the English version.\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Some of the film's natural scenery was inspired by Miyazaki's visit to the forests of Yakushima.[8]\nIn the late 1970s, Miyazaki drew sketches of a film about a princess living in the woods with a beast.[9] Miyazaki began writing the film's plotline and drew the initial storyboards for the film in August 1994.[10][11] He had difficulties adapting his early ideas and visualisations, because elements had already been used in *My Neighbor Totoro* and because of societal changes since the creation of the original sketches and image boards. This writer's block prompted him to accept a request for the creation of the *On Your Mark* promotional music video for the Chage and Aska song of the same title. According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of *Princess Mononoke*. In April 1995, supervising animator Masashi Ando devised the character designs from Miyazaki's storyboard. In May 1995, Miyazaki and Ando went to the ancient forests of Yakushima, of Kyushu, an inspiration for the landscape of *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, and the mountains of Shirakami-Sanchi in northern Honshu[12][13] for location scouting along with a group of art directors, background artists and digital animators for three days.[10] Animation production commenced in July 1995.[11] Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000 cels in the film,[14][15] and is estimated to have retouched parts of 80,000 of them.[16] The final storyboards of the film's ending were finished only months before the Japanese premiere date.[17]\n\n\nInspired by John Ford, an Irish-American director best known for his Westerns, Miyazaki created Irontown as a \"tight-knit frontier town\" and populated it with \"characters from outcast groups and oppressed minorities who rarely, if ever, appear in Japanese films.\" He made the characters \"yearning, ambitious and tough.\"[18][*non-primary source needed*] Miyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of Medieval Japan, and wanted to \"portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization.\"[19][*non-primary source needed*] Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of *Princess Mononoke* depicts a \"symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races (the Jomon, Yamato and Emishi).\"[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)3D rendering was used to create writhing demon flesh and composite it onto a hand-drawn Ashitaka.\n*Princess Mononoke* was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million).[21][22][23][*better source needed*] It was mostly hand-drawn, but incorporates some use of computer animation in approximately ten percent of the film.[24] The computer-animated parts are designed to blend in and support the traditional cel animation, and are mainly used in images consisting of a mixture of computer-generated graphics and traditional drawing. A further 10 minutes uses digital ink and paint, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films.[25] Telecom Animation Film Company and Oh! Production helped animate the film. Toei Animation and DR Movie helped with the painting process.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTwo titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as *Princess Mononoke*. The other title can be translated into English as *The Legend of Ashitaka* (アシタカ𦻙記, *Ashitaka Sekki*), and it contains an uncommon kanji 𦻙 that represents \"a legend passed down from ear to ear without being recorded in official history\", according to Miyazaki. In a Tokyo Broadcasting System program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Miyazaki had preferred *The Legend of Ashitaka* as the title while Suzuki himself favoured *Princess Mononoke*, though the former title was eventually reused for the first song on the soundtrack.[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"Princess Mononoke\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nA central theme of *Princess Mononoke* is the environment.[28] The film centers on the adventure of Ashitaka as he journeys to the west to undo a fatal curse inflicted upon him by Nago, a boar turned into a demon by Eboshi.[29] Michelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film \"makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters\". In the case of the deer god's destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the \"supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources\".[30] They also characterized Eboshi as a businesswoman who has a desire to make money at the expense of the forest, and also cite Eboshi's intention to destroy the forest to mine the mountain \"embodies environmentalist evil\".[29] Deirdre M. Pike writes that Princess Mononoke is simultaneously part of nature and part of the problem.[31] Mononoke represents the connection between the environment and humans, but also demonstrates that there is an imbalance in power between the two.[31]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality and disability[edit]\n\n\nTwo other themes found in the plot of *Princess Mononoke* are sexuality and disability. Speaking at the International Symposium on Leprosy / Hansen's Disease History in Tokyo, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, \"said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma\", after visiting the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium near his home in Tokyo.[32] Lady Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to \"cure [her] poor lepers\".[33] Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the University of Wyoming, and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that \"embraces modern social systems, such as industrialization, gendered division of labor, institutionalization of people with diseases, and militarization of men and women.\" They likened Lady Eboshi to a monarch.[34] Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshi's disregard of ancient laws and curses towards sex workers and lepers was enlightenment reasoning and her exploitation of disabled people furthered her modernist viewpoints.[35] Kim and Jarman conclude that Lady Eboshi's supposed benevolence in incorporating lepers and sex workers into her society leverages the social stigma attached to marginalized groups, pointing out that the hierarchical structures within Irontown still support the stigmatization of lepers and sex workers.[36]\n\n\n\n### Development versus preservation[edit]\n\n\nAn additional theme is the morally ambiguous conflict between humankind's growth and development and Nature's need for preservation. According to the *Chicago Sun-Times*'s Roger Ebert, \"It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.\"[37] Billy Crudup, who provided the English voice for Ashitaka, said \"The movie was such an entirely different experience; it had a whole new sensibility I had never seen in animation. It also had something profound to say: that there has to be a give and take between man and nature. One of the things that really impressed me is that Miyazaki shows life in all its multi-faceted complexity, without the traditional perfect heroes and wicked villains. Even Lady Eboshi, who Ashitaka respects, is not so much evil as short-sighted.\" Minnie Driver, the English voice actress for Lady Eboshi, commented similarly: \"It's one of the most remarkable things about the film: Miyazaki gives a complete argument for both sides of the battle between technological achievement and our spiritual roots in the forest. He shows that good and evil, violence and peace exist in us all. It's all about how you harmonize it all.\"[*citation needed*] Anime historian Susan J. Napier said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in *Princess Mononoke*, unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple points of view the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.[38]\n\n\n\n### Loss of innocence[edit]\n\n\nDan Jolin of *Empire* said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, *Porco Rosso*, and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as *Kiki's Delivery Service*, where he has been quoted as saying \"It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we're happy?\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Duality[edit]\n\n\nDuality is central to Eboshi's characterization. Benjamin Thevenin, Assistant Professor of Theater and Media Arts at Brigham Young University, said Eboshi does not fully understand the harm she does to the spirits. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a haven for former sex workers and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontown's inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to help her own people. Thevenin concluded that although Eboshi can be seen as the film's villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general.[40]\n\n\n\n### Non-duality[edit]\n\n\nAt first glance Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke suggest a very dualistic and dichotomous view of life. Lady Eboshi works for the survival of humankind and San for the survival of nature. But Miyazaki, through the character of Ashitaka, argues that we should accept a non-dualistic view of living, accepting that nature and humans coexist. Ashitaka acts as a healer, mediating between humanity and nature. Ashitaka's curse, obtained while defending his people from a demonized boar god, ultimately symbolizes the destructive force of life, forcing him to recognize the commonalities present in the conflict between industrialized society and nature. Ashitaka’s quest for a cure by the Great Forest Spirit symbolizes humanity’s quest to find a way to live on earth that accepts the interbeing of all of earth's creatures. Ashitaka takes responsibility for the preservation and restoration of nature when he returns the Great Forest Spirit’s head, transferring the guardianship of nature from the now dead Great Forest Spirit to humanity. With guardianship of nature delegated to humanity, the dichotomy between humanity and nature is dismantled and the two forces are tasked with recognizing their coexistence.[41]\n\n\n\n### Individualism and conformity[edit]\n\n\nAnother theme in this film is between individualism and societal conformity. According to University of Bristol professors Christos Ellinas, Neil Allan and Anders Johansson, this struggle can be seen between San, a strong individualistic force, and Eboshi, the leader of a great society. San has fully committed to living with the wolves in the forest and to renouncing her association with the human race. Eboshi has vowed to sustain her society of Irontown by any means including destroying the environment. The people of Irontown have a cohesive ideology and agree with Eboshi to protect Irontown at the cost of the environment's destruction. This conformity can be found within their society, because \"even though there is an envisioned culture which an organization abides to, achieving coherence at lower aggregation levels (e.g. individuals) is increasingly challenging due to its emergent nature\".[42]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997.[43] The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both anime fans and arthouse moviegoers in English-speaking countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSince Walt Disney Studios had made a distribution deal with Tokuma Shoten for Studio Ghibli's films in 1996, it was the first film from Studio Ghibli along with *Kiki's Delivery Service* and *Castle in the Sky* to have been dubbed into English by Disney; in this case, subsidiary Miramax Films was assigned to release the movie in the US on October 29, 1999.[*citation needed*] In response to demands from Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein to edit the film, Toshio Suzuki sent Weinstein a samurai sword with the message: \"No cuts.\"[44][45] Promotion manager Steve Alpert revealed that Weinstein had wanted to trim the film down from 135 minutes to 90 minutes \"despite having promised not to do so.\" When Alpert informed him that Miyazaki would not agree to these demands, Weinstein flew into one of his infamous rages and threatened Alpert that he would \"never work in this...industry again\".[45]\n\n\nWeinstein hired Neil Gaiman to write the English script, and he chose to simplify some of the Japanese terminology for this dub, with words like *Jibarashi* becoming \"Mercenary\" and *Shishigami* becoming \"Forest Spirit\". According to him at one of the American screenings of the dub, the release was somewhat delayed because the original recordings deviated from the English script as written.[*citation needed*] Despite Gaiman's independent fame as an author, his role as scriptwriter for the dub was not heavily promoted: Studio Ghibli requested that Miramax remove some executives' names from the poster for the film, but the executives (Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein, and Scott Martin) decided that Gaiman's name was contractually expendable.[46]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2000, the English-dub version of *Princess Mononoke* was released theatrically in Japan along with the documentary *Mononoke hime in U.S.A.*[43] The documentary was directed by Toshikazu Sato and featured Miyazaki visiting the Walt Disney Studios and various film festivals.[47] The film had a limited theatrical re-release in the United States during July 2018,[48] and again during April 2022 for the 25th anniversary of its original Japanese release.[49]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* was the highest-grossing Japanese film of 1997, earning ¥11.3 billion in distribution rental earnings.[50] It became the highest-grossing film in Japan, beating the record set by *E.T.* in 1982, but was surpassed several months later by *Titanic*.[51] The film earned total domestic gross receipts of ¥20.18 billion.[52]\n\n\nIt was the top-grossing anime film in the United States in January 2001, but because its US release was only in select theaters, the film did not fare as well financially in the country when released in October 1999. It grossed $2,298,191 for the first eight weeks.[53][48] It showed more strength internationally, where it earned a total of $11 million outside Japan, bringing its worldwide total to $159,375,308 at the time.[48] On December 6, 2016, GKIDS announced that it would screen the film in US cinemas on January 5 and January 9, 2017, to celebrate its 20th anniversary,[54] bundled with the *On Your Mark* short.[55] The film's limited US re-release in 2018 grossed $1,423,877 over five days, bringing its US total to $3,799,185 and worldwide total to $160,799,185.[48] As of 2020[update], the film has grossed $194.3 million.[1]\n\n\nFor its 25th anniversary, Princess Mononoke was screened in 35mm at New York City's Japan Society on July 22, 2022.[56]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the film was released on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on June 26, 1998. A LaserDisc edition was also released by Tokuma Japan Communications on the same day. The film was released on DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on November 21, 2001, with bonus extras added, including the international versions of the film as well as the storyboards.[*citation needed*] By 2007, *Princess Mononoke* sold 4.4 million DVD units in Japan.[57]\n\n\nIn July 2000, Buena Vista Home Entertainment via Miramax Home Entertainment announced plans to release the film on VHS and DVD in North America on August 29.[58] Initially, the DVD version of *Princess Mononoke* wasn't going to include the Japanese-language track at the request of Buena Vista's Japan division. Because the film hadn't been released on DVD in Japan yet, there were concerns that \"a foreign-released DVD containing the Japanese language track will allow for the importation of such a DVD to Japan, which could seriously hurt the local sales of a future release of the [film]\".[59] The fansite Nausicaa.net organized an email campaign for fans to include the Japanese language track,[59] while DVD Talk began an online petition to retain the Japanese language track.[60] The DVD release of *Princess Mononoke* was delayed as a result.[61] Miramax Home Entertainment released the DVD on December 19, 2000 with the original Japanese audio, the English dubbed audio and extras including a trailer and a documentary with interviews from the English dub voice actors.[62] The film was released on Blu-ray disc in Japan on December 4, 2013.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Princess Mononoke* on Blu-ray Disc on November 18, 2014.[*citation needed*] In its first week, it sold 21,860 units; by November 23, 2014, it had grossed $502,332.[63] It was later included in Disney's \"The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki\" Blu-ray set, released on November 17, 2015.[64] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[65] As of October 2020[update], the film has grossed $9,232,906 from Blu-ray sales in the United States.[63]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015 (below five other Studio Ghibli anime films),[66] number ten in 2016,[67] number five in 2018 (below four other Japanese films),[68] and number three in 2019 (below *Spirited Away* and *My Neighbor Totoro*).[69]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on January 22, 1999. It was NTV's second-most-watched film at the time with a 35.1% audience rating, below *Spirited Away*.[70]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 117 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads, \"With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, *Princess Mononoke* is a landmark in the world of animation.\"[71] On Metacritic, it has an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indictating \"generally favorable reviews\".[72]\n\n\n*The Daily Yomiuri*'s Aaron Gerow called the film a \"powerful compilation of Miyazaki's world, a cumulative statement of his moral and filmic concerns.\"[73] Leonard Klady of *Variety* said that *Princess Mononoke* \"is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script\" and the film \"has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema's most grand canvases\".[74] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called *Princess Mononoke* \"a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year. […] You won't find many Hollywood love stories (animated or otherwise) so philosophical.\"[75] Ty Burr of *Entertainment Weekly* called the film \"a windswept pinnacle of its art\" and that it \"has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story\".[76] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* said that the film \"brings a very different sensibility to animation, a medium [Miyazaki] views as completely suitable for straight dramatic narrative and serious themes.\"[77] In his review, Dave Smith from *Gamers' Republic* called it \"one of the greatest animated films ever created, and easily one of the best films of 1999.\"[78]\n\n\nRoger Ebert placed *Princess Mononoke* sixth on his top ten movies of 1999.[79] In 2001, the Japanese magazine *Animage* ranked *Princess Mononoke* 47th in their list of *100 Best Anime Productions of All Time*.[80] It ranked 488th on *Empire*'s list of the 500 greatest films.[81] Time Out ranked the film 26th on 50 greatest animated films.[82] It also ranked 26 on *Total Film'*s list of 50 greatest animated films.[83]\n\n\nJames Cameron cited *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on his 2009 film *Avatar*. He acknowledged that it shares themes with *Princess Mononoke*, including its clash between cultures and civilizations, and cited *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[84]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is the first animated feature film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Best Picture.[85] For the 70th Academy Awards ceremony, *Princess Mononoke* was the Japanese submission to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not successfully nominated.[86] Hayao Miyazaki was also nominated for an Annie Award for his work on the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | 52nd Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Princess Mononoke* | Won\n | [87] |\n| Best Animation Film | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| Japanese Movie Fans' Choice\n | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| 10th Nikkan Sports Film Awards | Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki\n | [*citation needed*] |\n| Yūjirō Ishihara Award | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| 1st Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 1998\n | 21st Japan Academy Awards | Picture of the Year | *Princess Mononoke* | [85] |\n| 40th Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 22nd Hochi Film Awards | Special Award\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 2000\n | 28th Annie Awards | Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production\n | Hayao Miyazaki  (English language version)\n | Nominated\n | [88] |\n| 4th Golden Satellite Awards | Best Animated or Mixed Media Film\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 2001\n | 27th Saturn Awards | Best Home Video Release\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Won\n | [*citation needed*] |\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The music was performed by Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Hiroshi Kumagai. The soundtrack was released in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications on July 2, 1997, and the North American version was released by Milan Records on October 12, 1999.\n\n\nThe titular theme song was performed by counter-tenor Yoshikazu Mera. For the English adaptation, Sasha Lazard sang the song.\nDuring the movie Hisaishi makes use of a few known classical pieces and quotes them, such as Dmitri Shostakovich's 5th symphony.\nAs with other Studio Ghibli films, additional albums featuring soundtrack themes in alternative versions have been released. The image album features early versions of the themes, recorded at the beginning of the film production process, and used as source of inspiration for the various artists involved. The symphonic suite features longer compositions, each encompassing several of the movie themes, performed by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mario Klemens.\n\n\n\n## Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that Studio Ghibli and British theatre company Whole Hog Theatre would be bringing *Princess Mononoke* to the stage. It is the first stage adaptation of a Studio Ghibli work.[89] The contact between Whole Hog Theatre and Studio Ghibli was facilitated by Nick Park of Aardman Animations after he sent footage of Whole Hog performances to Studio Ghibli's Toshio Suzuki.[90] The play features large puppets made out of recycled and reclaimed materials.[91]\n\n\nThe first performances were scheduled for London's New Diorama Theatre and sold out in 72 hours, a year in advance.[92][93] In March 2013, it was announced that the show would transfer to Japan after its first run of shows in London. A second series of performances followed in London after the return from Tokyo. The second run of London performances sold out in four and half hours.[94][95] The play received positive reviews and was one of Lyn Gardner's theatre picks in *The Guardian*.[96][97][98][99][100] On April 27, 2013, the play was presented at Nico Nico Douga's Cho Party and was streamed online in Japan.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Loo, Egan (December 15, 2020). \"Spirited Away, 3 Other Ghibli Films' Box Office Totals Rose Due to This Year's Revival Screenings\". *Anime News Network*.

She calls him \"Anisama (older brother)\", but it just means that he is an older boy in her clan.  \n**Q:** So they are not real brother and sister.  \n**M:** If they were, that wouldn't be interesting at all. There used to be a lot of marriage among blood relations in Japan. I thought of Kaya as a girl who is determined to do so (marry Ashitaka). But Ashitaka chose San. It's not strange at all to live with San, who lives with such a brutal fate. That's life.`{{cite web}}`: CS1 maint: others (link)\n7. **^** Leavey, John (2010). \"Possessed by and of: Up against Seeing: Princess Mononoke\". *ImageTexT*. **5** (2). University of Florida.

Many are perfect the way they are. That that makes me very gratified. My job is to maintain overall, in every cel, a standard that I have set for the film.

It stars the voices of Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto and Hitoshi Takagi, and focuses on two young sisters and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.\n\n\nIn 1989, Streamline Pictures produced an English-language dub for exclusive use on transpacific flights of Japan Airlines. Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film. This dub was released in 1993 to United States theaters, and the following year on VHS and LaserDisc in the US by Fox Video in 1994, and on DVD in 2002. The rights to this dub expired in 2004, so Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the film on March 7, 2006 with a new dub cast.[1] This DVD release is the first version of the film in the US to include both Japanese and English language tracks.\n\n\nThe film explores themes such as animism, Shinto symbology, environmentalism and the joys of rural living. *My Neighbor Totoro* received worldwide critical acclaim, and has grossed over $41 million worldwide at the box office as of September 2019; the film also grossed significantly more from home video sales and merchandise.\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* received numerous awards, including the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, the Mainichi Film Award, and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the Blue Ribbon Awards in the same year. The film is considered as one of the top animation films, ranking 41st in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010 and the number-one animated film on the 2012 *Sight & Sound* critics' poll of all-time greatest films.[2][3] The film and its titular character have become cultural icons, and made multiple cameo appearances in other films. Totoro also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called *susuwatari*, that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.[note 1] The *susuwatari* leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book *Three Billy Goats Gruff*. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSatsuki and Mei's house [ja] at the Expo 2005 site\n![](image)\nCloseup view of Satsuki and Mei's house\n\nThe girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\n\n\nThe girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.\n\n\nEventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nAnimism is a major theme in *My Neighbor Totoro*, according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.[4] Totoro has animistic traits and has *kami* status because he lives in a camphor tree in a Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope, and he is referred to as *mori no nushi* (master of the forest).[4] Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a *kami*.[4] According to Phillip E. Wegner, the film is an example of alternative history, citing the utopian-like setting of the anime.[5]\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Japanese voice actor[6]: 175 | English voice actor(Tokuma/Streamline/50th Street Films, 1989/1993)[7] | English voice actor(Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2005)[7] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Satsuki Kusakabe (草壁 サツキ) (10-year-old daughter) | Noriko Hidaka | Lisa Michelson | Dakota Fanning |\n| Mei Kusakabe (草壁 メイ) (4-year-old daughter) | Chika Sakamoto | Cheryl Chase | Elle Fanning |\n| Tatsuo Kusakabe (草壁 タツオ) (father) | Shigesato Itoi | Greg Snegoff | Tim Daly |\n| Yasuko Kusakabe (草壁 靖子) (mother) | Sumi Shimamoto | Alexandra Kenworthy | Lea Salonga |\n| Totoro (トトロ) | Hitoshi Takagi | — | Frank Welker |\n| Kanta Ōgaki (大垣 勘太) (a local boy) | Toshiyuki Amagasa | Kenneth Hartman | Paul Butcher |\n| Granny (祖母) (Nanny in the 1993 dub) | Tanie Kitabayashi | Natalie Core | Pat Carroll |\n| Catbus (ネコバス, **Nekobasu**) | Naoki Tatsuta | Carl Macek (uncredited) | Frank Welker |\n| Michiko (ミチ子) | Chie Kōjiro | Brianne Siddall (uncredited) | Ashley Rose Orr\n |\n| Mrs. Ogaki (Kanta's mother) | Hiroko Maruyama | Melanie MacQueen | Kath Soucie |\n| Mr. Ogaki (Kanta's father) | Masashi Hirose | Steve Kramer | David Midthunder\n |\n| Old Farmer | — | Peter Renaday |\n| Miss Hara (Satsuki's teacher) | Machiko Washio | Edie Mirman (uncredited) | Tress MacNeille (uncredited)\n |\n| Kanta's Aunt | Reiko Suzuki | Russi Taylor |\n| Otoko | Daiki Nakamura | Kerrigan Mahan (uncredited) | Matt Adler |\n| Ryōko | Yūko Mizutani | Lara Cody | Bridget Hoffman |\n| Bus Attendant | — | Kath Soucie |\n| Mailman | Tomomichi Nishimura | Doug Stone (uncredited) | Robert Clotworthy |\n| Moving Man | Shigeru Chiba | Greg Snegoff | Newell Alexander\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nAfter working on *3000 Miles in Search of a Mother*, Miyazaki wanted to make a \"delightful, wonderful film\" that would be set in Japan with the idea to \"entertain and touch its viewers, but stay with them long after they have left the theaters\".[6] Initially, Miyazaki had the main characters Totoro, Mei, Tatsuo, and Kanta.[6]: 8 The director based Mei on his niece,[8] and Totoros as \"serene, carefree creatures\" that were \"supposedly the forest keeper, but that's only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation\".[6]: 5, 103\n\n\nArt director Kazuo Oga was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a *satoyama*. Miyazaki challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with *My Neighbor Totoro* began Oga's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the film's color palette; Oga wanted to paint black soil from Akita Prefecture and Miyazaki preferred the color of red soil from Kantō region.[6]: 82 The finished film was described by Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki; \"It was nature painted with translucent colors\".[9]\n\n\nOga's conscientious approach to *My Neighbor Totoro* was a style the *International Herald Tribune* recognized as \"[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive\". The newspaper said of the film:\n\n\n\n\n> Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this sense comes from Oga's evocative backgrounds, which give each tree, hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems ready to spring into sentient life.[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nOga's work on *My Neighbor Totoro* led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli, which assigned him jobs that would play to his strengths, and Oga's style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.[10]\n\n\nOnly one young girl, rather than two sisters, is depicted in several of Miyazaki's initial conceptual watercolor paintings, as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home-video releases. According to Miyazaki; \"If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldn't be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult.\"[6]: 11 Miyazaki said the film's opening sequence was not storyboarded; \"The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets ...\"[6]: 27 The ending sequence depicts the mother's return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.[6]: 149\n\n\nMiyazaki stated that the story was initially intended to be set in 1955, however, the team was not thorough in the research and instead worked on a setting \"in the recent past\".[6]: 33 The film was originally set to be an hour long but during production it grew to respond to the social context, including the reason for the move and the father's occupation.[6]: 54 Eight animators worked on the film, which was completed in eight months.[11]\n\n\nTetsuya Endo noted numerous animation techniques were used in the film. For example, ripples were designed with \"two colors of high-lighting and shading\" and the rain for *My Neighbor Totoro* was \"scratched in the cels\" and superimposed for it to convey a soft feel.[6]: 156 The animators stated one month was taken to create the tadpoles, which included four colors; the water for it was also blurred.[6]: 154\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe music for *My Neighbor Totoro* was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who previously collaborated with Miyazaki on the movies *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* and *Castle in the Sky*. Hisaishi was inspired by the contemporary composers Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and John Cage, and described Miyazaki's films as \"rich and personally compeling\". He hired an orchestra for the soundtrack and primarily used a Fairlight instrument.[6]: 169, 170\n\n\n\nThe soundtrack for *My Neighbor Totoro* was first released in Japan on May 1, 1988, by Tokuma Shoten, and includes the musical score used in the film, except for five vocal pieces that were performed by Azumi Inoue, including \"Stroll\", \"A Lost Child\", and \"My Neighbor Totoro\".[12] It had previously been released as an Image Song CD in 1987 that contains some songs that were not included in the film.[13] \n\n![](image)\n\n\"The Huge Tree in the Tsukamori Forest\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

Miyazaki's production paralleled his colleague Isao Takahata's production of *Grave of the Fireflies*. Miyazaki's film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Grave of the Fireflies* were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered \"one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* initially sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution rental income of ¥588 million in 1988. According to image researcher Seiji Kano, by 2005, the film's box-office gross receipts in Japan totalled ¥1.17 billion[16] ($10.6 million).[17] In France, the film has sold 429,822 tickets since 1999.[18] The film has been internationally released several times since 2002.[19] The film has grossed $30,476,708 worldwide since 2002.[20] A *South China Morning Post* article in 2021 reported that the film has grossed more than $41 million in total.[21]\n\n\nThirty years after its original release in Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* received a Chinese theatrical release in December 2018. The delay was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan but many Chinese people had become familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[22] In its opening weekend, ending December 16, 2018, *My Neighbor Totoro* grossed $13 million, entering the box-office charts at number two behind Hollywood film *Aquaman* and ahead of Bollywood film *Padman* at number three.[23] By its second weekend, *My Neighbor Totoro* had grossed $20 million in China.[24] As of February 2019, it had grossed $25,798,550 in China.[25]\n\n\n\n### English dubs[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, US-based company Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive English language dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* for use as an in-flight movie on Japan Airlines flights.[26] In April 1993, Troma Films, under its label 50th St. Films, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release.[27] The songs for the Streamline version of *My Neighbor Totoro* were sung by Cassie Byram.[28]\n\n\nIn 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a new English dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of *My Neighbor Totoro* has a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retain the translation as the earlier dub but are sung by Sonya Isaacs.[29] The Disney dub was directed by Rick Dempsey, a Disney executive in charge of the company's dubbing services,[30] and was written by Don and Cindy Hewitt, who had written other dubs for Studio Ghibli.[31]\n\n\nDisney's English-language dub premiered on October 23, 2005; it was screened at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival.[30][32] The cable television network Turner Classic Movies (TCM) held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub on January 2006, as part of the network's tribute to Hayao Miyazaki. TCM aired the dub and the original Japanese film with English subtitles.[33] The Disney version was released on DVD in the United States on March 7, 2006.[34] In Australia, an English dub was also released by Madman Entertainment on March 15, 2006.[35]\n\n\nIn 2023, the film was re-released in 970 United States locations as part of celebrations to mark the 35th anniversary of its first theatrical release,[36] with showings in both Japanese with English subtitles and with the English dub.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nTokuma Shoten released *My Neighbor Totoro* on VHS and LaserDisc in August 1988.[39] Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan (now Walt Disney Japan) reissued the VHS on June 27, 1997, as part of their series *Ghibli ga Ippai*.[40] Disney released the film on Blu-ray in Japan on 2012.[41]\n\n\nAfter the rights to the Streamline dub expired in 2004,[42] Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the movie on DVD on March 7, 2006, with Disney's newly produced English dub and the original Japanese version. The company reissued *My Neighbor Totoro*, as well as *Castle in the Sky*, and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, with updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins, on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of *Ponyo*. *My Neighbor Totoro* was re-released by Disney on Blu-Ray on May 21, 2013. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[43]\n\n\nIn Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* had sold 3.5 million VHS and DVD units as of April 2012,[44] equivalent to approximately ¥16,100 million ($202 million) at an average retail price of ¥4,600 (¥4,700 on DVD and ¥4,500 on VHS).[45] In the United States, the film sold over 500,000 VHS units by 1996,[46] with the later 2010 DVD release selling a further 3.8 million units and grossing $64.5 million in the United States as of October 2018.[47]\n\n\nIn the UK, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared on the annual lists of ten-best-selling foreign language films on home video for five consecutive years, ranking number seven in 2015,[48] number six in 2016[49] and 2017,[50] number one in 2018,[51] and number two in 2019 below *Spirited Away*.[52]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* received widespread acclaim from film critics.[53][54] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 59 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"*My Neighbor Totoro* is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood.\"[55] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56]\n\n\nIn 2001, Japanese magazine *Animage* ranked *My Neighbor Totoro* 45th in its list of *100 Best Anime Productions of All Time*.[57] *My Neighbor Totoro* was voted the highest-ranking animated film on *Sight & Sound*'s critics' poll of all-time greatest films, and joint 154th overall.[2] In 2022, the magazine ranked the film as the joint-72nd-greatest film overall, being one of two animated films included in the list.[58][59] *My Neighbor Totoro* was ranked third on the list of \"Greatest Japanese Animated Films of All Time\" by film magazine *Kinema Junpo* in 2009, 41st in *Empire magazine's* \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010, second on a similar *Empire* list of best children's films, and number one in the greatest animated films in *Time Out*; a similar list by the editors ranked the film in third place.[3][60][61][62]\n\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of *Chicago Sun-Times* identified *My Neighbor Totoro* as one of his \"Great Movies\", calling it \"one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki\". In his review, Ebert said the film \"is based on experience, situation and exploration—not on conflict and threat\", and added:\n\n\n> \n> it would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls ... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.[63]\n> \n> \n\n\nSteve Rose from *The Guardian* gave the film five stars, praising Miyazaki's \"rich, bright, hand-drawn\" animation and describing it as \"full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence and joyous discovery, all rooted in a carefully detailed reality\".[64] Trevor Johnston from *Time Out* also awarded the film five stars, commenting on its \"delicate rendering of the atmosphere\" and its first half that \"delicately captures both mystery and quietness\".[65] Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited *My Neighbor Totoro* as one of his favorite films.[66] Writing for the *London Evening Standard*, Charlotte O'Sullivan praised the charm of the film but said it lacks complexity in comparison with *Spirited Away*.[67] Jordan Cronk from *Slant* awarded the film three-and-a-half stars but said it is \"devoid of much of the fantasia of Miyazaki's more outwardly visionary work\".[68] In the 1996 movie guide *\"Seen That, Now What?\"*, *My Neighbor Totoro* was given the rating of \"A\". The guide stated that the film is an \"enchanting, lushly animated view of the natural world with child's sense of wonder\", and noting its suitability for young children while being \"a perennial favorite among [film buffs]\".[69]\n\n\nThe 1993 translation was not as well-received as the 2006 translation; Leonard Klady of *Variety* wrote the 1993 translation demonstrates \"adequate television technical craft\" that is characterized by \"muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a] vapid storyline\". Klady described the film's environment as \"obviously aimed at an international audience\" but \"evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating\".[70] Stephen Holden of *The New York Times* described the 1993 translation as \"very visually handsome\", and said the film is \"very charming\" when \"dispensing enchantment\". Despite the highlights, Holden wrote \"too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat\".[71]\n\n\nMatthew Leyland of *Sight & Sound* reviewed the DVD released in 2006, commenting; \"Miyazaki's family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning to end ... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid credibility of the girls' actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings\". Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film but noted the disc lacks a look at the film's production, instead being overabundant with storyboards.[72] Writing in *Joe Hisaishi's Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro*, Kunio Hara praised the soundtrack, describing the song \"My Neighbor Totoro\" as a \"sonic icon\" of the film. Hara also commented the music \"arouse[s] a similar sentiment of yearning for the past\".[39]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Award\n | Category\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | Kinema Junpo Awards | Kinema Junpo Award – Best Film[73] | Won\n |\n| Readers' Choice Award – Best Japanese Film[74] | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film[73] | Won\n |\n| Ōfuji Noburō Award[75] | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award[73] | Won\n |\n| Animage Anime Awards[76] | Grand Prix prize[73] | Won\n |\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* was considered a milestone for writer-director Hayao Miyazaki. The popularity of film's central character Totoro among Japanese children has been likened to that of Winnie-the-Pooh in Britain.[77] *The Independent* said Totoro is one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing the creature; \"At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki's other magical creations\".[78] The *Financial Times* recognized the character's appeal, commenting Totoro \"is more genuinely loved than Mickey Mouse could hope to be in his wildest—not nearly so beautifully illustrated—fantasies\".[77] *Empire* also commented on Totoro's appeal, ranking him at number 18 on a list of the greatest animated characters of all time.[79]\n\n\nThe character of Totoro later became a mascot and official logo for Studio Ghibli.[80][81][82][83]\n\n\nAccording to the environmental journal *Ambio*, *My Neighbor Totoro* \"has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for *satoyama* and traditional village life\". The film's central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese campaign \"Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign\", which aimed to preserve areas of *satoyama* in Saitama Prefecture.[84] The fund, started in 1990 after the film's release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by *My Neighbor Totoro*.[85]\n\n\nMiyazaki additionally uses Totoro as a part of his logo for Studio Ghibli.[1] Totoro also makes a cameo appearance in the Pixar film *Toy Story 3* (2010)[86] but was not included in *Toy Story 4* due to licensing problems.[87] *Toy Story 3*'s art director Daisuke Tsutsumi is married to Miyazaki's niece, who inspired the character Mei in *My Neighbor Totoro*.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Eoperipatus totoro* – a velvet worm from Vietnam\nA main-belt asteroid that was discovered on December 31, 1994, was named 10160 Totoro.[88] In 2013, *Eoperipatus totoro*, a species of velvet worm that was discovered in Vietnam, was named after Totoro. Following the request of the paper's authors, the species was named for the character because he \"uses a many-legged animal as a vehicle, which according to the collectors resembles a velvet worm\".[89]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan in May 1988, Tokuma published a four-volume series of *ani-manga* books, which use color images and lines directly from *My Neighbor Totoro*.[90][91] The series was licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which released the books from November 10, 2004, through February 15, 2005.[92][93][94][95] A 111-page picture book based on the film and aimed at young children was released by Tokuma on June 28, 1988, and, in a 112-page English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[96][97] Tokuma later released another 176-page art book containing conceptual art from the film and interviews with production staff on July 15, 1988, and, in English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[98][99] In 2013, Viz released a hardcover light novel that was written by Tsugiko Kubo and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki.[100]\n\n\n\n### Sequel[edit]\n\n\n***Mei and the Kittenbus*** (めいとこねこバス, **Mei to Konekobasu**) is a thirteen-minute sequel to *My Neighbor Totoro* that was written and directed by Miyazaki.[101] Chika Sakamoto, who voiced Mei in *Totoro*, returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki voiced Granny Cat (*Neko Baa-chan*) and Totoro. The sequel focuses on the character Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her one-night adventures with Kittenbus, the offspring of Catbus, and other cat-oriented vehicles.[102] The sequel was first released in Japan in 2003 and is regularly shown at Ghibli Museum[103] but has not been released on home video.\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nLicensed *My Neighbor Totoro* merchandise of Totoro has been sold in Japan for decades after the film's release. Sales of the film's licensed merchandise in Japan grossed ¥10.97 billion in 1999, ¥56.08 billion during 2003–2007,[104] at least ¥4.1 billion in 2008,[105] and ¥19.96 billion during 2010–2012.[104]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: My Neighbour Totoro (play)\n\nIn May 2022, the Royal Shakespeare Company and composer Joe Hisaishi announced a stage adaptation of the film titled *My Neighbor Totoro* would run from 8 October 2022 to 21 January 2023 at the Barbican Centre, London.[106] It was adapted by British playwright Tom Morton-Smith and directed by Improbable's Phelim McDermott.[107] Tickets went on sale on 19 May 2022, breaking the theater's box-office record for sales in one day that was previously held by the 2015 production of *Hamlet* starring Benedict Cumberbatch.[108] On 30 March 2023, it was announced that the production will return to the Barbican for another season.[109]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Japan, Our Homeland* and *Mai Mai Miracle* (also depicting Japan in the 1950s)\n* Enchanted forest\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The spirits are called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English-dubbed versions.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"My Neighbor Totoro\". *Toronto International Film Festival*.

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi, and distributed by Toho. The film stars Yuria Nara, Hiroki Doi, Tomoko Yamaguchi, Kazushige Nagashima, Yūki Amami, George Tokoro, Rumi Hiiragi, Akiko Yano, Kazuko Yoshiyuki and Tomoko Naraoka. It is the eighth film Miyazaki directed for Studio Ghibli, and his tenth overall. The film tells the story of Ponyo, a goldfish who escapes from the ocean and is helped by a five-year-old human boy, Sōsuke, after she is washed ashore while trapped in a glass jar. As they bond with each other, Ponyo desires to become a human girl, against the devastating circumstances brought about by her acquisition and use of magic.\n\n\nThe film was originally released in Japan on July 19, 2008 by distributor Toho. It was a major commercial success, grossing over $204 million worldwide and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing anime film of all time. It received critical acclaim for its uplifting themes, visual design, and simultaneous appeal towards young children and all audiences.\n\n\nAn English-language version of the film was released on August 14, 2009 to 927 theatres across the U.S., the widest opening for a Studio Ghibli film in the U.S. It was produced by The Kennedy/Marshall Company and released by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nFujimoto, a once-human wizard, lives underwater with his daughter Brunhilde and her numerous smaller sisters. While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. Sōsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving Sōsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.\n\n\nPonyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name, declaring her desire to be a human named Ponyo. She magically begins changing into a human, a power granted to her by Sōsuke's human blood that she licked. Fujimoto forces her back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, resulting in a tsunami. Ponyo goes back to Sōsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. His mother, Lisa, allows her to stay at their house. Lisa leaves after the tsunami subsides to check up on the residents of the nursing home where she works, promising Sōsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.\n\n\nGran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. Sōsuke's father, Kōichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare declares that if Sōsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and the balance of nature will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried, reminds her that if Sōsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.\n\n\nThe next day, Sōsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo's magic, they make Sōsuke's pop pop boat bigger to traverse the waters, seeing marine life from the Late Devonian period and more people on boats. When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep, and the boat slowly reverts back to its original size. Sōsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. As they continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare. Ponyo and Sōsuke encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy on the imbalance of nature, begs him to return Ponyo to him. Despite their attempt to flee, they are captured, and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.\n\n\nSōsuke reunites with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks him if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human; Sōsuke confirms that he does. She then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees, and she is encased in a bubble given to Sōsuke, who is instructed to kiss it to complete Ponyo's transformation, as the balance of nature is restored. The previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice, having decided he can trust Sōsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses Sōsuke, completing her transformation as a human.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Japanese voice actor[5] | English voice actor[6] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ponyo (ポニョ) | Yuria Nara | Noah Cyrus |\n| Sōsuke (宗介) | Hiroki Doi | Frankie Jonas |\n| Lisa (リサ, *Risa*) | Tomoko Yamaguchi | Tina Fey |\n| Kōichi (耕一) | Kazushige Nagashima | Matt Damon |\n| Gran Mamare (グランマンマーレ, *Guran Manmāre*) | Yūki Amami | Cate Blanchett |\n| Fujimoto (フジモト) | George Tokoro | Liam Neeson |\n| Young Mother (婦人, *Wakai Hahaoya*) | Rumi Hiiragi | Mona Marshall |\n| Young Father (若い父, *Wakai Chichi*) | Shirō Saitō | Bob Bergen |\n| Ponyo's sisters | Akiko Yano |\n| Toki (トキ) | Kazuko Yoshiyuki | Lily Tomlin |\n| Yoshie (ヨシエ) | Tomoko Naraoka | Betty White |\n| Kayo (カヨ) | Tokie Hidari | Cloris Leachman |\n| Kumiko (クミコ) | Emi Hiraoka | Jennessa Rose\n |\n| Karen (カレン) | Nozomi Ōhashi | Colleen O'Shaughnessey |\n| The Newscaster | Shinichi Hatori | Kurt Knutsson\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The setting for *Ponyo* was inspired by the real-life town of Tomonoura in Japan.\nHayao Miyazaki, the film's director and writer, was prompted to create *Ponyo* after producer Toshio Suzuki suggested he make a film aimed at children, noting the success of *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004).[7] The film would be created from a mixture of real-world and fictional influences, combined with a desire to implement new art and animation approaches developed by other Studio Ghibli staff in a feature-length film.[8] In 2004 and 2005, Miyazaki spent time in Tomonoura, a seaside town in Setonaikai National Park, where he familiarised himself with its community and environment. His experience in Tomonoura established the kind of setting he wanted for his next film.[9][10] During his time there, he read the complete works of Natsume Sōseki. He took particular interest in *The Gate*, a book involving a character named Sōsuke who lived at the bottom of a cliff. This provided him more concrete ideas for characters and settings.[11] Initially, Miyazaki solely considered the concept of a film that would depict a stormy sea with \"waves higher than the house on a hillside\". He later created the character Ponyo, a name he thought of as an onomatopoeia of what \"soft, squishy softness\" feels like when touched.[12] Miyazaki recalled that as a nine-year-old he borrowed a copy of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid\" from his neighbour, and that while he was reading it, he had difficulty accepting its premise that its protagonist did not have a soul.[13]\n\n\nWhen preparing pre-production materials, Miyazaki hit a creative block before visiting the Tate Britain art museum, where he found himself startled by an 1852 painting named *Ophelia* done by English painter John Everett Millais and its attention to detail. He remarked, \"I thought, my work is shoddy compared to those artists. I was just astonished. At that point, it became clear to me. Our animation style could not go on as before.\"[14] At the time Katsuya Kondō, Miyazaki's colleague, had been the animation director of *House Hunting* (2006), a 12-minute short film made for screening at the Ghibli Museum. The short used solid and simple lines, and largely used hand-drawn animation. During the production of the short, Kondō had discussed the possibility of producing a feature-length film like this. Kondō accepted an offer to work on the next Studio Ghibli feature film soon after completing the short, identifying an opportunity to progress the ideas behind *House Hunting* with more consideration to story.[15]\n\n\nProduction of *Ponyo* began in May 2006. Kondō was given the role of animation supervisor, and worked closely with Miyazaki in outlining a set of goals that defined the direction of the project, including the use of traditional animation throughout production.[8] Borrowing from Kondō's experience in animating *House Hunting*, *Ponyo* would use solid and simple lines; in isolating basic animation elements, the film would aim to demonstrate the advantages of hand drawn animation through the depiction of motion that cannot be reproduced in any other medium.[8][15] An example of the simple style is when Miyazaki painted a picture of Ponyo riding on a flock of fish, called \"Ponyo is Here\", which was inspired by him listening to *Ride of the Valkyries* while writing a letter to his staff about going with a more elemental style. This would later become a scene in the film.[16] In normal productions, animating a sailing ship would usually involve drawing one cel and sliding it across the frame, which would fix it in a predefined perspective and direction. Miyazaki, however, wanted the ships that appeared in *Ponyo* to be drawn frame-by-frame.[17] A few previous Studio Ghibli films used computer-generated imagery (CGI), the earliest being *Princess Mononoke* (1997).[18] For the production of *Ponyo* however, the computer graphics section at the studio was closed to prioritize hand-drawn animation.[19]\n\n\nSome elements of the film were inspired by Richard Wagner's opera *Die Walküre*.[20] Ponyo's birth name, Brunhilde, is a deliberate reference to the eldest of the nine legendary Valkyrie and Wagner's Brünnhilde. The music also makes reference to Wagner's opera. The character of Sōsuke is based on Miyazaki's son Gorō Miyazaki when he was five.[21]\n\n\nMiyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to *Ponyo*, but producer Toshio Suzuki convinced him to make *The Wind Rises* instead.[22]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nozomi Ōhashi, January 2009, who also voices Karen in the original Japanese version\n*Ponyo*'s eponymous theme song, \"Gake no Ue no Ponyo\", was released ahead of the film on December 5, 2007, performed by Fujioka Fujimaki (a duo consisting of Takaaki Fujioka and Naoya Fujimaki who are known for their underground band *Marichans* from the 1970s) and eight-year-old Nozomi Ōhashi.[23] It entered the top 100 on the Oricon Weekly Charts on July 14, then rose to 24th on July 21, then 6th on July 28, and after the release of the film it ranked 3rd on August 4.[24] By the end of 2008, it was ranked as the 14th highest selling single on the Oricon Yearly Charts. Ōhashi was also the youngest participant in the 59th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, beating Cute's Mai Hagiwara's record at age 11. Afterward, Ōhashi announced her unit with Fujioka Fujimaki was disbanding.[25]\n\n\nAn English-translated pop version of the theme was recorded by Jonas and Cyrus to tie in with the film's English release. The theme plays over the second half of the English version's closing credits; the first half is a translated version of the theme rather than a remix.[26]\n\n\nThe film score of *Ponyo* was composed by Joe Hisaishi, Miyazaki's regular collaborator. The score album, published on compact disc in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications,[27] in South Korea by Pony Canyon Korea[28] and throughout Europe by Germany-based label Colosseum,[29] received a great deal of press in the West, including positive reviews from several veteran film music reviewers.[27][30]\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\n### Japan[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released by Toho on July 19, 2008, in theatres across Japan on 481 screens—a record for a domestic film.[31][32][33][34] As it had beaten *Pokémon: Giratina & the Sky Warrior* (which had opened on the same day). It grossed ¥10 billion ($91 million) in its first month of release,[35] and a total of ¥15.0 billion ($153.1 million) as of November 9, 2008.[36][37]\n\n\nTokyo Anime Fair chose *Ponyo* as Animation of the Year of 2008, as revealed in a press release by Anime News Network.\n\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n![](image)American poster for *Ponyo*\n*Ponyo* was released in the U.S. and Canada on August 14, 2009 by Walt Disney Pictures and The Kennedy/Marshall Company, opening at a wide release at 927 theaters across America, which is by far the widest release for a Studio Ghibli film ever in the U.S, as compared to other Miyazaki films (*Spirited Away* opened in 26 theaters, *Howl's Moving Castle* opened in 36 theaters, and *Princess Mononoke* opened in 38 theaters).[38]\n\n\nThe film's English dub was directed by John Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Peter Sohn of Pixar and produced by Frank Marshall, Hayao Miyazaki, John Lasseter, Steve Alpert, and Kathleen Kennedy; the English script was written by Melissa Mathison.[39][40]\n\n\nIn July 2009, there were multiple pre-screenings of the film in California. Miyazaki traveled to America to promote this film by speaking at the University of California, Berkeley and the San Diego Comic-Con.[41]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2010, as the first film produced by Ghibli or directed by either Miyazaki or Takahata to be released on Blu-ray in America.[42][43] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017 under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.[44]\n\n\nPonyo was released in Southeast Asia on January 1, 2009.[4]\n\n\nThe film was re-released from March 25 to 28, 2018 for its 10th anniversary.[45]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, it made $3,585,852 on 927 screens, which is a per screen average of $3,868.[2] It also opened at number nine at the United States and Canada box office.[2] The film made a total of $15,743,471 in the United States and Canada and $187,461,411 in other countries for a worldwide total of $203,204,882.[2] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as a DVD/Plush Toy pack, on March 2, 2010.\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Ponyo* received critical acclaim.[b] Rotten Tomatoes compiled 174 reviews and determined that 91% were positive, with an average score of 7.6/10. The critics consensus on the website states, \"While not Miyazaki's best film, *Ponyo* is a visually stunning fairy tale that's a sweetly poetic treat for children and Miyazaki fans of all ages.\"[54] On Metacritic, the film has an weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[55]\n\n\n*The Japan Times* gave the film four out of five stars, praised its simple thematic elements and its visual scheme, and compared the film to Miyazaki's classic animation *My Neighbor Totoro*.[56]\n\n\n*Anime Diet* cited the quality of the translation, noting, \"The story and the core of the film was communicated more than adequately through the professional dub and it did not get in the way of the sheer delight and joy that Miyazaki wanted to convey.\" Citing \"slight pacing problems,\" it gave *Ponyo* a rating of 88%.[57]\n\n\nCritics at the Venice International Film Festival generally had high praise.[58][59] Wendy Ide of *The Times* said *Ponyo* \"is as chaotic and exuberant as a story told by a hyperactive toddler,\" and gave it 4 stars out of 5.[60] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film four out of four stars, stating that, \"There is a word to describe *Ponyo*, and that word is magical. This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched. It's wonderful and never even seems to try: It unfolds fantastically.\"[61]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

It stars the voices of Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto and Hitoshi Takagi, and focuses on two young sisters and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.\n\n\nIn 1989, Streamline Pictures produced an English-language dub for exclusive use on transpacific flights of Japan Airlines. Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film. This dub was released in 1993 to United States theaters, and the following year on VHS and LaserDisc in the US by Fox Video in 1994, and on DVD in 2002. The rights to this dub expired in 2004, so Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the film on March 7, 2006 with a new dub cast.[1] This DVD release is the first version of the film in the US to include both Japanese and English language tracks.\n\n\nThe film explores themes such as animism, Shinto symbology, environmentalism and the joys of rural living. *My Neighbor Totoro* received worldwide critical acclaim, and has grossed over $41 million worldwide at the box office as of September 2019; the film also grossed significantly more from home video sales and merchandise.\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* received numerous awards, including the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, the Mainichi Film Award, and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the Blue Ribbon Awards in the same year. The film is considered as one of the top animation films, ranking 41st in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010 and the number-one animated film on the 2012 *Sight & Sound* critics' poll of all-time greatest films.[2][3] The film and its titular character have become cultural icons, and made multiple cameo appearances in other films. Totoro also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called *susuwatari*, that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.[note 1] The *susuwatari* leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book *Three Billy Goats Gruff*. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSatsuki and Mei's house [ja] at the Expo 2005 site\n![](image)\nCloseup view of Satsuki and Mei's house\n\nThe girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\n\n\nThe girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.\n\n\nEventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nAnimism is a major theme in *My Neighbor Totoro*, according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.[4] Totoro has animistic traits and has *kami* status because he lives in a camphor tree in a Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope, and he is referred to as *mori no nushi* (master of the forest).[4] Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a *kami*.[4] According to Phillip E. Wegner, the film is an example of alternative history, citing the utopian-like setting of the anime.[5]\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Japanese voice actor[6]: 175 | English voice actor(Tokuma/Streamline/50th Street Films, 1989/1993)[7] | English voice actor(Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2005)[7] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Satsuki Kusakabe (草壁 サツキ) (10-year-old daughter) | Noriko Hidaka | Lisa Michelson | Dakota Fanning |\n| Mei Kusakabe (草壁 メイ) (4-year-old daughter) | Chika Sakamoto | Cheryl Chase | Elle Fanning |\n| Tatsuo Kusakabe (草壁 タツオ) (father) | Shigesato Itoi | Greg Snegoff | Tim Daly |\n| Yasuko Kusakabe (草壁 靖子) (mother) | Sumi Shimamoto | Alexandra Kenworthy | Lea Salonga |\n| Totoro (トトロ) | Hitoshi Takagi | — | Frank Welker |\n| Kanta Ōgaki (大垣 勘太) (a local boy) | Toshiyuki Amagasa | Kenneth Hartman | Paul Butcher |\n| Granny (祖母) (Nanny in the 1993 dub) | Tanie Kitabayashi | Natalie Core | Pat Carroll |\n| Catbus (ネコバス, **Nekobasu**) | Naoki Tatsuta | Carl Macek (uncredited) | Frank Welker |\n| Michiko (ミチ子) | Chie Kōjiro | Brianne Siddall (uncredited) | Ashley Rose Orr\n |\n| Mrs. Ogaki (Kanta's mother) | Hiroko Maruyama | Melanie MacQueen | Kath Soucie |\n| Mr. Ogaki (Kanta's father) | Masashi Hirose | Steve Kramer | David Midthunder\n |\n| Old Farmer | — | Peter Renaday |\n| Miss Hara (Satsuki's teacher) | Machiko Washio | Edie Mirman (uncredited) | Tress MacNeille (uncredited)\n |\n| Kanta's Aunt | Reiko Suzuki | Russi Taylor |\n| Otoko | Daiki Nakamura | Kerrigan Mahan (uncredited) | Matt Adler |\n| Ryōko | Yūko Mizutani | Lara Cody | Bridget Hoffman |\n| Bus Attendant | — | Kath Soucie |\n| Mailman | Tomomichi Nishimura | Doug Stone (uncredited) | Robert Clotworthy |\n| Moving Man | Shigeru Chiba | Greg Snegoff | Newell Alexander\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nAfter working on *3000 Miles in Search of a Mother*, Miyazaki wanted to make a \"delightful, wonderful film\" that would be set in Japan with the idea to \"entertain and touch its viewers, but stay with them long after they have left the theaters\".[6] Initially, Miyazaki had the main characters Totoro, Mei, Tatsuo, and Kanta.[6]: 8 The director based Mei on his niece,[8] and Totoros as \"serene, carefree creatures\" that were \"supposedly the forest keeper, but that's only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation\".[6]: 5, 103\n\n\nArt director Kazuo Oga was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a *satoyama*. Miyazaki challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with *My Neighbor Totoro* began Oga's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the film's color palette; Oga wanted to paint black soil from Akita Prefecture and Miyazaki preferred the color of red soil from Kantō region.[6]: 82 The finished film was described by Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki; \"It was nature painted with translucent colors\".[9]\n\n\nOga's conscientious approach to *My Neighbor Totoro* was a style the *International Herald Tribune* recognized as \"[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive\". The newspaper said of the film:\n\n\n\n\n> Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this sense comes from Oga's evocative backgrounds, which give each tree, hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems ready to spring into sentient life.[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nOga's work on *My Neighbor Totoro* led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli, which assigned him jobs that would play to his strengths, and Oga's style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.[10]\n\n\nOnly one young girl, rather than two sisters, is depicted in several of Miyazaki's initial conceptual watercolor paintings, as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home-video releases. According to Miyazaki; \"If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldn't be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult.\"[6]: 11 Miyazaki said the film's opening sequence was not storyboarded; \"The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets ...\"[6]: 27 The ending sequence depicts the mother's return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.[6]: 149\n\n\nMiyazaki stated that the story was initially intended to be set in 1955, however, the team was not thorough in the research and instead worked on a setting \"in the recent past\".[6]: 33 The film was originally set to be an hour long but during production it grew to respond to the social context, including the reason for the move and the father's occupation.[6]: 54 Eight animators worked on the film, which was completed in eight months.[11]\n\n\nTetsuya Endo noted numerous animation techniques were used in the film. For example, ripples were designed with \"two colors of high-lighting and shading\" and the rain for *My Neighbor Totoro* was \"scratched in the cels\" and superimposed for it to convey a soft feel.[6]: 156 The animators stated one month was taken to create the tadpoles, which included four colors; the water for it was also blurred.[6]: 154\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe music for *My Neighbor Totoro* was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who previously collaborated with Miyazaki on the movies *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* and *Castle in the Sky*. Hisaishi was inspired by the contemporary composers Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and John Cage, and described Miyazaki's films as \"rich and personally compeling\". He hired an orchestra for the soundtrack and primarily used a Fairlight instrument.[6]: 169, 170\n\n\n\nThe soundtrack for *My Neighbor Totoro* was first released in Japan on May 1, 1988, by Tokuma Shoten, and includes the musical score used in the film, except for five vocal pieces that were performed by Azumi Inoue, including \"Stroll\", \"A Lost Child\", and \"My Neighbor Totoro\".[12] It had previously been released as an Image Song CD in 1987 that contains some songs that were not included in the film.[13] \n\n![](image)\n\n\"The Huge Tree in the Tsukamori Forest\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

Miyazaki's production paralleled his colleague Isao Takahata's production of *Grave of the Fireflies*. Miyazaki's film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Grave of the Fireflies* were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered \"one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* initially sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution rental income of ¥588 million in 1988. According to image researcher Seiji Kano, by 2005, the film's box-office gross receipts in Japan totalled ¥1.17 billion[16] ($10.6 million).[17] In France, the film has sold 429,822 tickets since 1999.[18] The film has been internationally released several times since 2002.[19] The film has grossed $30,476,708 worldwide since 2002.[20] A *South China Morning Post* article in 2021 reported that the film has grossed more than $41 million in total.[21]\n\n\nThirty years after its original release in Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* received a Chinese theatrical release in December 2018. The delay was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan but many Chinese people had become familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[22] In its opening weekend, ending December 16, 2018, *My Neighbor Totoro* grossed $13 million, entering the box-office charts at number two behind Hollywood film *Aquaman* and ahead of Bollywood film *Padman* at number three.[23] By its second weekend, *My Neighbor Totoro* had grossed $20 million in China.[24] As of February 2019, it had grossed $25,798,550 in China.[25]\n\n\n\n### English dubs[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, US-based company Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive English language dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* for use as an in-flight movie on Japan Airlines flights.[26] In April 1993, Troma Films, under its label 50th St. Films, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release.[27] The songs for the Streamline version of *My Neighbor Totoro* were sung by Cassie Byram.[28]\n\n\nIn 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a new English dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of *My Neighbor Totoro* has a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retain the translation as the earlier dub but are sung by Sonya Isaacs.[29] The Disney dub was directed by Rick Dempsey, a Disney executive in charge of the company's dubbing services,[30] and was written by Don and Cindy Hewitt, who had written other dubs for Studio Ghibli.[31]\n\n\nDisney's English-language dub premiered on October 23, 2005; it was screened at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival.[30][32] The cable television network Turner Classic Movies (TCM) held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub on January 2006, as part of the network's tribute to Hayao Miyazaki. TCM aired the dub and the original Japanese film with English subtitles.[33] The Disney version was released on DVD in the United States on March 7, 2006.[34] In Australia, an English dub was also released by Madman Entertainment on March 15, 2006.[35]\n\n\nIn 2023, the film was re-released in 970 United States locations as part of celebrations to mark the 35th anniversary of its first theatrical release,[36] with showings in both Japanese with English subtitles and with the English dub.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nTokuma Shoten released *My Neighbor Totoro* on VHS and LaserDisc in August 1988.[39] Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan (now Walt Disney Japan) reissued the VHS on June 27, 1997, as part of their series *Ghibli ga Ippai*.[40] Disney released the film on Blu-ray in Japan on 2012.[41]\n\n\nAfter the rights to the Streamline dub expired in 2004,[42] Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the movie on DVD on March 7, 2006, with Disney's newly produced English dub and the original Japanese version. The company reissued *My Neighbor Totoro*, as well as *Castle in the Sky*, and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, with updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins, on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of *Ponyo*. *My Neighbor Totoro* was re-released by Disney on Blu-Ray on May 21, 2013. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[43]\n\n\nIn Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* had sold 3.5 million VHS and DVD units as of April 2012,[44] equivalent to approximately ¥16,100 million ($202 million) at an average retail price of ¥4,600 (¥4,700 on DVD and ¥4,500 on VHS).[45] In the United States, the film sold over 500,000 VHS units by 1996,[46] with the later 2010 DVD release selling a further 3.8 million units and grossing $64.5 million in the United States as of October 2018.[47]\n\n\nIn the UK, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared on the annual lists of ten-best-selling foreign language films on home video for five consecutive years, ranking number seven in 2015,[48] number six in 2016[49] and 2017,[50] number one in 2018,[51] and number two in 2019 below *Spirited Away*.[52]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* received widespread acclaim from film critics.[53][54] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 59 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"*My Neighbor Totoro* is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood.\"[55] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56]\n\n\nIn 2001, Japanese magazine *Animage* ranked *My Neighbor Totoro* 45th in its list of *100 Best Anime Productions of All Time*.[57] *My Neighbor Totoro* was voted the highest-ranking animated film on *Sight & Sound*'s critics' poll of all-time greatest films, and joint 154th overall.[2] In 2022, the magazine ranked the film as the joint-72nd-greatest film overall, being one of two animated films included in the list.[58][59] *My Neighbor Totoro* was ranked third on the list of \"Greatest Japanese Animated Films of All Time\" by film magazine *Kinema Junpo* in 2009, 41st in *Empire magazine's* \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010, second on a similar *Empire* list of best children's films, and number one in the greatest animated films in *Time Out*; a similar list by the editors ranked the film in third place.[3][60][61][62]\n\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of *Chicago Sun-Times* identified *My Neighbor Totoro* as one of his \"Great Movies\", calling it \"one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki\". In his review, Ebert said the film \"is based on experience, situation and exploration—not on conflict and threat\", and added:\n\n\n> \n> it would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls ... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.[63]\n> \n> \n\n\nSteve Rose from *The Guardian* gave the film five stars, praising Miyazaki's \"rich, bright, hand-drawn\" animation and describing it as \"full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence and joyous discovery, all rooted in a carefully detailed reality\".[64] Trevor Johnston from *Time Out* also awarded the film five stars, commenting on its \"delicate rendering of the atmosphere\" and its first half that \"delicately captures both mystery and quietness\".[65] Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited *My Neighbor Totoro* as one of his favorite films.[66] Writing for the *London Evening Standard*, Charlotte O'Sullivan praised the charm of the film but said it lacks complexity in comparison with *Spirited Away*.[67] Jordan Cronk from *Slant* awarded the film three-and-a-half stars but said it is \"devoid of much of the fantasia of Miyazaki's more outwardly visionary work\".[68] In the 1996 movie guide *\"Seen That, Now What?\"*, *My Neighbor Totoro* was given the rating of \"A\". The guide stated that the film is an \"enchanting, lushly animated view of the natural world with child's sense of wonder\", and noting its suitability for young children while being \"a perennial favorite among [film buffs]\".[69]\n\n\nThe 1993 translation was not as well-received as the 2006 translation; Leonard Klady of *Variety* wrote the 1993 translation demonstrates \"adequate television technical craft\" that is characterized by \"muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a] vapid storyline\". Klady described the film's environment as \"obviously aimed at an international audience\" but \"evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating\".[70] Stephen Holden of *The New York Times* described the 1993 translation as \"very visually handsome\", and said the film is \"very charming\" when \"dispensing enchantment\". Despite the highlights, Holden wrote \"too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat\".[71]\n\n\nMatthew Leyland of *Sight & Sound* reviewed the DVD released in 2006, commenting; \"Miyazaki's family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning to end ... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid credibility of the girls' actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings\". Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film but noted the disc lacks a look at the film's production, instead being overabundant with storyboards.[72] Writing in *Joe Hisaishi's Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro*, Kunio Hara praised the soundtrack, describing the song \"My Neighbor Totoro\" as a \"sonic icon\" of the film. Hara also commented the music \"arouse[s] a similar sentiment of yearning for the past\".[39]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Award\n | Category\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | Kinema Junpo Awards | Kinema Junpo Award – Best Film[73] | Won\n |\n| Readers' Choice Award – Best Japanese Film[74] | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film[73] | Won\n |\n| Ōfuji Noburō Award[75] | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award[73] | Won\n |\n| Animage Anime Awards[76] | Grand Prix prize[73] | Won\n |\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* was considered a milestone for writer-director Hayao Miyazaki. The popularity of film's central character Totoro among Japanese children has been likened to that of Winnie-the-Pooh in Britain.[77] *The Independent* said Totoro is one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing the creature; \"At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki's other magical creations\".[78] The *Financial Times* recognized the character's appeal, commenting Totoro \"is more genuinely loved than Mickey Mouse could hope to be in his wildest—not nearly so beautifully illustrated—fantasies\".[77] *Empire* also commented on Totoro's appeal, ranking him at number 18 on a list of the greatest animated characters of all time.[79]\n\n\nThe character of Totoro later became a mascot and official logo for Studio Ghibli.[80][81][82][83]\n\n\nAccording to the environmental journal *Ambio*, *My Neighbor Totoro* \"has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for *satoyama* and traditional village life\". The film's central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese campaign \"Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign\", which aimed to preserve areas of *satoyama* in Saitama Prefecture.[84] The fund, started in 1990 after the film's release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by *My Neighbor Totoro*.[85]\n\n\nMiyazaki additionally uses Totoro as a part of his logo for Studio Ghibli.[1] Totoro also makes a cameo appearance in the Pixar film *Toy Story 3* (2010)[86] but was not included in *Toy Story 4* due to licensing problems.[87] *Toy Story 3*'s art director Daisuke Tsutsumi is married to Miyazaki's niece, who inspired the character Mei in *My Neighbor Totoro*.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Eoperipatus totoro* – a velvet worm from Vietnam\nA main-belt asteroid that was discovered on December 31, 1994, was named 10160 Totoro.[88] In 2013, *Eoperipatus totoro*, a species of velvet worm that was discovered in Vietnam, was named after Totoro. Following the request of the paper's authors, the species was named for the character because he \"uses a many-legged animal as a vehicle, which according to the collectors resembles a velvet worm\".[89]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan in May 1988, Tokuma published a four-volume series of *ani-manga* books, which use color images and lines directly from *My Neighbor Totoro*.[90][91] The series was licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which released the books from November 10, 2004, through February 15, 2005.[92][93][94][95] A 111-page picture book based on the film and aimed at young children was released by Tokuma on June 28, 1988, and, in a 112-page English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[96][97] Tokuma later released another 176-page art book containing conceptual art from the film and interviews with production staff on July 15, 1988, and, in English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[98][99] In 2013, Viz released a hardcover light novel that was written by Tsugiko Kubo and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki.[100]\n\n\n\n### Sequel[edit]\n\n\n***Mei and the Kittenbus*** (めいとこねこバス, **Mei to Konekobasu**) is a thirteen-minute sequel to *My Neighbor Totoro* that was written and directed by Miyazaki.[101] Chika Sakamoto, who voiced Mei in *Totoro*, returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki voiced Granny Cat (*Neko Baa-chan*) and Totoro. The sequel focuses on the character Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her one-night adventures with Kittenbus, the offspring of Catbus, and other cat-oriented vehicles.[102] The sequel was first released in Japan in 2003 and is regularly shown at Ghibli Museum[103] but has not been released on home video.\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nLicensed *My Neighbor Totoro* merchandise of Totoro has been sold in Japan for decades after the film's release. Sales of the film's licensed merchandise in Japan grossed ¥10.97 billion in 1999, ¥56.08 billion during 2003–2007,[104] at least ¥4.1 billion in 2008,[105] and ¥19.96 billion during 2010–2012.[104]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: My Neighbour Totoro (play)\n\nIn May 2022, the Royal Shakespeare Company and composer Joe Hisaishi announced a stage adaptation of the film titled *My Neighbor Totoro* would run from 8 October 2022 to 21 January 2023 at the Barbican Centre, London.[106] It was adapted by British playwright Tom Morton-Smith and directed by Improbable's Phelim McDermott.[107] Tickets went on sale on 19 May 2022, breaking the theater's box-office record for sales in one day that was previously held by the 2015 production of *Hamlet* starring Benedict Cumberbatch.[108] On 30 March 2023, it was announced that the production will return to the Barbican for another season.[109]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Japan, Our Homeland* and *Mai Mai Miracle* (also depicting Japan in the 1950s)\n* Enchanted forest\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The spirits are called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English-dubbed versions.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"My Neighbor Totoro\". *Toronto International Film Festival*.

With a budget of US$19 million, production of *Spirited Away* began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nOriginally released in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho, the film received universal acclaim,[12] grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office.[a][13] Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥31.68 billion ($305 million).[14] It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train* in 2020.[15]\n\n\nA co-recipient of the Golden Bear with *Bloody Sunday* at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and the first, and to date only, hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards,[16] *Spirited Away* is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various \"best-of\" lists.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's plot summary **may be too long or excessively detailed.** Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. *(November 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nTen-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Her father stops to explore an abandoned amusement park despite Chihiro's protests. They find a restaurant stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents begin to eat. While exploring alone, Chihiro finds a bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to leave. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have become pigs, and the exit is blocked by an ocean of water.\n\n\nHaku finds Chihiro and leads her toward the bathhouse. She sees several animals and creatures visiting the bathhouse, as well as No-Face (顔無し, *Kaonashi*), a masked spirit. Haku instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji says that he already has enough susuwatari to help him. After Chihiro tries to help but inadvertently causes some disruption, Kamaji asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse.\n\n\nYubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but Chihiro persists. Eventually, Yubaba reveals she took an oath to give work to anyone who asks for it, and gives Chihiro a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name (千尋), renaming her Sen (千). Haku reveals he is also working for Yubaba.\n\n\nThe bathhouse workers dislike Sen, but give her work as Lin's assistant. Later that night, when Yubaba leaves, Haku finds Sen and shows her her parents, who are being held in pigpens. Haku explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world. Sen is ostracized by the other workers. While working, she invites No-Face inside, accidentally believing him to be a customer.\n\n\nThe spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's first customer. Sen discovers a bicycle handle sticking out of him, and the workers help to remove the bicycle and a large amount of garbage. He gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it before swallowing him. He demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers. Meanwhile, Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When he crashes into Yubaba's penthouse with grievous injuries, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami stows away on her back.\n\n\nNo-Face is given large amounts of food, but soon begins eating more workers. In the penthouse, the stowaway shikigami shapeshifts into Yubaba's sister, Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse. Sen, Haku, and Boh fall into the boiler room. Sen feeds Haku part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up a seal he stole, saving him from its deadly curse. Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba, taking Boh with her. She confronts an engorged No-Face, who reveals he is very lonely. Sen feeds No-Face the rest of the dumpling, and he follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Lin takes Sen to the station to see Zeniba, and Sen invites No-Face to follow, despite Lin's protests. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel with train tickets given to Sen by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing.\n\n\nHaku offers to retrieve Boh if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test. Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband. Haku appears in dragon form, and Sen, Boh, and Haku leave for the bathhouse, leaving No-Face with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen discovers Haku's identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, *Nigihayami Kohakunushi*). When they arrive, Sen passes Yubaba's test to identify her parents, and she is allowed to leave. Haku vows to see her again, but she leaves the city with her parents, who do not remember anything after the restaurant. After returning to their own world, the family find their car covered with leaves and dust, as the forest around it has become immensely overgrown. They then exit the forest and continue their journey to their new home.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Voice actor\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese (Nihongo)\n | Japanese\n | English\n |\n| Chihiro Ogino / Sen\n | *Ogino Chihiro* (荻野 千尋) / *Sen* (千)[b] | Rumi Hiiragi | Daveigh Chase |\n| Haku / Spirit of the Kohaku River\n | *Haku* (ハク) / *Nigihayami Kohakunushi* (饒速水小白主)[c] | Miyu Irino | Jason Marsden |\n| Yubaba\n | *Yubāba* (湯婆婆)[d] | Mari Natsuki | Suzanne Pleshette |\n| Zeniba\n | *Zeniiba* (銭婆)[e] |\n| Kamaji\n | *Kamajii* (釜爺)[f] | Bunta Sugawara | David Ogden Stiers |\n| Lin\n | *Rin* (リン) | Yoomi Tamai | Susan Egan |\n| Chichiyaku\n | *Chichiyaku* (父役)\n | Tsunehiko Kamijō | Paul Eiding |\n| Aniyaku (assistant Manager)\n | Aniyaku (兄役)\n | Takehiko Ono | John Ratzenberger |\n| No-Face[g] | *Kaonashi* (顔無し)[g] | Akio Nakamura | Bob Bergen |\n| Aogaeru\n | *Aogaeru* (青蛙)[h] | Tatsuya Gashūin |\n| Bandai-gaeru (foreman)\n | *Bandai-gaeru* (番台蛙)[i] | Yō Ōizumi | Rodger Bumpass |\n| Boh (baby)\n | *Bō* (坊)\n | Ryunosuke Kamiki | Tara Strong |\n| Akio Ogino (Chihiro's father)\n | *Ogino Akio* (荻野 明夫)\n | Takashi Naitō | Michael Chiklis |\n| Yūko Ogino (Chihiro's mother)\n | *Ogino Yūko* (荻野 悠子)\n | Yasuko Sawaguchi | Lauren Holly |\n| River Spirit\n | *Kawa no Kami* (河の神)\n | Koba Hayashi | Jim Ward |\n| Radish Spirit\n | *Oshira-sama* (お白様)[j] | Ken Yasuda | Jack Angel |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...]. [I]t's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances [...]. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Hayao Miyazaki[17]\n\nEvery summer, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for *Spirited Away* came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like *Nakayoshi* and *Ribon* the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they \"held dear in their hearts\" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.[17]\n\n\n\n![Close up photograph of Hayao Miyazaki, smiling and wearing a suit and tie in front of a gold-colored mosaic.](image)Hayao Miyazaki used shōjo manga magazines for inspiration to direct *Spirited Away*.\nMiyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals—one based on the Japanese book *Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi* (霧のむこうのふしぎな町) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine—were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming *Spirited Away*, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of *Spirited Away*.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese dragon ascends toward the heavens with Mount Fuji in the background in this print from Ogata Gekkō. *Spirited Away* is heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore.[8]\nProduction of *Spirited Away* commenced in February 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million).[2] Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film's production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution.[18][19] As with *Princess Mononoke*, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a \"pretty girl\". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked \"dull\" and thought, \"She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?\" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel \"she will be a charming woman.\"[17]\n\n\n\n![A medium shot photograph of a hot spring in the city of Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku, Japan.](image)Dōgo Onsen\n![A wide photograph of a hallway from the Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum, which was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.](image)The Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.Miyazaki based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the buildings in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes.\"[17] Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (能登谷旅館), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.[20] While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.[21] The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the *Spirited Away* onsen/bathhouse.[22]\n\n\nToshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of *Spirited Away*. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki's own influences by European films such as *The Snow Queen* and *The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep*.[23]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Spirited Away*\n\nThe film score of *Spirited Away* was composed and conducted by Miyazaki's regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic.[24] The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.[25][26][27] Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to \"One Summer's Day\" and named the new version of the song \"The Name of Life\" (いのちの名前, *\"Inochi no Namae\"*) which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.[28]\n\n\nThe closing song, \"Always With Me\" (いつも何度でも, *\"Itsumo Nando Demo\"*, lit. 'Always, No Matter How Many Times') was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka.[29] The lyrics were written by Kimura's friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for *Rin the Chimney Painter* (煙突描きのリン, *Entotsu-kaki no Rin*), a different Miyazaki film which was never released.[29] In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create *Spirited Away*.[29] The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.[30]\n\n\nBesides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled *Spirited Away Image Album* (千と千尋の神隠し　イメージアルバム, *Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Imēji Arubamu*), that contains 10 tracks.[31]\n\n\n\n### English dub[edit]\n\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing *Spirited Away* Lasseter was ecstatic.[32] Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing *Spirited Away* to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: *Beauty and the Beast* co-director Kirk Wise and *Aladdin* co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of *Spirited Away*, respectively.[32] Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nThe cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with *Spirited Away* being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of *Disney.com*; Disney had sidelined their official website for *Spirited Away*[32] and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.[19] Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Supernaturalism[edit]\n\n\nThe major themes of *Spirited Away*, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.[8] Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:\n\n\n> In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.[8]\n> \n> \n\nChihiro's archetypal entrance into another world demarcates her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word *kamikakushi* (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'\"[33]\n\n\nAdditional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Fantasy[edit]\n\n\nThe film has been compared to Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass*, as the stories have some elements in common such as being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.[35][36][37] Among other stories compared to *Spirited Away*, *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* is seen to be more closely linked thematically.[36]\n\n\nYubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film *Pinocchio*, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child,[38] who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.[38]\n\n\n\n### Traditional Japanese culture[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.[39] Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the *shōjo*, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.[39] Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.[38] In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.[40]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy plays a huge role in *Spirited Away*, specifically through concepts like *Kami* and principles like *Mottainai* and *On*.[41] The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro's character development.\n\n\n\n### Western consumerism[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to the Japanese concept of *On*, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture.[42] For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees' quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of *chi*, the first character in Chihiro's name, lit. 'one thousand') can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value.[39]\n\n\n\nMiyazaki's film setting encapsulates his commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan's distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film's visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis – the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has \"credit cards and cash\", before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits.[43] Miyazaki has stated:\n\n\n> Chihiro's parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that \"turned into pigs\" during Japan's bubble economy (consumer society) of the 1980s, and these people still haven't realized they've become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don't return to being human but instead gradually start to have the \"body and soul of a pig\". These people are the ones saying, \"We are in a recession and don't have enough to eat.\" This doesn't just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) \"a trap to catch lost humans\".[42]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.[44] Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;[39] it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face.[45] In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.[39]\n\n\n\n### Environmentalism[edit]\n\n\nCommentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In *Spirited Away*, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.[46]\n\n\nThe second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.[47][48]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Box office and theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record ¥1.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by *Princess Mononoke*.[49] It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total.[50] After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001.[51] It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States.[52][53] It went on to gross ¥30.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan.[54] It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by *Titanic*.[55] Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to ¥31.68 billion, as of 2020[update].[56][57]\n\n\nIn February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France.[58] The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.[59]\n\n\nDisney's English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002[60] and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. *Spirited Away* had very little marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002.[19] After the 2003 Oscars,[61] it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003.[62] Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively.[63] In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.[64]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003.[65] The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003.[66][67] The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.[68]\n\n\nAbout 18 years after its original release in Japan, *Spirited Away* had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It follows the theatrical China release of *My Neighbour Totoro* in December 2018.[69] The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[70] It topped the Chinese box office with a $28.8-million opening weekend, beating *Toy Story 4* in China.[71] In its second weekend, *Spirited Away* grossed a cumulative $54.8 million in China, and was second only behind *Spider-Man: Far From Home* that weekend.[72] As of 16 July 2019[update], the film has grossed $70 million in China,[73] bringing its worldwide total box office to over $346 million as of 8 July 2019[update].[74]\n\n\n*Spirited Away*'s worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.[a]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was first released on VHS and DVD formats in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002.[75] The Japanese DVD releases include storyboards for the film and the special edition includes a Ghibli DVD player.[76] *Spirited Away* sold 5.5 million home video units in Japan by 2007,[77] and holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in the country as of 2014[update].[78] The movie was released on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Japan on 14 July 2014, and DVD was also reissued on the same day with a new HD master, alongside several other Studio Ghibli movies.[79][80]\n\n\nIn North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003.[81] The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller.[82] The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and *The Art of Spirited Away*, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden.[83] The movie was released on Blu-ray by and North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 16 June 2015.[84] GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017 following the expiration of Disney's previous deal with Studio Ghibli in the country in North America.[85] On 12 November 2019, GKIDS and Shout! Factory issued a North-America-exclusive *Spirited Away* collector's edition, which includes the film on Blu-ray, and the film's soundtrack on CD, as well as a 40-page book with statements by Toshio Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki, and essays by film critic Kenneth Turan and film historian Leonard Maltin.[86][87] Along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli films, *Spirited Away* was released on digital markets in the United States for the first time, on 17 December 2019.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and VHS as a rental release through independent distributor High Fliers Films PLC following the film's limited theatrical release. It was later officially released on DVD in the UK on 29 March 2004, with the distribution being done by Optimum Releasing themselves.[88] In 2006, the DVD was reissued as a single-disc release (without the second one) with packaging matching other releases in Optimum's \"The Studio Ghibli Collection\" range.[89] The then-renamed StudioCanal UK released the movie on Blu-ray on 24 November 2014, A British 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition, similar to other Studio Ghibli anniversary editions released in the UK, was released on 25 October 2021.[90]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2015 Blu-ray release grossed $9,925,660 from 557,613 physical units sold as of 21 February 2021[update].[91] In the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015,[92] number five in 2016,[93] and number one in 2019.[94]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on 24 January 2003.

Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*, and wrote that Miyazaki's \"movies are as much about moodiness as mood\" and that \"the prospect of animated figures' not being what they seem – either spiritually or physically – heightens the tension.\"[37] Derek Elley of *Variety* said that *Spirited Away* \"can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike\" and praised the animation and music.[100] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* praised Miyazaki's direction and the voice acting, as well as saying that the film is the \"product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before.\"[101] *Orlando Sentinel*'s critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki's direction and said the film is \"the perfect choice for a child who has moved into a new home.\"[102]\n\n\nIn 2004, *Cinefantastique* listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".[103] In 2005, *Spirited Away* was ranked by IGN as the 12th-best animated film of all time.[104] The film is also ranked number 9 of the highest-rated movies of all time on Metacritic, being the highest rated traditionally animated film on the site. The film ranked number 10 in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[105] In 2010, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it as the 13th-best animated film on the site,[106] and in 2012, as the 17th.[107] In 2019, the site considered the film to be #1 among 140 essential animated movies to watch.[108] The film was ranked at number 46 on *Time Out* magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\".[109] The film is listed within the top ten on the British Film Institute's list of \"Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14\".[110] In 2016, it was voted the fourth-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, making it the highest-ranking animated film on the list.[111] In 2017, *The New York Times* ranked it as the second best film of the 21st Century so far.[112] In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked *Spirited Away'*s screenplay the 67th greatest of the 21st century so far.[113] In 2022, the film was ranked number 75 on *Sight & Sound*'s greatest films list, being one of two animated films to make the list (alongside Miyazaki's own *My Neighbor Totoro*).[114][115]\n\n\nIn his book *Otaku*, Hiroki Azuma observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan,\" and cites Miyazaki's win at the Academy Awards for *Spirited Away* among his examples.[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | Animation Kobe | Theatrical Film Award | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 5th Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki | Won\n |\n| 2002\n | 25th Japan Academy Award | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won[117] |\n| Best Song\n | Youmi Kimura | Won[117] |\n| 52nd Berlin International Film Festival | Golden Bear | *Spirited Away* | Won[k][118] |\n| Cinekid Festival | Cinekid Film Award\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[l][119] |\n| 21st Hong Kong Film Awards | Best Asian Film\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[120] |\n| Tokyo Anime Award | Animation of the Year\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Art Direction\n | Yôji Takeshige [ja] | Won\n |\n| Best Character Design\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Director\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Music\n | Joe Hisaishi | Won\n |\n| Best Screenplay\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Voice Actor\n | Rumi Hiiragi as Chihiro\n | Won\n |\n| Notable Entry\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| National Board of Review | National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| New York Film Critics Online | Best Animated Feature\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 2003\n | 75th Academy Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won[121] |\n| 30th Annie Awards | Annie Award for Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Directing in an Animated Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Writing in a Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production | Joe Hisaishi\n | Won\n |\n| 8th Critics' Choice Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 29th Saturn Awards | Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Saturn Award for Best Writing | Hayao MiyazakiCindy Davis Hewitt (English adaptation)Donald H.

In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki's wide impact to the film industry, he wrote \"The influence of *Spirited Away* can be easily observed in Disney productions like *Brave* and *Frozen*, thanks to John Lasseter's (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences\".[126][127] *Vice* also declared *Spirited Away* to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film \"showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be\" that \"Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later\".[128]\n\n\nFilm director Steven Spielberg said that *Spirited Away* might be \"better than any Disney films\" he has ever seen.[129] Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told *Time* that \"This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time\".[130] The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at *Spirited Away* and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in *Coco*.[131] Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore \"ideas of morality and humanity\" in *Eternals*.[132] *Turning Red*'s director Domee Shi named *Spirited Away* as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Commercial and cultural significance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Time*, *Spirited Away* \"arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works\" but it \"shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world\". Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney \"boosted *Spirited Away*'s visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards\", and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[134] Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film's Oscar win was \"a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years\".[135] Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called *Spirited Away*'s wins at major Western award shows \"a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry\". She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as \"childish, vulgar, things that you didn't take seriously\" but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as \"a real art form\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nA stage adaptation of *Spirited Away* was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli's blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi.[137][138] In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024.[139]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Main Cast\n |\n| --- |\n| Character name\n | Actor (Double Cast)\n |\n| *Chihiro* (千尋)\n | Kanna Hashimoto | Mone Kamishiraishi |\n| *Haku* (ハク)\n | Kotarou Daigo\n | Hiroki Miura |\n| *Kaonashi* (顔無し)\n | Koharu Sugawara | Tomohiko Tsujimoto\n |\n| *Rin* (リン)\n | Miyu Sakihi\n | Fuu Hinami\n |\n| *Kamajī* (釜爺)\n | Tomorowo Taguchi | Satoshi Hashimoto |\n| *Yubāba* (湯婆婆) / *Zenība* (銭婆)\n | Mari Natsuki | Romi Park |\n\n\n### Limited time re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn a limited time release from 11 November to 18 December in 2022,[140][141] the Imperial Theater performance of the play was available for rental in Japan in several streaming services such as Abema, Amazon Prime Video Japan, Docomo Anime Store, FOD, Hulu Japan and U-Next.[142]\n\n\nThere were 2 versions of the play available for rental:\n\n\n\n* **Stage \"Spirited Away\" (Chihiro role: Kanna Hashimoto) ≪Imperial Theater performance version≫ (First distribution)**.

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi, and distributed by Toho. The film stars Yuria Nara, Hiroki Doi, Tomoko Yamaguchi, Kazushige Nagashima, Yūki Amami, George Tokoro, Rumi Hiiragi, Akiko Yano, Kazuko Yoshiyuki and Tomoko Naraoka. It is the eighth film Miyazaki directed for Studio Ghibli, and his tenth overall. The film tells the story of Ponyo, a goldfish who escapes from the ocean and is helped by a five-year-old human boy, Sōsuke, after she is washed ashore while trapped in a glass jar. As they bond with each other, Ponyo desires to become a human girl, against the devastating circumstances brought about by her acquisition and use of magic.\n\n\nThe film was originally released in Japan on July 19, 2008 by distributor Toho. It was a major commercial success, grossing over $204 million worldwide and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing anime film of all time. It received critical acclaim for its uplifting themes, visual design, and simultaneous appeal towards young children and all audiences.\n\n\nAn English-language version of the film was released on August 14, 2009 to 927 theatres across the U.S., the widest opening for a Studio Ghibli film in the U.S. It was produced by The Kennedy/Marshall Company and released by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nFujimoto, a once-human wizard, lives underwater with his daughter Brunhilde and her numerous smaller sisters. While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. Sōsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving Sōsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.\n\n\nPonyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name, declaring her desire to be a human named Ponyo. She magically begins changing into a human, a power granted to her by Sōsuke's human blood that she licked. Fujimoto forces her back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, resulting in a tsunami. Ponyo goes back to Sōsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. His mother, Lisa, allows her to stay at their house. Lisa leaves after the tsunami subsides to check up on the residents of the nursing home where she works, promising Sōsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.\n\n\nGran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. Sōsuke's father, Kōichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare declares that if Sōsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and the balance of nature will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried, reminds her that if Sōsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.\n\n\nThe next day, Sōsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo's magic, they make Sōsuke's pop pop boat bigger to traverse the waters, seeing marine life from the Late Devonian period and more people on boats. When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep, and the boat slowly reverts back to its original size. Sōsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. As they continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare. Ponyo and Sōsuke encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy on the imbalance of nature, begs him to return Ponyo to him. Despite their attempt to flee, they are captured, and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.\n\n\nSōsuke reunites with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks him if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human; Sōsuke confirms that he does. She then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees, and she is encased in a bubble given to Sōsuke, who is instructed to kiss it to complete Ponyo's transformation, as the balance of nature is restored. The previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice, having decided he can trust Sōsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses Sōsuke, completing her transformation as a human.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Japanese voice actor[5] | English voice actor[6] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ponyo (ポニョ) | Yuria Nara | Noah Cyrus |\n| Sōsuke (宗介) | Hiroki Doi | Frankie Jonas |\n| Lisa (リサ, *Risa*) | Tomoko Yamaguchi | Tina Fey |\n| Kōichi (耕一) | Kazushige Nagashima | Matt Damon |\n| Gran Mamare (グランマンマーレ, *Guran Manmāre*) | Yūki Amami | Cate Blanchett |\n| Fujimoto (フジモト) | George Tokoro | Liam Neeson |\n| Young Mother (婦人, *Wakai Hahaoya*) | Rumi Hiiragi | Mona Marshall |\n| Young Father (若い父, *Wakai Chichi*) | Shirō Saitō | Bob Bergen |\n| Ponyo's sisters | Akiko Yano |\n| Toki (トキ) | Kazuko Yoshiyuki | Lily Tomlin |\n| Yoshie (ヨシエ) | Tomoko Naraoka | Betty White |\n| Kayo (カヨ) | Tokie Hidari | Cloris Leachman |\n| Kumiko (クミコ) | Emi Hiraoka | Jennessa Rose\n |\n| Karen (カレン) | Nozomi Ōhashi | Colleen O'Shaughnessey |\n| The Newscaster | Shinichi Hatori | Kurt Knutsson\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The setting for *Ponyo* was inspired by the real-life town of Tomonoura in Japan.\nHayao Miyazaki, the film's director and writer, was prompted to create *Ponyo* after producer Toshio Suzuki suggested he make a film aimed at children, noting the success of *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004).[7] The film would be created from a mixture of real-world and fictional influences, combined with a desire to implement new art and animation approaches developed by other Studio Ghibli staff in a feature-length film.[8] In 2004 and 2005, Miyazaki spent time in Tomonoura, a seaside town in Setonaikai National Park, where he familiarised himself with its community and environment. His experience in Tomonoura established the kind of setting he wanted for his next film.[9][10] During his time there, he read the complete works of Natsume Sōseki. He took particular interest in *The Gate*, a book involving a character named Sōsuke who lived at the bottom of a cliff. This provided him more concrete ideas for characters and settings.[11] Initially, Miyazaki solely considered the concept of a film that would depict a stormy sea with \"waves higher than the house on a hillside\". He later created the character Ponyo, a name he thought of as an onomatopoeia of what \"soft, squishy softness\" feels like when touched.[12] Miyazaki recalled that as a nine-year-old he borrowed a copy of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid\" from his neighbour, and that while he was reading it, he had difficulty accepting its premise that its protagonist did not have a soul.[13]\n\n\nWhen preparing pre-production materials, Miyazaki hit a creative block before visiting the Tate Britain art museum, where he found himself startled by an 1852 painting named *Ophelia* done by English painter John Everett Millais and its attention to detail. He remarked, \"I thought, my work is shoddy compared to those artists. I was just astonished. At that point, it became clear to me. Our animation style could not go on as before.\"[14] At the time Katsuya Kondō, Miyazaki's colleague, had been the animation director of *House Hunting* (2006), a 12-minute short film made for screening at the Ghibli Museum. The short used solid and simple lines, and largely used hand-drawn animation. During the production of the short, Kondō had discussed the possibility of producing a feature-length film like this. Kondō accepted an offer to work on the next Studio Ghibli feature film soon after completing the short, identifying an opportunity to progress the ideas behind *House Hunting* with more consideration to story.[15]\n\n\nProduction of *Ponyo* began in May 2006. Kondō was given the role of animation supervisor, and worked closely with Miyazaki in outlining a set of goals that defined the direction of the project, including the use of traditional animation throughout production.[8] Borrowing from Kondō's experience in animating *House Hunting*, *Ponyo* would use solid and simple lines; in isolating basic animation elements, the film would aim to demonstrate the advantages of hand drawn animation through the depiction of motion that cannot be reproduced in any other medium.[8][15] An example of the simple style is when Miyazaki painted a picture of Ponyo riding on a flock of fish, called \"Ponyo is Here\", which was inspired by him listening to *Ride of the Valkyries* while writing a letter to his staff about going with a more elemental style. This would later become a scene in the film.[16] In normal productions, animating a sailing ship would usually involve drawing one cel and sliding it across the frame, which would fix it in a predefined perspective and direction. Miyazaki, however, wanted the ships that appeared in *Ponyo* to be drawn frame-by-frame.[17] A few previous Studio Ghibli films used computer-generated imagery (CGI), the earliest being *Princess Mononoke* (1997).[18] For the production of *Ponyo* however, the computer graphics section at the studio was closed to prioritize hand-drawn animation.[19]\n\n\nSome elements of the film were inspired by Richard Wagner's opera *Die Walküre*.[20] Ponyo's birth name, Brunhilde, is a deliberate reference to the eldest of the nine legendary Valkyrie and Wagner's Brünnhilde. The music also makes reference to Wagner's opera. The character of Sōsuke is based on Miyazaki's son Gorō Miyazaki when he was five.[21]\n\n\nMiyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to *Ponyo*, but producer Toshio Suzuki convinced him to make *The Wind Rises* instead.[22]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nozomi Ōhashi, January 2009, who also voices Karen in the original Japanese version\n*Ponyo*'s eponymous theme song, \"Gake no Ue no Ponyo\", was released ahead of the film on December 5, 2007, performed by Fujioka Fujimaki (a duo consisting of Takaaki Fujioka and Naoya Fujimaki who are known for their underground band *Marichans* from the 1970s) and eight-year-old Nozomi Ōhashi.[23] It entered the top 100 on the Oricon Weekly Charts on July 14, then rose to 24th on July 21, then 6th on July 28, and after the release of the film it ranked 3rd on August 4.[24] By the end of 2008, it was ranked as the 14th highest selling single on the Oricon Yearly Charts. Ōhashi was also the youngest participant in the 59th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, beating Cute's Mai Hagiwara's record at age 11. Afterward, Ōhashi announced her unit with Fujioka Fujimaki was disbanding.[25]\n\n\nAn English-translated pop version of the theme was recorded by Jonas and Cyrus to tie in with the film's English release. The theme plays over the second half of the English version's closing credits; the first half is a translated version of the theme rather than a remix.[26]\n\n\nThe film score of *Ponyo* was composed by Joe Hisaishi, Miyazaki's regular collaborator. The score album, published on compact disc in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications,[27] in South Korea by Pony Canyon Korea[28] and throughout Europe by Germany-based label Colosseum,[29] received a great deal of press in the West, including positive reviews from several veteran film music reviewers.[27][30]\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\n### Japan[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released by Toho on July 19, 2008, in theatres across Japan on 481 screens—a record for a domestic film.[31][32][33][34] As it had beaten *Pokémon: Giratina & the Sky Warrior* (which had opened on the same day). It grossed ¥10 billion ($91 million) in its first month of release,[35] and a total of ¥15.0 billion ($153.1 million) as of November 9, 2008.[36][37]\n\n\nTokyo Anime Fair chose *Ponyo* as Animation of the Year of 2008, as revealed in a press release by Anime News Network.\n\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n![](image)American poster for *Ponyo*\n*Ponyo* was released in the U.S. and Canada on August 14, 2009 by Walt Disney Pictures and The Kennedy/Marshall Company, opening at a wide release at 927 theaters across America, which is by far the widest release for a Studio Ghibli film ever in the U.S, as compared to other Miyazaki films (*Spirited Away* opened in 26 theaters, *Howl's Moving Castle* opened in 36 theaters, and *Princess Mononoke* opened in 38 theaters).[38]\n\n\nThe film's English dub was directed by John Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Peter Sohn of Pixar and produced by Frank Marshall, Hayao Miyazaki, John Lasseter, Steve Alpert, and Kathleen Kennedy; the English script was written by Melissa Mathison.[39][40]\n\n\nIn July 2009, there were multiple pre-screenings of the film in California. Miyazaki traveled to America to promote this film by speaking at the University of California, Berkeley and the San Diego Comic-Con.[41]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2010, as the first film produced by Ghibli or directed by either Miyazaki or Takahata to be released on Blu-ray in America.[42][43] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017 under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.[44]\n\n\nPonyo was released in Southeast Asia on January 1, 2009.[4]\n\n\nThe film was re-released from March 25 to 28, 2018 for its 10th anniversary.[45]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, it made $3,585,852 on 927 screens, which is a per screen average of $3,868.[2] It also opened at number nine at the United States and Canada box office.[2] The film made a total of $15,743,471 in the United States and Canada and $187,461,411 in other countries for a worldwide total of $203,204,882.[2] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as a DVD/Plush Toy pack, on March 2, 2010.\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Ponyo* received critical acclaim.[b] Rotten Tomatoes compiled 174 reviews and determined that 91% were positive, with an average score of 7.6/10. The critics consensus on the website states, \"While not Miyazaki's best film, *Ponyo* is a visually stunning fairy tale that's a sweetly poetic treat for children and Miyazaki fans of all ages.\"[54] On Metacritic, the film has an weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[55]\n\n\n*The Japan Times* gave the film four out of five stars, praised its simple thematic elements and its visual scheme, and compared the film to Miyazaki's classic animation *My Neighbor Totoro*.[56]\n\n\n*Anime Diet* cited the quality of the translation, noting, \"The story and the core of the film was communicated more than adequately through the professional dub and it did not get in the way of the sheer delight and joy that Miyazaki wanted to convey.\" Citing \"slight pacing problems,\" it gave *Ponyo* a rating of 88%.[57]\n\n\nCritics at the Venice International Film Festival generally had high praise.[58][59] Wendy Ide of *The Times* said *Ponyo* \"is as chaotic and exuberant as a story told by a hyperactive toddler,\" and gave it 4 stars out of 5.[60] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film four out of four stars, stating that, \"There is a word to describe *Ponyo*, and that word is magical. This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched. It's wonderful and never even seems to try: It unfolds fantastically.\"[61]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD) and includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (*kami*) of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. The term *mononoke* (物の怪, or もののけ) is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.\n\n\nThe film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, by Toho, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. This was the first Studio Ghibli film in the United States to be rated PG-13 by the MPA. It was a critical and commercial blockbuster, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's *Spirited Away*, another Miyazaki film. It was dubbed into English with a script by Neil Gaiman and initially distributed in North America by Miramax, where it sold well on home media despite not performing strongly at the box office.[2] The film greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curse him before its death. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes him pain and will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\n\n\nHeading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant Night Walker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gun shot. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then manages to rescue two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the Great Forest Spirit.\n\n\nAshitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for outcasts and lepers employed to process iron and create firearms, such as hand cannons and matchlock muskets. Ashitaka learns that the town was built by clearcutting forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano, a local daimyō, and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into the demon that attacked Ashitaka's village. She also reveals that San, dubbed Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves and hates humankind.\n\n\nSan infiltrates Iron Town to kill Eboshi. Ashitaka intervenes and subdues Eboshi and San while they are in combat. Amidst the hysteria he is shot by a villager, but the curse gives him strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo. Eboshi intends to give the god's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality) in return for protection from Lord Asano, while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.\n\n\nAshitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano's samurai. The boar clan has been annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo's men trick Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka saves San while the Forest Spirit euthanizes Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Night Walker Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while the Forest Spirit's body bleeds ooze that spreads over the land and kills anything it touches. The forest and its spirits begin to die. Moro's head briefly comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives. Enraged, San attempts to kill Eboshi, but is stopped by Ashitaka, who consoles her and encourages her not to give up.\n\n\nAfter Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing it and lifting Ashitaka's curse. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi vows to build a better town and the forest begins to regrow.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Novelist Ali Shaw has described Yakul as being more similar to a red Lechwe than an elk. Miyazaki called Ashitaka a \"melancholic boy who has a fate\" and stated that Ashitaka's curse \"is similar to the lives of people [at the time]\".[5] Ashitaka's English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as \"an unexpected hero. He's not your usual wild, brave guy. He's really just a young, earnest man who's trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village.\"\n* Yuriko Ishida voices San (サン), a young woman who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans, but eventually comes to care for Ashitaka. In the English version, San is voiced by Claire Danes.\n\t+ Ishida also voices Kaya (カヤ), Ashitaka's bride-elect who breaks the rules of the village to gift him her dagger to remember her by.[6] Tara Strong provides her voice in the English version, where she is referred to as his younger sister due to the translation.\n* Yūko Tanaka provides the voice of Lady Eboshi (エボシ御前, *Eboshi Gozen*), the ruler of Irontown who continually clears the forest. Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film.[5] Miyazaki said that Eboshi has a strong and secure personality, evident in the fact that she let Ashitaka move freely through the settlement unescorted, despite his unclear motives. He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperor's authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she would not hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams. Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a shirabyōshi.[7] Eboshi's English voice actress Minnie Driver stated that she was interested in \"the challenge of playing [a] woman who supports industry and represents the interests of man, in terms of achievement and greed.\" Driver viewed Eboshi as \"a warrior, an innovator and a protector.\"\n* Kaoru Kobayashi provides the voice of Jiko-bō (ジコ坊, called \"Jigo\" in the English version), a monk and mercenary who befriends Ashitaka on his journey to the west. Miyazaki was unsure whether to make Jiko-bō a government spy, a ninja, a member of a religious group or \"a very good guy.\" He eventually decided to give him elements of all of the above groups.[5] In the English version, Jigo is voiced by Billy Bob Thornton.\n* Masahiko Nishimura voices Kohroku (甲六, *Kōroku*), an ox driver; John DeMita voices Kohroku in the English version. Miyazaki wrote Kohroku to be \"an ordinary guy [who] didn't do anything heroic, right to the end\", something he stated was contrary to films he had made up to that point.[5]\n* Tsunehiko Kamijō provides the voice of Gonza (ゴンザ), Eboshi's short-tempered but loyal bodyguard; he is voiced by John DiMaggio in the English version.\n* Akihiro Miwa voices Moro (モロの君, *Moro no Kimi*), a giant wolf god and San's adopted mother; Gillian Anderson provides her voice in the English version.\n* Mitsuko Mori provides the voice of Hii-sama (ヒイ様), the wise woman of Ashitaka's village.

This writer's block prompted him to accept a request for the creation of the *On Your Mark* promotional music video for the Chage and Aska song of the same title. According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of *Princess Mononoke*. In April 1995, supervising animator Masashi Ando devised the character designs from Miyazaki's storyboard. In May 1995, Miyazaki and Ando went to the ancient forests of Yakushima, of Kyushu, an inspiration for the landscape of *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, and the mountains of Shirakami-Sanchi in northern Honshu[12][13] for location scouting along with a group of art directors, background artists and digital animators for three days.[10] Animation production commenced in July 1995.[11] Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000 cels in the film,[14][15] and is estimated to have retouched parts of 80,000 of them.[16] The final storyboards of the film's ending were finished only months before the Japanese premiere date.[17]\n\n\nInspired by John Ford, an Irish-American director best known for his Westerns, Miyazaki created Irontown as a \"tight-knit frontier town\" and populated it with \"characters from outcast groups and oppressed minorities who rarely, if ever, appear in Japanese films.\" He made the characters \"yearning, ambitious and tough.\"[18][*non-primary source needed*] Miyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of Medieval Japan, and wanted to \"portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization.\"[19][*non-primary source needed*] Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of *Princess Mononoke* depicts a \"symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races (the Jomon, Yamato and Emishi).\"[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)3D rendering was used to create writhing demon flesh and composite it onto a hand-drawn Ashitaka.\n*Princess Mononoke* was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million).[21][22][23][*better source needed*] It was mostly hand-drawn, but incorporates some use of computer animation in approximately ten percent of the film.[24] The computer-animated parts are designed to blend in and support the traditional cel animation, and are mainly used in images consisting of a mixture of computer-generated graphics and traditional drawing. A further 10 minutes uses digital ink and paint, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films.[25] Telecom Animation Film Company and Oh! Production helped animate the film. Toei Animation and DR Movie helped with the painting process.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTwo titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as *Princess Mononoke*. The other title can be translated into English as *The Legend of Ashitaka* (アシタカ𦻙記, *Ashitaka Sekki*), and it contains an uncommon kanji 𦻙 that represents \"a legend passed down from ear to ear without being recorded in official history\", according to Miyazaki. In a Tokyo Broadcasting System program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Miyazaki had preferred *The Legend of Ashitaka* as the title while Suzuki himself favoured *Princess Mononoke*, though the former title was eventually reused for the first song on the soundtrack.[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"Princess Mononoke\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nA central theme of *Princess Mononoke* is the environment.[28] The film centers on the adventure of Ashitaka as he journeys to the west to undo a fatal curse inflicted upon him by Nago, a boar turned into a demon by Eboshi.[29] Michelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film \"makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters\". In the case of the deer god's destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the \"supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources\".[30] They also characterized Eboshi as a businesswoman who has a desire to make money at the expense of the forest, and also cite Eboshi's intention to destroy the forest to mine the mountain \"embodies environmentalist evil\".[29] Deirdre M. Pike writes that Princess Mononoke is simultaneously part of nature and part of the problem.[31] Mononoke represents the connection between the environment and humans, but also demonstrates that there is an imbalance in power between the two.[31]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality and disability[edit]\n\n\nTwo other themes found in the plot of *Princess Mononoke* are sexuality and disability. Speaking at the International Symposium on Leprosy / Hansen's Disease History in Tokyo, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, \"said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma\", after visiting the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium near his home in Tokyo.[32] Lady Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to \"cure [her] poor lepers\".[33] Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the University of Wyoming, and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that \"embraces modern social systems, such as industrialization, gendered division of labor, institutionalization of people with diseases, and militarization of men and women.\" They likened Lady Eboshi to a monarch.[34] Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshi's disregard of ancient laws and curses towards sex workers and lepers was enlightenment reasoning and her exploitation of disabled people furthered her modernist viewpoints.[35] Kim and Jarman conclude that Lady Eboshi's supposed benevolence in incorporating lepers and sex workers into her society leverages the social stigma attached to marginalized groups, pointing out that the hierarchical structures within Irontown still support the stigmatization of lepers and sex workers.[36]\n\n\n\n### Development versus preservation[edit]\n\n\nAn additional theme is the morally ambiguous conflict between humankind's growth and development and Nature's need for preservation. According to the *Chicago Sun-Times*'s Roger Ebert, \"It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.\"[37] Billy Crudup, who provided the English voice for Ashitaka, said \"The movie was such an entirely different experience; it had a whole new sensibility I had never seen in animation. It also had something profound to say: that there has to be a give and take between man and nature. One of the things that really impressed me is that Miyazaki shows life in all its multi-faceted complexity, without the traditional perfect heroes and wicked villains. Even Lady Eboshi, who Ashitaka respects, is not so much evil as short-sighted.\" Minnie Driver, the English voice actress for Lady Eboshi, commented similarly: \"It's one of the most remarkable things about the film: Miyazaki gives a complete argument for both sides of the battle between technological achievement and our spiritual roots in the forest. He shows that good and evil, violence and peace exist in us all. It's all about how you harmonize it all.\"[*citation needed*] Anime historian Susan J. Napier said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in *Princess Mononoke*, unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple points of view the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.[38]\n\n\n\n### Loss of innocence[edit]\n\n\nDan Jolin of *Empire* said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, *Porco Rosso*, and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as *Kiki's Delivery Service*, where he has been quoted as saying \"It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we're happy?\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Duality[edit]\n\n\nDuality is central to Eboshi's characterization. Benjamin Thevenin, Assistant Professor of Theater and Media Arts at Brigham Young University, said Eboshi does not fully understand the harm she does to the spirits. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a haven for former sex workers and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontown's inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to help her own people. Thevenin concluded that although Eboshi can be seen as the film's villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general.[40]\n\n\n\n### Non-duality[edit]\n\n\nAt first glance Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke suggest a very dualistic and dichotomous view of life. Lady Eboshi works for the survival of humankind and San for the survival of nature. But Miyazaki, through the character of Ashitaka, argues that we should accept a non-dualistic view of living, accepting that nature and humans coexist. Ashitaka acts as a healer, mediating between humanity and nature. Ashitaka's curse, obtained while defending his people from a demonized boar god, ultimately symbolizes the destructive force of life, forcing him to recognize the commonalities present in the conflict between industrialized society and nature. Ashitaka’s quest for a cure by the Great Forest Spirit symbolizes humanity’s quest to find a way to live on earth that accepts the interbeing of all of earth's creatures. Ashitaka takes responsibility for the preservation and restoration of nature when he returns the Great Forest Spirit’s head, transferring the guardianship of nature from the now dead Great Forest Spirit to humanity. With guardianship of nature delegated to humanity, the dichotomy between humanity and nature is dismantled and the two forces are tasked with recognizing their coexistence.[41]\n\n\n\n### Individualism and conformity[edit]\n\n\nAnother theme in this film is between individualism and societal conformity. According to University of Bristol professors Christos Ellinas, Neil Allan and Anders Johansson, this struggle can be seen between San, a strong individualistic force, and Eboshi, the leader of a great society. San has fully committed to living with the wolves in the forest and to renouncing her association with the human race. Eboshi has vowed to sustain her society of Irontown by any means including destroying the environment. The people of Irontown have a cohesive ideology and agree with Eboshi to protect Irontown at the cost of the environment's destruction. This conformity can be found within their society, because \"even though there is an envisioned culture which an organization abides to, achieving coherence at lower aggregation levels (e.g. individuals) is increasingly challenging due to its emergent nature\".[42]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997.[43] The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both anime fans and arthouse moviegoers in English-speaking countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSince Walt Disney Studios had made a distribution deal with Tokuma Shoten for Studio Ghibli's films in 1996, it was the first film from Studio Ghibli along with *Kiki's Delivery Service* and *Castle in the Sky* to have been dubbed into English by Disney; in this case, subsidiary Miramax Films was assigned to release the movie in the US on October 29, 1999.[*citation needed*] In response to demands from Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein to edit the film, Toshio Suzuki sent Weinstein a samurai sword with the message: \"No cuts.\"[44][45] Promotion manager Steve Alpert revealed that Weinstein had wanted to trim the film down from 135 minutes to 90 minutes \"despite having promised not to do so.\" When Alpert informed him that Miyazaki would not agree to these demands, Weinstein flew into one of his infamous rages and threatened Alpert that he would \"never work in this...industry again\".[45]\n\n\nWeinstein hired Neil Gaiman to write the English script, and he chose to simplify some of the Japanese terminology for this dub, with words like *Jibarashi* becoming \"Mercenary\" and *Shishigami* becoming \"Forest Spirit\". According to him at one of the American screenings of the dub, the release was somewhat delayed because the original recordings deviated from the English script as written.[*citation needed*] Despite Gaiman's independent fame as an author, his role as scriptwriter for the dub was not heavily promoted: Studio Ghibli requested that Miramax remove some executives' names from the poster for the film, but the executives (Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein, and Scott Martin) decided that Gaiman's name was contractually expendable.[46]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2000, the English-dub version of *Princess Mononoke* was released theatrically in Japan along with the documentary *Mononoke hime in U.S.A.*[43] The documentary was directed by Toshikazu Sato and featured Miyazaki visiting the Walt Disney Studios and various film festivals.[47] The film had a limited theatrical re-release in the United States during July 2018,[48] and again during April 2022 for the 25th anniversary of its original Japanese release.[49]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* was the highest-grossing Japanese film of 1997, earning ¥11.3 billion in distribution rental earnings.[50] It became the highest-grossing film in Japan, beating the record set by *E.T.* in 1982, but was surpassed several months later by *Titanic*.[51] The film earned total domestic gross receipts of ¥20.18 billion.[52]\n\n\nIt was the top-grossing anime film in the United States in January 2001, but because its US release was only in select theaters, the film did not fare as well financially in the country when released in October 1999. It grossed $2,298,191 for the first eight weeks.[53][48] It showed more strength internationally, where it earned a total of $11 million outside Japan, bringing its worldwide total to $159,375,308 at the time.[48] On December 6, 2016, GKIDS announced that it would screen the film in US cinemas on January 5 and January 9, 2017, to celebrate its 20th anniversary,[54] bundled with the *On Your Mark* short.[55] The film's limited US re-release in 2018 grossed $1,423,877 over five days, bringing its US total to $3,799,185 and worldwide total to $160,799,185.[48] As of 2020[update], the film has grossed $194.3 million.[1]\n\n\nFor its 25th anniversary, Princess Mononoke was screened in 35mm at New York City's Japan Society on July 22, 2022.[56]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the film was released on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on June 26, 1998. A LaserDisc edition was also released by Tokuma Japan Communications on the same day. The film was released on DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on November 21, 2001, with bonus extras added, including the international versions of the film as well as the storyboards.[*citation needed*] By 2007, *Princess Mononoke* sold 4.4 million DVD units in Japan.[57]\n\n\nIn July 2000, Buena Vista Home Entertainment via Miramax Home Entertainment announced plans to release the film on VHS and DVD in North America on August 29.[58] Initially, the DVD version of *Princess Mononoke* wasn't going to include the Japanese-language track at the request of Buena Vista's Japan division. Because the film hadn't been released on DVD in Japan yet, there were concerns that \"a foreign-released DVD containing the Japanese language track will allow for the importation of such a DVD to Japan, which could seriously hurt the local sales of a future release of the [film]\".[59] The fansite Nausicaa.net organized an email campaign for fans to include the Japanese language track,[59] while DVD Talk began an online petition to retain the Japanese language track.[60] The DVD release of *Princess Mononoke* was delayed as a result.[61] Miramax Home Entertainment released the DVD on December 19, 2000 with the original Japanese audio, the English dubbed audio and extras including a trailer and a documentary with interviews from the English dub voice actors.[62] The film was released on Blu-ray disc in Japan on December 4, 2013.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Princess Mononoke* on Blu-ray Disc on November 18, 2014.[*citation needed*] In its first week, it sold 21,860 units; by November 23, 2014, it had grossed $502,332.[63] It was later included in Disney's \"The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki\" Blu-ray set, released on November 17, 2015.[64] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[65] As of October 2020[update], the film has grossed $9,232,906 from Blu-ray sales in the United States.[63]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015 (below five other Studio Ghibli anime films),[66] number ten in 2016,[67] number five in 2018 (below four other Japanese films),[68] and number three in 2019 (below *Spirited Away* and *My Neighbor Totoro*).[69]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on January 22, 1999. It was NTV's second-most-watched film at the time with a 35.1% audience rating, below *Spirited Away*.[70]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 117 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads, \"With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, *Princess Mononoke* is a landmark in the world of animation.\"[71] On Metacritic, it has an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indictating \"generally favorable reviews\".[72]\n\n\n*The Daily Yomiuri*'s Aaron Gerow called the film a \"powerful compilation of Miyazaki's world, a cumulative statement of his moral and filmic concerns.\"[73] Leonard Klady of *Variety* said that *Princess Mononoke* \"is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script\" and the film \"has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema's most grand canvases\".[74] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called *Princess Mononoke* \"a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year. […] You won't find many Hollywood love stories (animated or otherwise) so philosophical.\"[75] Ty Burr of *Entertainment Weekly* called the film \"a windswept pinnacle of its art\" and that it \"has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story\".[76] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* said that the film \"brings a very different sensibility to animation, a medium [Miyazaki] views as completely suitable for straight dramatic narrative and serious themes.\"[77] In his review, Dave Smith from *Gamers' Republic* called it \"one of the greatest animated films ever created, and easily one of the best films of 1999.\"[78]\n\n\nRoger Ebert placed *Princess Mononoke* sixth on his top ten movies of 1999.[79] In 2001, the Japanese magazine *Animage* ranked *Princess Mononoke* 47th in their list of *100 Best Anime Productions of All Time*.[80] It ranked 488th on *Empire*'s list of the 500 greatest films.[81] Time Out ranked the film 26th on 50 greatest animated films.[82] It also ranked 26 on *Total Film'*s list of 50 greatest animated films.[83]\n\n\nJames Cameron cited *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on his 2009 film *Avatar*. He acknowledged that it shares themes with *Princess Mononoke*, including its clash between cultures and civilizations, and cited *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[84]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is the first animated feature film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Best Picture.[85] For the 70th Academy Awards ceremony, *Princess Mononoke* was the Japanese submission to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not successfully nominated.[86] Hayao Miyazaki was also nominated for an Annie Award for his work on the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | 52nd Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Princess Mononoke* | Won\n | [87] |\n| Best Animation Film | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| Japanese Movie Fans' Choice\n | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| 10th Nikkan Sports Film Awards | Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki\n | [*citation needed*] |\n| Yūjirō Ishihara Award | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| 1st Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 1998\n | 21st Japan Academy Awards | Picture of the Year | *Princess Mononoke* | [85] |\n| 40th Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 22nd Hochi Film Awards | Special Award\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 2000\n | 28th Annie Awards | Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production\n | Hayao Miyazaki  (English language version)\n | Nominated\n | [88] |\n| 4th Golden Satellite Awards | Best Animated or Mixed Media Film\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 2001\n | 27th Saturn Awards | Best Home Video Release\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Won\n | [*citation needed*] |\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The music was performed by Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Hiroshi Kumagai. The soundtrack was released in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications on July 2, 1997, and the North American version was released by Milan Records on October 12, 1999.\n\n\nThe titular theme song was performed by counter-tenor Yoshikazu Mera. For the English adaptation, Sasha Lazard sang the song.\nDuring the movie Hisaishi makes use of a few known classical pieces and quotes them, such as Dmitri Shostakovich's 5th symphony.\nAs with other Studio Ghibli films, additional albums featuring soundtrack themes in alternative versions have been released. The image album features early versions of the themes, recorded at the beginning of the film production process, and used as source of inspiration for the various artists involved. The symphonic suite features longer compositions, each encompassing several of the movie themes, performed by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mario Klemens.\n\n\n\n## Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that Studio Ghibli and British theatre company Whole Hog Theatre would be bringing *Princess Mononoke* to the stage. It is the first stage adaptation of a Studio Ghibli work.[89] The contact between Whole Hog Theatre and Studio Ghibli was facilitated by Nick Park of Aardman Animations after he sent footage of Whole Hog performances to Studio Ghibli's Toshio Suzuki.[90] The play features large puppets made out of recycled and reclaimed materials.[91]\n\n\nThe first performances were scheduled for London's New Diorama Theatre and sold out in 72 hours, a year in advance.[92][93] In March 2013, it was announced that the show would transfer to Japan after its first run of shows in London. A second series of performances followed in London after the return from Tokyo. The second run of London performances sold out in four and half hours.[94][95] The play received positive reviews and was one of Lyn Gardner's theatre picks in *The Guardian*.[96][97][98][99][100] On April 27, 2013, the play was presented at Nico Nico Douga's Cho Party and was streamed online in Japan.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Loo, Egan (December 15, 2020). \"Spirited Away, 3 Other Ghibli Films' Box Office Totals Rose Due to This Year's Revival Screenings\". *Anime News Network*.

So as long as each cel reaches that standard, the less work for me.\n17. **^** Toshio Uratani (2004). *Princess Mononoke: Making of a Masterpiece* (Documentary).

It is loosely based on the 1986 novel of the same name by British author Diana Wynne Jones. The film was produced by Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli and distributed by Toho. The Japanese voice cast featured Chieko Baisho and Takuya Kimura, while the English dub version starred Jean Simmons, Emily Mortimer, Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Josh Hutcherson and Billy Crystal. The film is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early twentieth-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. It tells the story of Sophie, a young milliner who is turned into an elderly woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.\n\n\nInfluenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, the film contains strong anti-war themes. Miyazaki stated that he \"had a great deal of rage\" about the Iraq war, which led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the United States.[1] It also explores the theme of old age, depicting age positively as something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains feminist elements as well, and carries messages about the value of compassion. In 2013, Miyazaki said *Howl's Moving Castle* was his favorite creation, explaining, \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"[2] The film is significantly thematically different from the novel; while the novel focuses on challenging class and gender norms, the film focuses on love, personal loyalty and the destructive effects of war.[3]\n\n\n*Howl's Moving Castle* premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival on 5 September 2004, and was theatrically released in Japan on 20 November 2004. It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $236 million worldwide, making it one of the most commercially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, with particular praise toward its visuals and Miyazaki's presentation of the themes. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 78th Academy Awards, but lost to *Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit*. It won several other awards, including four Tokyo Anime Awards and a Nebula Award for Best Script.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nSophie, a young milliner and eldest of three sisters, encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl's moving castle where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, the source of the castle's magic and movement. Calcifer makes a deal with Sophie, agreeing to break her curse if she breaks his link with Howl. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, which is searching for its missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King, under the pretense of being his mother, to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's head sorceress, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power and reverting her to her true age, that of a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight for the king. Howl then arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him by turning him into a monster, but with Sophie's help he remembers himself and just barely avoids death. The duo escapes along with the former Witch of the Waste and Suliman's dog Heen. In the meantime, soldiers from each kingdom break into the homes of both Jenkins and Pendragon (Howl's aliases in those kingdoms). However, the men only find an empty courtyard and warehouse, as the castle's magic nature allows travel between four separate residences.\n\n\nSophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the house and Sophie's hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of the Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The remainder of the castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\n\n\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star – Calcifer – and gives him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom. He reveals that only his true love's kiss can break his curse. After seeing Sophie's affection lies with Howl, he promptly heads for home to cease the war, but promises he will see them again. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, also decides to end the war. Sometime later, bombers fly under dark skies over a recovered and green countryside headed to another war, while Sophie, Howl, and the others travel in the opposite direction in a new flying castle.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nChieko Baisho, who voiced Sophie in the Japanese version of the film\n![Picture of Emily Mortimer dressed in white against a green background](image)\nEmily Mortimer, who voiced the young Sophie in the version of the film dubbed into English\n![Publicity still of Jean Simmons](image)\nJean Simmons, who voiced older Sophie in the English dub\n\n\n\n| Character\n | Japanese voice actor[4] | English dubbing actor[5] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sophie Hatter (ソフィー・ハッター, *Sofī Hattā*) | Chieko Baisho | Emily Mortimer (young)Jean Simmons (old) |\n| Howl (ハウル, *Hauru*) | Takuya Kimura | Christian Bale |\n| Witch of the Waste (荒地の魔女, *Arechi no Majo*) | Akihiro Miwa | Lauren Bacall |\n| Calcifer (カルシファー, *Karushifā*) | Tatsuya Gashuin[6] | Billy Crystal |\n| Markl (マルクル, *Marukuru*) | Ryūnosuke Kamiki[6] | Josh Hutcherson |\n| Suliman (サリマン, *Sariman*) | Haruko Kato | Blythe Danner |\n| Lettie (レティー, *Retī*) | Yayoi Kazuki | Jena Malone |\n| Honey (ハニー, *Hanī*) | Mayuno Yasokawa | Mari Devon |\n| Prince Justin / Turnip Head (カブ, *Kabu*) | Yō Ōizumi | Crispin Freeman |\n| King of Ingary (国王, *Kokuō*) | Akio Ōtsuka | Mark Silverman\n |\n| Heen (ヒン, *Hin*) | Daijiro Harada | Dee Bradley Baker (uncredited)[7] |\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Pacifism[edit]\n\n\n*Howl's Moving Castle* contains strong anti-war themes, influenced by Miyazaki's distaste for the 2003 Iraq War.[8] When he received an Oscar for *Spirited Away*, he said that he \"had a great deal of rage about [the war]. So [he] felt some hesitation about the award.\"[1] Miyazaki identifies as a pacifist.[9] On the eve of the Iraq War, Miyazaki decided to make a film that he felt would be poorly received in the United States. Despite the film's success in that country, literary scholar Dani Cavallaro stated that Miyazaki was able to \"create a film which ought, in principle, to have caused a certain unease among American audiences.\"[1] In the movie, Madame Suliman appears to have only sadistic motivations for creating conflict,[1] and despite being omniscient, is unable to recognize the idiocy of the war until the very end of the story. This reflects Miyazaki's desire to show real-world conflicts as also being somewhat arbitrary and fueled by the desires of capricious people.[10] Cavallaro stated that the depiction of the war carried \"an unmistakable bitter taste.\"[1] She also writes that the military presence and warfare was highlighted in the film.[11]\n\n\nThe universe of *Howl's Moving Castle* is depicted as not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change.[12] Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message of the film is that \"war is bad.\"[13] A scene where Sophie is standing in a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, \"a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace.\"[14] This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like *Princess Mononoke*, which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner.[13] Andrew Osmond stated that \"Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all,\" in the form of the monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at one point that he will soon not be able to return to human form. In contrast, Ashitaka in *Princess Mononoke* fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides. Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of masculinity, as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.[13]\n\n\n\n### Flight and critique of modernity[edit]\n\n\nLike several other Miyazaki films, *Howl's Moving Castle* reflects the director's love of flying.[12] Aircraft of inventive design appear in the film, and Howl frequently transforms into a bird.[15] Miyazaki examines flight as a theme most directly in the later film *The Wind Rises*. Miyazaki stated that he was attracted to military aircraft as a child, but that he grew to detest them because of the destructive purpose for which they are created. Thus *Howl's Moving Castle* contains images both of aircraft shown as harmless and beautiful, and large military craft depicted as ugly and destructive.[15] Cavallaro writes that Miyazaki wants to \"portray flight as an object of admiration and awe,\" but that he is not \"[blind] to its abuse by unscrupulous strategists and rulers.\"[15]\n\n\nThe nuanced view of flight is part of Miyazaki's broader critique of modern society and technology. Margaret Talbot writes that in person, Miyazaki exhibits \"a profound dissatisfaction with modern life,\" particularly with the effects of technology and a disconnection from nature.[12] Many of his films depict technological hubris as among the roots of evil.[16] The battleships which are seen moving over the landscape are depicted as \"gleaming with modernity and parading righteousness,\" but are then shown to be highly destructive.[17] In contrast, the semi-organic castle demonstrates \"Miyazaki’s Taoist presentation of industrialism needing to be aligned with nature\" according to Carl and Garrath Wilson.[17] Anthony Lioi writes that Miyazaki often depicts beautiful scenes in contrast to those containing symbols of modernity, such as the scene where Sophie's reverie is interrupted by a war machine. This contrast is part of an ecological criticism of modernity, but Miyazaki also offers an alternative, in the form of beautiful natural scenery.[14]\n\n\n\n### Old age and compassion[edit]\n\n\nMiyazaki stated that an attractive aspect of the story of *Howl's Moving Castle* was the relatively positive light it shed on growing old.[12] When Sophie becomes old as a result of the witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in *Howl's Moving Castle*, which made it a risky concept.[12] Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of \"aged unattractiveness,\" when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who come to love her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country.[18] Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic.[18] Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films.[14] According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well.[18] Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.[18]\n\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki stated that *Howl's Moving Castle* was his favorite creation, and explained his choice by saying \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"[2] In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion.[2] Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in *Princess Mononoke* and Sheeta and Pazu in *Castle in the Sky* learn to survive by learning the same lesson.[2] Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains.[2] Over the course of the film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself.[18] When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion.[18] The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that \"In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, and they can not be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches.\"[18] They are also given a lot of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.[18]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![Picture of Miyazaki holding a microphone](image)\nDirector and screenwriter Hayao Miyazaki in 2009\n![refer to caption](image)\nToshio Suzuki, who produced the film, at its premiere\n\nIn September 2001, Studio Ghibli announced the production of two films. The first would become *The Cat Returns* and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, *Howl's Moving Castle*.[19] Toshio Suzuki, who produced *Howl's Moving Castle*, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside.[20] The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs.[12] The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to the various situations.[21] The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels, and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.[21]\n\n\nMamoru Hosoda of Toei Animation was originally selected to direct the film, but quit the project after Studio Ghibli's executives rejected many of his concept ideas. The film was shelved until Miyazaki took over.[22] The project resumed production in February 2003.[19] It was scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2004, and released in the summer of that year.[22]\n\n\nMiyazaki went to Colmar and Riquewihr in Alsace, France, to study the architecture and the surroundings for the setting of the film.[21] Additional inspiration came from the concepts of futuristic technology in Albert Robida's work.[23] Commentators have stated that Miyazaki's imagery was influenced by his fondness for the \"illusion art\" of 19th-century Europe.[24] Suzuki stated that unlike many Western films, in which the imagery went \"from the general [to] the specific,\"[12] Miyazaki employed a uniquely Japanese approach, frequently beginning with a very specific image and moving from there.[12] However, *Howl's Moving Castle*, and Miyazaki films in general, have a focus on realistic imagery in a way that other anime films do not.[12]\n\n\nThe film was produced digitally, but the original backgrounds were drawn by hand and painted prior to being digitized, and the characters were also drawn by hand prior to scanning them into the computer.[25] The 1400 storyboard cuts for the film were completed on 16 January 2004.[26] On 25 June the in-between animation was completed and checking was completed on 26 June.[27] Studio Ghibli used digital technology to run many copies of the still portions of a scene, a process which avoids inconsistencies between various still frames, but can create an impression of artificiality. Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the \"feel\" of a hand-drawn image.[28]\n\n\nLike with the other Studio Ghibli movies, the film was co-produced with other companies, which were Tokuma Shoten, the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi and Toho.[29]\n\n\n\n## Comparisons between film and novel[edit]\n\n\nThe film has several differences from the novel, partly due to the different requirements of the two media. Diana Wynne Jones' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film.[30] As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her.[31] Jones discussed the film with Studio Ghibli representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying \"It's fantastic. No, I have no input—I write books, not films. Yes, it will be *different* from the book—in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film.\"[32]\n\n\nThe novel depicts Howl's castle as a tall, dark and sinister wizard's tower, very different from the complex image in the film. The film's castle may be seen as a parody of the machines seen in the movie, driven both by steam-engines and by magic. In the film, it is a \"rotund collage of chimneys, roofs, steam pipes, and other odd appendages, borne along on mechanized bird legs\"[31] that is similar to Baba Yaga's hut in the popular fairy tale. It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form.[31] Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the \"endearing\" persona and image that he has in the film.[31] Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a fantasy universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or washing up, in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe.[33] In the novel, Jones disrupts the fantasy-world setting by including scenes in which the characters travel to the real-world Wales. The movie, however, avoids this digression, and maintains a constant setting.[34]\n\n\nMiyazaki's biggest addition to the plot of the book was the use of the war as a large part of the plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war.[35] Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person.[35] In the film, however, Howl disappears in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.[35]\n\n\nThe roles of several characters also differ between novel and film due to this plot change. The Witch of the Waste is the chief antagonist of the book, whereas in the film she is reduced by Madame Suliman's magic to an ultimately harmless old woman who evokes sympathy in the audience and in Sophie.[35] In contrast, the film conflates the novel's two characters of Mrs. Penstemmon and the wizard Suliman into Madame Suliman. Although Suliman comes closest to being a traditional villain in the film, she is shown as having ambiguous motivations, and reviewers have stated that the real villain is war itself.[35] Howl loses the \"rakish\" womanizing aspect that was a significant part of his character in the novel.[35] In contrast, Sophie becomes a more conventional figure in the film; she is less grumpy and outspoken, and demonstrates her love for Howl earlier and more explicitly.[35] The storyline in the novel of Sophie being a powerful sorceress in her own right is muted in the film, although she is still shown to have control over her curse.[3]\n\n\nThe thematic focus of the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote that the experience of watching the film was similar to reading high quality fan fiction; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different.[3] Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that \"Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format to tell a story about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters to tell a story about personal loyalty, love, and war.\"[3]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Howl's Moving Castle*\n\n![](image)Joe Hisaishi, who composed and conducted the score, in 2011\nThe score was composed and conducted by Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic.[36] The soundtrack CD was first released on 19 November 2004 by Tokuma Japan Communications. Hisaishi also composed and conducted a *Howl's Moving Castle: Symphony Suite*, an album published on 21 January 2004 which includes ten re-arranged pieces from the original soundtrack. He and Youmi Kimura also composed *Howl's Moving Castle CD Maxi-Single*, a CD single published on 27 October 2004 which includes the film's theme song, sung by Chieko Baisho (the Japanese voice actor for Sophie), its karaoke version, and a piano version of the film's main theme, \"The Merry-Go-Round of Life\".[37]\n\n\n\n## Release and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nThe film opened at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004,[38] and was released in Japan on 20 November 2004.[39] The film grossed $14.5 million in its first week of release in Japan alone.[12] The film was distributed in Japan by Toho, and made $190 million in that country.[39] It was distributed internationally by various companies, and made approximately an additional $45 million outside Japan, for a worldwide total of $235 million.[39] The film was later dubbed into English under the supervision of Pete Docter of Pixar, and released in the United States by Walt Disney Pictures on 10 June 2005.[40][39] It was one of the most commercially successful Japanese films ever made.[38] Soon after its release, it became the third most financially successful film in Japan, behind *Titanic* and *Spirited Away*.[16]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nOn home video, *Howl's Moving Castle* sold 2.7 million DVD units in Japan as of May 2007[update],[41] and grossed over $18 million from Blu-ray and DVD sales in the United States as of April 2022[update].[42] It was released in the United States on DVD on 7 March 2006 and on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 21 May 2013.[43] GKIDS re-released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017.[44]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release was 2015's eighth best-selling foreign language film on home video, and fifth best-selling Japanese film (below four other Studio Ghibli anime films).[45] It was later 2018's fourth best-selling foreign language film in the UK (below the Japanese films *My Neighbor Totoro*, *Your Name* and *Blade of the Immortal*).[46]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 87% approval rating based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exquisitely illustrated by master animator Miyazaki, *Howl's Moving Castle* will delight children with its fantastical story and touch the hearts and minds of older viewers as well.\"[43] The film also holds an 82/100 average on Metacritic, based on 40 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[6]\n\n\n*USA Today* critic Claudia Puig gave the film a positive review, praising it for its ability to blend \"a childlike sense of wonder with sophisticated emotions and motives\".[47] Helen McCarthy in *500 Essential Anime Movies* said that the natural world was \"beautifully represented\", with \"some absolutely breathtaking mountains and lakeside landscapes\". She also praised the design of the castle and added that Miyazaki added his own themes to the film: \"man's relationship to nature, the futility of war, and the joy of flight\".[48] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* called the film \"a moveable feast of delights\".[49] Richard Corliss of *Time* wrote, \"Palaces and shimmering lakes, warplanes and fire sprites all come to life at the breath of Miyazaki's graphic genius.\"[50] Writing for *The Boston Globe*, Ty Burr said, \"At its best, 'Howl's Moving Castle' offers a rich fantasy of adolescent escape, of romance in the old and epic sense. At its worst, it's the most amazing 12-course meal you can't bring yourself to finish.\"[51] A.O. Scott of *The New York Times* wrote, \"Admirers of [Hayao Miyazaki's] work, which is wildly imaginative, emotionally intense and surpassingly gentle, will find much to appreciate in this film because it demonstrates, once again, his visual ingenuity and his sensitivity as a storyteller. For newcomers to his world, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a fitting introduction to one of modern cinema's great enchanters.\"[52]\n\n\nConversely, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film two and a half out of four stars, and called it a \"disappointment\" compared to Miyazaki's other recent movies.[53] Jonathan Trout of the BBC said, \"Youngsters and Miyazaki fans will coo at the world's depth and rich surreality, but opaque plotting, and a tendency to mope with Sophie whilst Howl is off affecting events let the momentum of the first act vanish into thin air.\"[54] Writing for *Salon*, Stephanie Zacharek said, \"the plot of *Howl's Moving Castle* meanders so listlessly that its details become less and less charming. Miyazaki's storytelling style resembles that of a breathless young tot who's fearlessly exercising his newfound powers of expression.\"[55] Stephen Hunter from *The Washington Post* criticized the plot of the film, saying \"There is no story, or rather, there's no force to the story, which meanders almost casually this way and that for no apparent reason.\"[56] However, he said that the movie also empowered young women, and was \"beautiful beyond telling.\"[56] David Rooney, writing in *Variety*, stated that \"the narrative motor roars ahead in the opening hour and is more erratic thereafter,\" and suggested that better translation would help.[29] Literary scholar Matt Kimmich stated that the film came across as \"uneasy compromise between two plots and two imaginations,\" referring to Jones' original story and Miyazaki's style of animation and storytelling.[57] However, he stated that those scenes which were not dependent either on Jones' original plot or Miyazaki's added plot threads found \"a visual humor that recalls the verbal wit and lightness of Jones's novel,\"[58] and that the \"animation manages to free itself from the demands of the two plots—and flies.\"[58]\n\n\n\n### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n> \n> There's a word for the kind of comic, dramatic, romantic, transporting visions Miyazaki achieves in *Howl's*: bliss.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Peter Travers, *Rolling Stone*[40]\n\nThe film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2005.[59]\n\n\n\n* 2nd – Ella Taylor, *LA Weekly* (tie)\n* 4th – Kenneth Turan, *Los Angeles Times*\n* 5th – Tasha Robinson, *The A.V.

With a budget of US$19 million, production of *Spirited Away* began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nOriginally released in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho, the film received universal acclaim,[12] grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office.[a][13] Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥31.68 billion ($305 million).[14] It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train* in 2020.[15]\n\n\nA co-recipient of the Golden Bear with *Bloody Sunday* at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and the first, and to date only, hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards,[16] *Spirited Away* is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various \"best-of\" lists.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's plot summary **may be too long or excessively detailed.** Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. *(November 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nTen-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Her father stops to explore an abandoned amusement park despite Chihiro's protests. They find a restaurant stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents begin to eat. While exploring alone, Chihiro finds a bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to leave. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have become pigs, and the exit is blocked by an ocean of water.\n\n\nHaku finds Chihiro and leads her toward the bathhouse. She sees several animals and creatures visiting the bathhouse, as well as No-Face (顔無し, *Kaonashi*), a masked spirit. Haku instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji says that he already has enough susuwatari to help him. After Chihiro tries to help but inadvertently causes some disruption, Kamaji asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse.\n\n\nYubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but Chihiro persists. Eventually, Yubaba reveals she took an oath to give work to anyone who asks for it, and gives Chihiro a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second kanji of her name (千尋), renaming her Sen (千). Haku reveals he is also working for Yubaba.\n\n\nThe bathhouse workers dislike Sen, but give her work as Lin's assistant. Later that night, when Yubaba leaves, Haku finds Sen and shows her her parents, who are being held in pigpens. Haku explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world. Sen is ostracized by the other workers. While working, she invites No-Face inside, accidentally believing him to be a customer.\n\n\nThe spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's first customer. Sen discovers a bicycle handle sticking out of him, and the workers help to remove the bicycle and a large amount of garbage. He gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it before swallowing him. He demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers. Meanwhile, Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When he crashes into Yubaba's penthouse with grievous injuries, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami stows away on her back.\n\n\nNo-Face is given large amounts of food, but soon begins eating more workers. In the penthouse, the stowaway shikigami shapeshifts into Yubaba's sister, Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse. Sen, Haku, and Boh fall into the boiler room. Sen feeds Haku part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up a seal he stole, saving him from its deadly curse. Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba, taking Boh with her. She confronts an engorged No-Face, who reveals he is very lonely. Sen feeds No-Face the rest of the dumpling, and he follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Lin takes Sen to the station to see Zeniba, and Sen invites No-Face to follow, despite Lin's protests. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel with train tickets given to Sen by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing.\n\n\nHaku offers to retrieve Boh if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test. Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband. Haku appears in dragon form, and Sen, Boh, and Haku leave for the bathhouse, leaving No-Face with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen discovers Haku's identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, *Nigihayami Kohakunushi*). When they arrive, Sen passes Yubaba's test to identify her parents, and she is allowed to leave. Haku vows to see her again, but she leaves the city with her parents, who do not remember anything after the restaurant. After returning to their own world, the family find their car covered with leaves and dust, as the forest around it has become immensely overgrown. They then exit the forest and continue their journey to their new home.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Voice actor\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese (Nihongo)\n | Japanese\n | English\n |\n| Chihiro Ogino / Sen\n | *Ogino Chihiro* (荻野 千尋) / *Sen* (千)[b] | Rumi Hiiragi | Daveigh Chase |\n| Haku / Spirit of the Kohaku River\n | *Haku* (ハク) / *Nigihayami Kohakunushi* (饒速水小白主)[c] | Miyu Irino | Jason Marsden |\n| Yubaba\n | *Yubāba* (湯婆婆)[d] | Mari Natsuki | Suzanne Pleshette |\n| Zeniba\n | *Zeniiba* (銭婆)[e] |\n| Kamaji\n | *Kamajii* (釜爺)[f] | Bunta Sugawara | David Ogden Stiers |\n| Lin\n | *Rin* (リン) | Yoomi Tamai | Susan Egan |\n| Chichiyaku\n | *Chichiyaku* (父役)\n | Tsunehiko Kamijō | Paul Eiding |\n| Aniyaku (assistant Manager)\n | Aniyaku (兄役)\n | Takehiko Ono | John Ratzenberger |\n| No-Face[g] | *Kaonashi* (顔無し)[g] | Akio Nakamura | Bob Bergen |\n| Aogaeru\n | *Aogaeru* (青蛙)[h] | Tatsuya Gashūin |\n| Bandai-gaeru (foreman)\n | *Bandai-gaeru* (番台蛙)[i] | Yō Ōizumi | Rodger Bumpass |\n| Boh (baby)\n | *Bō* (坊)\n | Ryunosuke Kamiki | Tara Strong |\n| Akio Ogino (Chihiro's father)\n | *Ogino Akio* (荻野 明夫)\n | Takashi Naitō | Michael Chiklis |\n| Yūko Ogino (Chihiro's mother)\n | *Ogino Yūko* (荻野 悠子)\n | Yasuko Sawaguchi | Lauren Holly |\n| River Spirit\n | *Kawa no Kami* (河の神)\n | Koba Hayashi | Jim Ward |\n| Radish Spirit\n | *Oshira-sama* (お白様)[j] | Ken Yasuda | Jack Angel |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...]. [I]t's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances [...]. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Hayao Miyazaki[17]\n\nEvery summer, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for *Spirited Away* came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like *Nakayoshi* and *Ribon* the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they \"held dear in their hearts\" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.[17]\n\n\n\n![Close up photograph of Hayao Miyazaki, smiling and wearing a suit and tie in front of a gold-colored mosaic.](image)Hayao Miyazaki used shōjo manga magazines for inspiration to direct *Spirited Away*.\nMiyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals—one based on the Japanese book *Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi* (霧のむこうのふしぎな町) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine—were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming *Spirited Away*, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of *Spirited Away*.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese dragon ascends toward the heavens with Mount Fuji in the background in this print from Ogata Gekkō. *Spirited Away* is heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore.[8]\nProduction of *Spirited Away* commenced in February 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million).[2] Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film's production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution.[18][19] As with *Princess Mononoke*, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a \"pretty girl\". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked \"dull\" and thought, \"She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?\" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel \"she will be a charming woman.\"[17]\n\n\n\n![A medium shot photograph of a hot spring in the city of Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku, Japan.](image)Dōgo Onsen\n![A wide photograph of a hallway from the Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum, which was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.](image)The Takahashi Korekiyo residence in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum was one of Miyazaki's inspirations in creating the spirit world's buildings.Miyazaki based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the buildings in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting – tears well up in my eyes.\"[17] Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (能登谷旅館), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.[20] While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.[21] The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the *Spirited Away* onsen/bathhouse.[22]\n\n\nToshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of *Spirited Away*. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki's own influences by European films such as *The Snow Queen* and *The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep*.[23]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Spirited Away*\n\nThe film score of *Spirited Away* was composed and conducted by Miyazaki's regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic.[24] The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.[25][26][27] Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to \"One Summer's Day\" and named the new version of the song \"The Name of Life\" (いのちの名前, *\"Inochi no Namae\"*) which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.[28]\n\n\nThe closing song, \"Always With Me\" (いつも何度でも, *\"Itsumo Nando Demo\"*, lit. 'Always, No Matter How Many Times') was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka.[29] The lyrics were written by Kimura's friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for *Rin the Chimney Painter* (煙突描きのリン, *Entotsu-kaki no Rin*), a different Miyazaki film which was never released.[29] In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create *Spirited Away*.[29] The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.[30]\n\n\nBesides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled *Spirited Away Image Album* (千と千尋の神隠し　イメージアルバム, *Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Imēji Arubamu*), that contains 10 tracks.[31]\n\n\n\n### English dub[edit]\n\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing *Spirited Away* Lasseter was ecstatic.[32] Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing *Spirited Away* to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: *Beauty and the Beast* co-director Kirk Wise and *Aladdin* co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of *Spirited Away*, respectively.[32] Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\n\n\nThe cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with *Spirited Away* being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of *Disney.com*; Disney had sidelined their official website for *Spirited Away*[32] and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.[19] Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Supernaturalism[edit]\n\n\nThe major themes of *Spirited Away*, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.[8] Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:\n\n\n> In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.[8]\n> \n> \n\nChihiro's archetypal entrance into another world demarcates her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word *kamikakushi* (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'\"[33]\n\n\nAdditional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Fantasy[edit]\n\n\nThe film has been compared to Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass*, as the stories have some elements in common such as being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.[35][36][37] Among other stories compared to *Spirited Away*, *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* is seen to be more closely linked thematically.[36]\n\n\nYubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film *Pinocchio*, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child,[38] who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.[38]\n\n\n\n### Traditional Japanese culture[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.[39] Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the *shōjo*, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.[39] Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.[38] In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.[40]\n\n\nJapanese philosophy plays a huge role in *Spirited Away*, specifically through concepts like *Kami* and principles like *Mottainai* and *On*.[41] The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro's character development.\n\n\n\n### Western consumerism[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to the Japanese concept of *On*, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture.[42] For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees' quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of *chi*, the first character in Chihiro's name, lit. 'one thousand') can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value.[39]\n\n\n\nMiyazaki's film setting encapsulates his commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan's distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film's visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis – the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has \"credit cards and cash\", before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits.[43] Miyazaki has stated:\n\n\n> Chihiro's parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that \"turned into pigs\" during Japan's bubble economy (consumer society) of the 1980s, and these people still haven't realized they've become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don't return to being human but instead gradually start to have the \"body and soul of a pig\". These people are the ones saying, \"We are in a recession and don't have enough to eat.\" This doesn't just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) \"a trap to catch lost humans\".[42]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.[44] Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;[39] it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face.[45] In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.[39]\n\n\n\n### Environmentalism[edit]\n\n\nCommentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In *Spirited Away*, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.[46]\n\n\nThe second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.[47][48]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Box office and theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record ¥1.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by *Princess Mononoke*.[49] It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total.[50] After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001.[51] It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States.[52][53] It went on to gross ¥30.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan.[54] It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by *Titanic*.[55] Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to ¥31.68 billion, as of 2020[update].[56][57]\n\n\nIn February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France.[58] The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.[59]\n\n\nDisney's English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002[60] and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. *Spirited Away* had very little marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002.[19] After the 2003 Oscars,[61] it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003.[62] Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively.[63] In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.[64]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003.[65] The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003.[66][67] The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.[68]\n\n\nAbout 18 years after its original release in Japan, *Spirited Away* had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It follows the theatrical China release of *My Neighbour Totoro* in December 2018.[69] The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[70] It topped the Chinese box office with a $28.8-million opening weekend, beating *Toy Story 4* in China.[71] In its second weekend, *Spirited Away* grossed a cumulative $54.8 million in China, and was second only behind *Spider-Man: Far From Home* that weekend.[72] As of 16 July 2019[update], the film has grossed $70 million in China,[73] bringing its worldwide total box office to over $346 million as of 8 July 2019[update].[74]\n\n\n*Spirited Away*'s worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.[a]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spirited Away* was first released on VHS and DVD formats in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002.[75] The Japanese DVD releases include storyboards for the film and the special edition includes a Ghibli DVD player.[76] *Spirited Away* sold 5.5 million home video units in Japan by 2007,[77] and holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in the country as of 2014[update].[78] The movie was released on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Japan on 14 July 2014, and DVD was also reissued on the same day with a new HD master, alongside several other Studio Ghibli movies.[79][80]\n\n\nIn North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003.[81] The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller.[82] The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and *The Art of Spirited Away*, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden.[83] The movie was released on Blu-ray by and North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 16 June 2015.[84] GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017 following the expiration of Disney's previous deal with Studio Ghibli in the country in North America.[85] On 12 November 2019, GKIDS and Shout! Factory issued a North-America-exclusive *Spirited Away* collector's edition, which includes the film on Blu-ray, and the film's soundtrack on CD, as well as a 40-page book with statements by Toshio Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki, and essays by film critic Kenneth Turan and film historian Leonard Maltin.[86][87] Along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli films, *Spirited Away* was released on digital markets in the United States for the first time, on 17 December 2019.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and VHS as a rental release through independent distributor High Fliers Films PLC following the film's limited theatrical release. It was later officially released on DVD in the UK on 29 March 2004, with the distribution being done by Optimum Releasing themselves.[88] In 2006, the DVD was reissued as a single-disc release (without the second one) with packaging matching other releases in Optimum's \"The Studio Ghibli Collection\" range.[89] The then-renamed StudioCanal UK released the movie on Blu-ray on 24 November 2014, A British 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition, similar to other Studio Ghibli anniversary editions released in the UK, was released on 25 October 2021.[90]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2015 Blu-ray release grossed $9,925,660 from 557,613 physical units sold as of 21 February 2021[update].[91] In the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015,[92] number five in 2016,[93] and number one in 2019.[94]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on 24 January 2003.

Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*, and wrote that Miyazaki's \"movies are as much about moodiness as mood\" and that \"the prospect of animated figures' not being what they seem – either spiritually or physically – heightens the tension.\"[37] Derek Elley of *Variety* said that *Spirited Away* \"can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike\" and praised the animation and music.[100] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* praised Miyazaki's direction and the voice acting, as well as saying that the film is the \"product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before.\"[101] *Orlando Sentinel*'s critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki's direction and said the film is \"the perfect choice for a child who has moved into a new home.\"[102]\n\n\nIn 2004, *Cinefantastique* listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".[103] In 2005, *Spirited Away* was ranked by IGN as the 12th-best animated film of all time.[104] The film is also ranked number 9 of the highest-rated movies of all time on Metacritic, being the highest rated traditionally animated film on the site. The film ranked number 10 in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[105] In 2010, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it as the 13th-best animated film on the site,[106] and in 2012, as the 17th.[107] In 2019, the site considered the film to be #1 among 140 essential animated movies to watch.[108] The film was ranked at number 46 on *Time Out* magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\".[109] The film is listed within the top ten on the British Film Institute's list of \"Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14\".[110] In 2016, it was voted the fourth-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, making it the highest-ranking animated film on the list.[111] In 2017, *The New York Times* ranked it as the second best film of the 21st Century so far.[112] In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked *Spirited Away'*s screenplay the 67th greatest of the 21st century so far.[113] In 2022, the film was ranked number 75 on *Sight & Sound*'s greatest films list, being one of two animated films to make the list (alongside Miyazaki's own *My Neighbor Totoro*).[114][115]\n\n\nIn his book *Otaku*, Hiroki Azuma observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan,\" and cites Miyazaki's win at the Academy Awards for *Spirited Away* among his examples.[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | Animation Kobe | Theatrical Film Award | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 5th Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki | Won\n |\n| 2002\n | 25th Japan Academy Award | Best Film | *Spirited Away* | Won[117] |\n| Best Song\n | Youmi Kimura | Won[117] |\n| 52nd Berlin International Film Festival | Golden Bear | *Spirited Away* | Won[k][118] |\n| Cinekid Festival | Cinekid Film Award\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[l][119] |\n| 21st Hong Kong Film Awards | Best Asian Film\n | *Spirited Away* | Won[120] |\n| Tokyo Anime Award | Animation of the Year\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Best Art Direction\n | Yôji Takeshige [ja] | Won\n |\n| Best Character Design\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Director\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Music\n | Joe Hisaishi | Won\n |\n| Best Screenplay\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Best Voice Actor\n | Rumi Hiiragi as Chihiro\n | Won\n |\n| Notable Entry\n | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| National Board of Review | National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| New York Film Critics Online | Best Animated Feature\n | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 2003\n | 75th Academy Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won[121] |\n| 30th Annie Awards | Annie Award for Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Directing in an Animated Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Writing in a Feature Production | Hayao Miyazaki\n | Won\n |\n| Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production | Joe Hisaishi\n | Won\n |\n| 8th Critics' Choice Awards | Best Animated Feature | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| 29th Saturn Awards | Best Animated Film | *Spirited Away* | Won\n |\n| Saturn Award for Best Writing | Hayao MiyazakiCindy Davis Hewitt (English adaptation)Donald H.

In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki's wide impact to the film industry, he wrote \"The influence of *Spirited Away* can be easily observed in Disney productions like *Brave* and *Frozen*, thanks to John Lasseter's (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences\".[126][127] *Vice* also declared *Spirited Away* to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film \"showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be\" that \"Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later\".[128]\n\n\nFilm director Steven Spielberg said that *Spirited Away* might be \"better than any Disney films\" he has ever seen.[129] Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told *Time* that \"This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time\".[130] The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at *Spirited Away* and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in *Coco*.[131] Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore \"ideas of morality and humanity\" in *Eternals*.[132] *Turning Red*'s director Domee Shi named *Spirited Away* as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Commercial and cultural significance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Time*, *Spirited Away* \"arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works\" but it \"shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world\". Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney \"boosted *Spirited Away*'s visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards\", and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[134] Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film's Oscar win was \"a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years\".[135] Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called *Spirited Away*'s wins at major Western award shows \"a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry\". She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as \"childish, vulgar, things that you didn't take seriously\" but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as \"a real art form\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nA stage adaptation of *Spirited Away* was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli's blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi.[137][138] In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024.[139]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Main Cast\n |\n| --- |\n| Character name\n | Actor (Double Cast)\n |\n| *Chihiro* (千尋)\n | Kanna Hashimoto | Mone Kamishiraishi |\n| *Haku* (ハク)\n | Kotarou Daigo\n | Hiroki Miura |\n| *Kaonashi* (顔無し)\n | Koharu Sugawara | Tomohiko Tsujimoto\n |\n| *Rin* (リン)\n | Miyu Sakihi\n | Fuu Hinami\n |\n| *Kamajī* (釜爺)\n | Tomorowo Taguchi | Satoshi Hashimoto |\n| *Yubāba* (湯婆婆) / *Zenība* (銭婆)\n | Mari Natsuki | Romi Park |\n\n\n### Limited time re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn a limited time release from 11 November to 18 December in 2022,[140][141] the Imperial Theater performance of the play was available for rental in Japan in several streaming services such as Abema, Amazon Prime Video Japan, Docomo Anime Store, FOD, Hulu Japan and U-Next.[142]\n\n\nThere were 2 versions of the play available for rental:\n\n\n\n* **Stage \"Spirited Away\" (Chihiro role: Kanna Hashimoto) ≪Imperial Theater performance version≫ (First distribution)**.

The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD) and includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (*kami*) of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. The term *mononoke* (物の怪, or もののけ) is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.\n\n\nThe film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, by Toho, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. This was the first Studio Ghibli film in the United States to be rated PG-13 by the MPA. It was a critical and commercial blockbuster, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's *Spirited Away*, another Miyazaki film. It was dubbed into English with a script by Neil Gaiman and initially distributed in North America by Miramax, where it sold well on home media despite not performing strongly at the box office.[2] The film greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curse him before its death. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes him pain and will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\n\n\nHeading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant Night Walker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gun shot. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then manages to rescue two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the Great Forest Spirit.\n\n\nAshitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for outcasts and lepers employed to process iron and create firearms, such as hand cannons and matchlock muskets. Ashitaka learns that the town was built by clearcutting forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano, a local daimyō, and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into the demon that attacked Ashitaka's village. She also reveals that San, dubbed Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves and hates humankind.\n\n\nSan infiltrates Iron Town to kill Eboshi. Ashitaka intervenes and subdues Eboshi and San while they are in combat. Amidst the hysteria he is shot by a villager, but the curse gives him strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo. Eboshi intends to give the god's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality) in return for protection from Lord Asano, while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.\n\n\nAshitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano's samurai. The boar clan has been annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo's men trick Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka saves San while the Forest Spirit euthanizes Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Night Walker Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while the Forest Spirit's body bleeds ooze that spreads over the land and kills anything it touches. The forest and its spirits begin to die. Moro's head briefly comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives. Enraged, San attempts to kill Eboshi, but is stopped by Ashitaka, who consoles her and encourages her not to give up.\n\n\nAfter Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing it and lifting Ashitaka's curse. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi vows to build a better town and the forest begins to regrow.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Novelist Ali Shaw has described Yakul as being more similar to a red Lechwe than an elk. Miyazaki called Ashitaka a \"melancholic boy who has a fate\" and stated that Ashitaka's curse \"is similar to the lives of people [at the time]\".[5] Ashitaka's English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as \"an unexpected hero. He's not your usual wild, brave guy. He's really just a young, earnest man who's trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village.\"\n* Yuriko Ishida voices San (サン), a young woman who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans, but eventually comes to care for Ashitaka. In the English version, San is voiced by Claire Danes.\n\t+ Ishida also voices Kaya (カヤ), Ashitaka's bride-elect who breaks the rules of the village to gift him her dagger to remember her by.[6] Tara Strong provides her voice in the English version, where she is referred to as his younger sister due to the translation.\n* Yūko Tanaka provides the voice of Lady Eboshi (エボシ御前, *Eboshi Gozen*), the ruler of Irontown who continually clears the forest. Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film.[5] Miyazaki said that Eboshi has a strong and secure personality, evident in the fact that she let Ashitaka move freely through the settlement unescorted, despite his unclear motives. He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperor's authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she would not hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams. Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a shirabyōshi.[7] Eboshi's English voice actress Minnie Driver stated that she was interested in \"the challenge of playing [a] woman who supports industry and represents the interests of man, in terms of achievement and greed.\" Driver viewed Eboshi as \"a warrior, an innovator and a protector.\"\n* Kaoru Kobayashi provides the voice of Jiko-bō (ジコ坊, called \"Jigo\" in the English version), a monk and mercenary who befriends Ashitaka on his journey to the west. Miyazaki was unsure whether to make Jiko-bō a government spy, a ninja, a member of a religious group or \"a very good guy.\" He eventually decided to give him elements of all of the above groups.[5] In the English version, Jigo is voiced by Billy Bob Thornton.\n* Masahiko Nishimura voices Kohroku (甲六, *Kōroku*), an ox driver; John DeMita voices Kohroku in the English version. Miyazaki wrote Kohroku to be \"an ordinary guy [who] didn't do anything heroic, right to the end\", something he stated was contrary to films he had made up to that point.[5]\n* Tsunehiko Kamijō provides the voice of Gonza (ゴンザ), Eboshi's short-tempered but loyal bodyguard; he is voiced by John DiMaggio in the English version.\n* Akihiro Miwa voices Moro (モロの君, *Moro no Kimi*), a giant wolf god and San's adopted mother; Gillian Anderson provides her voice in the English version.\n* Mitsuko Mori provides the voice of Hii-sama (ヒイ様), the wise woman of Ashitaka's village. In the English version, Hii-sama is voiced by Debi Derryberry.\n* Hisaya Morishige provides the voice of Okkoto-nushi (乙事主, called \"Okkoto\" in the English version), a blind boar god. In the English version, Okkoto is voiced by Keith David, who also voices the narrator in the film's opening sequence.\n\n\nThe cast also includes:\n\n\n\n* Akira Nagoya as the cattleman leader (牛飼いの長, *Ushikai no Osa*);\n* Kimihiro Reizei as a Jibashiri (ジバシリ);\n* Tetsu Watanabe as a mountain wolf (山犬, *Yamainu*);\n* Makoto Sato as Nago (ナゴの守, *Nago no Mori*), a wild boar turned into a demon who curses Ashitaka when he attacks the Emishi village, voiced by John DiMaggio in the English version;\n* and Sumi Shimamoto as Toki (トキ), Kohroku's wife, a former prostitute, and the leader of Eboshi's women, voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith in the English version.\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Some of the film's natural scenery was inspired by Miyazaki's visit to the forests of Yakushima.[8]\nIn the late 1970s, Miyazaki drew sketches of a film about a princess living in the woods with a beast.[9] Miyazaki began writing the film's plotline and drew the initial storyboards for the film in August 1994.[10][11] He had difficulties adapting his early ideas and visualisations, because elements had already been used in *My Neighbor Totoro* and because of societal changes since the creation of the original sketches and image boards. This writer's block prompted him to accept a request for the creation of the *On Your Mark* promotional music video for the Chage and Aska song of the same title. According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of *Princess Mononoke*. In April 1995, supervising animator Masashi Ando devised the character designs from Miyazaki's storyboard. In May 1995, Miyazaki and Ando went to the ancient forests of Yakushima, of Kyushu, an inspiration for the landscape of *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, and the mountains of Shirakami-Sanchi in northern Honshu[12][13] for location scouting along with a group of art directors, background artists and digital animators for three days.[10] Animation production commenced in July 1995.[11] Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000 cels in the film,[14][15] and is estimated to have retouched parts of 80,000 of them.[16] The final storyboards of the film's ending were finished only months before the Japanese premiere date.[17]\n\n\nInspired by John Ford, an Irish-American director best known for his Westerns, Miyazaki created Irontown as a \"tight-knit frontier town\" and populated it with \"characters from outcast groups and oppressed minorities who rarely, if ever, appear in Japanese films.\" He made the characters \"yearning, ambitious and tough.\"[18][*non-primary source needed*] Miyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of Medieval Japan, and wanted to \"portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization.\"[19][*non-primary source needed*] Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of *Princess Mononoke* depicts a \"symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races (the Jomon, Yamato and Emishi).\"[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)3D rendering was used to create writhing demon flesh and composite it onto a hand-drawn Ashitaka.\n*Princess Mononoke* was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million).[21][22][23][*better source needed*] It was mostly hand-drawn, but incorporates some use of computer animation in approximately ten percent of the film.[24] The computer-animated parts are designed to blend in and support the traditional cel animation, and are mainly used in images consisting of a mixture of computer-generated graphics and traditional drawing. A further 10 minutes uses digital ink and paint, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films.[25] Telecom Animation Film Company and Oh! Production helped animate the film. Toei Animation and DR Movie helped with the painting process.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTwo titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as *Princess Mononoke*. The other title can be translated into English as *The Legend of Ashitaka* (アシタカ𦻙記, *Ashitaka Sekki*), and it contains an uncommon kanji 𦻙 that represents \"a legend passed down from ear to ear without being recorded in official history\", according to Miyazaki. In a Tokyo Broadcasting System program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Miyazaki had preferred *The Legend of Ashitaka* as the title while Suzuki himself favoured *Princess Mononoke*, though the former title was eventually reused for the first song on the soundtrack.[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"Princess Mononoke\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nA central theme of *Princess Mononoke* is the environment.[28] The film centers on the adventure of Ashitaka as he journeys to the west to undo a fatal curse inflicted upon him by Nago, a boar turned into a demon by Eboshi.[29] Michelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film \"makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters\". In the case of the deer god's destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the \"supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources\".[30] They also characterized Eboshi as a businesswoman who has a desire to make money at the expense of the forest, and also cite Eboshi's intention to destroy the forest to mine the mountain \"embodies environmentalist evil\".[29] Deirdre M. Pike writes that Princess Mononoke is simultaneously part of nature and part of the problem.[31] Mononoke represents the connection between the environment and humans, but also demonstrates that there is an imbalance in power between the two.[31]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality and disability[edit]\n\n\nTwo other themes found in the plot of *Princess Mononoke* are sexuality and disability. Speaking at the International Symposium on Leprosy / Hansen's Disease History in Tokyo, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, \"said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma\", after visiting the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium near his home in Tokyo.[32] Lady Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to \"cure [her] poor lepers\".[33] Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the University of Wyoming, and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that \"embraces modern social systems, such as industrialization, gendered division of labor, institutionalization of people with diseases, and militarization of men and women.\" They likened Lady Eboshi to a monarch.[34] Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshi's disregard of ancient laws and curses towards sex workers and lepers was enlightenment reasoning and her exploitation of disabled people furthered her modernist viewpoints.[35] Kim and Jarman conclude that Lady Eboshi's supposed benevolence in incorporating lepers and sex workers into her society leverages the social stigma attached to marginalized groups, pointing out that the hierarchical structures within Irontown still support the stigmatization of lepers and sex workers.[36]\n\n\n\n### Development versus preservation[edit]\n\n\nAn additional theme is the morally ambiguous conflict between humankind's growth and development and Nature's need for preservation. According to the *Chicago Sun-Times*'s Roger Ebert, \"It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.\"[37] Billy Crudup, who provided the English voice for Ashitaka, said \"The movie was such an entirely different experience; it had a whole new sensibility I had never seen in animation. It also had something profound to say: that there has to be a give and take between man and nature. One of the things that really impressed me is that Miyazaki shows life in all its multi-faceted complexity, without the traditional perfect heroes and wicked villains. Even Lady Eboshi, who Ashitaka respects, is not so much evil as short-sighted.\" Minnie Driver, the English voice actress for Lady Eboshi, commented similarly: \"It's one of the most remarkable things about the film: Miyazaki gives a complete argument for both sides of the battle between technological achievement and our spiritual roots in the forest. He shows that good and evil, violence and peace exist in us all. It's all about how you harmonize it all.\"[*citation needed*] Anime historian Susan J. Napier said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in *Princess Mononoke*, unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple points of view the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.[38]\n\n\n\n### Loss of innocence[edit]\n\n\nDan Jolin of *Empire* said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, *Porco Rosso*, and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as *Kiki's Delivery Service*, where he has been quoted as saying \"It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we're happy?\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Duality[edit]\n\n\nDuality is central to Eboshi's characterization. Benjamin Thevenin, Assistant Professor of Theater and Media Arts at Brigham Young University, said Eboshi does not fully understand the harm she does to the spirits. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a haven for former sex workers and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontown's inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to help her own people. Thevenin concluded that although Eboshi can be seen as the film's villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general.[40]\n\n\n\n### Non-duality[edit]\n\n\nAt first glance Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke suggest a very dualistic and dichotomous view of life. Lady Eboshi works for the survival of humankind and San for the survival of nature. But Miyazaki, through the character of Ashitaka, argues that we should accept a non-dualistic view of living, accepting that nature and humans coexist. Ashitaka acts as a healer, mediating between humanity and nature. Ashitaka's curse, obtained while defending his people from a demonized boar god, ultimately symbolizes the destructive force of life, forcing him to recognize the commonalities present in the conflict between industrialized society and nature. Ashitaka’s quest for a cure by the Great Forest Spirit symbolizes humanity’s quest to find a way to live on earth that accepts the interbeing of all of earth's creatures. Ashitaka takes responsibility for the preservation and restoration of nature when he returns the Great Forest Spirit’s head, transferring the guardianship of nature from the now dead Great Forest Spirit to humanity. With guardianship of nature delegated to humanity, the dichotomy between humanity and nature is dismantled and the two forces are tasked with recognizing their coexistence.[41]\n\n\n\n### Individualism and conformity[edit]\n\n\nAnother theme in this film is between individualism and societal conformity. According to University of Bristol professors Christos Ellinas, Neil Allan and Anders Johansson, this struggle can be seen between San, a strong individualistic force, and Eboshi, the leader of a great society. San has fully committed to living with the wolves in the forest and to renouncing her association with the human race. Eboshi has vowed to sustain her society of Irontown by any means including destroying the environment. The people of Irontown have a cohesive ideology and agree with Eboshi to protect Irontown at the cost of the environment's destruction. This conformity can be found within their society, because \"even though there is an envisioned culture which an organization abides to, achieving coherence at lower aggregation levels (e.g. individuals) is increasingly challenging due to its emergent nature\".[42]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997.[43] The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both anime fans and arthouse moviegoers in English-speaking countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSince Walt Disney Studios had made a distribution deal with Tokuma Shoten for Studio Ghibli's films in 1996, it was the first film from Studio Ghibli along with *Kiki's Delivery Service* and *Castle in the Sky* to have been dubbed into English by Disney; in this case, subsidiary Miramax Films was assigned to release the movie in the US on October 29, 1999.[*citation needed*] In response to demands from Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein to edit the film, Toshio Suzuki sent Weinstein a samurai sword with the message: \"No cuts.\"[44][45] Promotion manager Steve Alpert revealed that Weinstein had wanted to trim the film down from 135 minutes to 90 minutes \"despite having promised not to do so.\" When Alpert informed him that Miyazaki would not agree to these demands, Weinstein flew into one of his infamous rages and threatened Alpert that he would \"never work in this...industry again\".[45]\n\n\nWeinstein hired Neil Gaiman to write the English script, and he chose to simplify some of the Japanese terminology for this dub, with words like *Jibarashi* becoming \"Mercenary\" and *Shishigami* becoming \"Forest Spirit\". According to him at one of the American screenings of the dub, the release was somewhat delayed because the original recordings deviated from the English script as written.[*citation needed*] Despite Gaiman's independent fame as an author, his role as scriptwriter for the dub was not heavily promoted: Studio Ghibli requested that Miramax remove some executives' names from the poster for the film, but the executives (Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein, and Scott Martin) decided that Gaiman's name was contractually expendable.[46]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2000, the English-dub version of *Princess Mononoke* was released theatrically in Japan along with the documentary *Mononoke hime in U.S.A.*[43] The documentary was directed by Toshikazu Sato and featured Miyazaki visiting the Walt Disney Studios and various film festivals.[47] The film had a limited theatrical re-release in the United States during July 2018,[48] and again during April 2022 for the 25th anniversary of its original Japanese release.[49]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* was the highest-grossing Japanese film of 1997, earning ¥11.3 billion in distribution rental earnings.[50] It became the highest-grossing film in Japan, beating the record set by *E.T.* in 1982, but was surpassed several months later by *Titanic*.[51] The film earned total domestic gross receipts of ¥20.18 billion.[52]\n\n\nIt was the top-grossing anime film in the United States in January 2001, but because its US release was only in select theaters, the film did not fare as well financially in the country when released in October 1999. It grossed $2,298,191 for the first eight weeks.[53][48] It showed more strength internationally, where it earned a total of $11 million outside Japan, bringing its worldwide total to $159,375,308 at the time.[48] On December 6, 2016, GKIDS announced that it would screen the film in US cinemas on January 5 and January 9, 2017, to celebrate its 20th anniversary,[54] bundled with the *On Your Mark* short.[55] The film's limited US re-release in 2018 grossed $1,423,877 over five days, bringing its US total to $3,799,185 and worldwide total to $160,799,185.[48] As of 2020[update], the film has grossed $194.3 million.[1]\n\n\nFor its 25th anniversary, Princess Mononoke was screened in 35mm at New York City's Japan Society on July 22, 2022.[56]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the film was released on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on June 26, 1998. A LaserDisc edition was also released by Tokuma Japan Communications on the same day. The film was released on DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on November 21, 2001, with bonus extras added, including the international versions of the film as well as the storyboards.[*citation needed*] By 2007, *Princess Mononoke* sold 4.4 million DVD units in Japan.[57]\n\n\nIn July 2000, Buena Vista Home Entertainment via Miramax Home Entertainment announced plans to release the film on VHS and DVD in North America on August 29.[58] Initially, the DVD version of *Princess Mononoke* wasn't going to include the Japanese-language track at the request of Buena Vista's Japan division. Because the film hadn't been released on DVD in Japan yet, there were concerns that \"a foreign-released DVD containing the Japanese language track will allow for the importation of such a DVD to Japan, which could seriously hurt the local sales of a future release of the [film]\".[59] The fansite Nausicaa.net organized an email campaign for fans to include the Japanese language track,[59] while DVD Talk began an online petition to retain the Japanese language track.[60] The DVD release of *Princess Mononoke* was delayed as a result.[61] Miramax Home Entertainment released the DVD on December 19, 2000 with the original Japanese audio, the English dubbed audio and extras including a trailer and a documentary with interviews from the English dub voice actors.[62] The film was released on Blu-ray disc in Japan on December 4, 2013.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Princess Mononoke* on Blu-ray Disc on November 18, 2014.[*citation needed*] In its first week, it sold 21,860 units; by November 23, 2014, it had grossed $502,332.[63] It was later included in Disney's \"The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki\" Blu-ray set, released on November 17, 2015.[64] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[65] As of October 2020[update], the film has grossed $9,232,906 from Blu-ray sales in the United States.[63]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015 (below five other Studio Ghibli anime films),[66] number ten in 2016,[67] number five in 2018 (below four other Japanese films),[68] and number three in 2019 (below *Spirited Away* and *My Neighbor Totoro*).[69]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on January 22, 1999. It was NTV's second-most-watched film at the time with a 35.1% audience rating, below *Spirited Away*.[70]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 117 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads, \"With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, *Princess Mononoke* is a landmark in the world of animation.\"[71] On Metacritic, it has an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indictating \"generally favorable reviews\".[72]\n\n\n*The Daily Yomiuri*'s Aaron Gerow called the film a \"powerful compilation of Miyazaki's world, a cumulative statement of his moral and filmic concerns.\"[73] Leonard Klady of *Variety* said that *Princess Mononoke* \"is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script\" and the film \"has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema's most grand canvases\".[74] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called *Princess Mononoke* \"a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year. […] You won't find many Hollywood love stories (animated or otherwise) so philosophical.\"[75] Ty Burr of *Entertainment Weekly* called the film \"a windswept pinnacle of its art\" and that it \"has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story\".[76] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* said that the film \"brings a very different sensibility to animation, a medium [Miyazaki] views as completely suitable for straight dramatic narrative and serious themes.\"[77] In his review, Dave Smith from *Gamers' Republic* called it \"one of the greatest animated films ever created, and easily one of the best films of 1999.\"[78]\n\n\nRoger Ebert placed *Princess Mononoke* sixth on his top ten movies of 1999.[79] In 2001, the Japanese magazine *Animage* ranked *Princess Mononoke* 47th in their list of *100 Best Anime Productions of All Time*.[80] It ranked 488th on *Empire*'s list of the 500 greatest films.[81] Time Out ranked the film 26th on 50 greatest animated films.[82] It also ranked 26 on *Total Film'*s list of 50 greatest animated films.[83]\n\n\nJames Cameron cited *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on his 2009 film *Avatar*. He acknowledged that it shares themes with *Princess Mononoke*, including its clash between cultures and civilizations, and cited *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[84]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is the first animated feature film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Best Picture.[85] For the 70th Academy Awards ceremony, *Princess Mononoke* was the Japanese submission to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not successfully nominated.[86] Hayao Miyazaki was also nominated for an Annie Award for his work on the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | 52nd Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film | *Princess Mononoke* | Won\n | [87] |\n| Best Animation Film | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| Japanese Movie Fans' Choice\n | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| 10th Nikkan Sports Film Awards | Best Director | Hayao Miyazaki\n | [*citation needed*] |\n| Yūjirō Ishihara Award | *Princess Mononoke* |\n| 1st Japan Media Arts Festival | Grand Prize\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 1998\n | 21st Japan Academy Awards | Picture of the Year | *Princess Mononoke* | [85] |\n| 40th Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 22nd Hochi Film Awards | Special Award\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 2000\n | 28th Annie Awards | Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Feature Production\n | Hayao Miyazaki  (English language version)\n | Nominated\n | [88] |\n| 4th Golden Satellite Awards | Best Animated or Mixed Media Film\n | *Princess Mononoke* | [*citation needed*] |\n| 2001\n | 27th Saturn Awards | Best Home Video Release\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Won\n | [*citation needed*] |\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The music was performed by Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Hiroshi Kumagai. The soundtrack was released in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications on July 2, 1997, and the North American version was released by Milan Records on October 12, 1999.\n\n\nThe titular theme song was performed by counter-tenor Yoshikazu Mera. For the English adaptation, Sasha Lazard sang the song.\nDuring the movie Hisaishi makes use of a few known classical pieces and quotes them, such as Dmitri Shostakovich's 5th symphony.\nAs with other Studio Ghibli films, additional albums featuring soundtrack themes in alternative versions have been released. The image album features early versions of the themes, recorded at the beginning of the film production process, and used as source of inspiration for the various artists involved. The symphonic suite features longer compositions, each encompassing several of the movie themes, performed by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mario Klemens.\n\n\n\n## Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that Studio Ghibli and British theatre company Whole Hog Theatre would be bringing *Princess Mononoke* to the stage. It is the first stage adaptation of a Studio Ghibli work.[89] The contact between Whole Hog Theatre and Studio Ghibli was facilitated by Nick Park of Aardman Animations after he sent footage of Whole Hog performances to Studio Ghibli's Toshio Suzuki.[90] The play features large puppets made out of recycled and reclaimed materials.[91]\n\n\nThe first performances were scheduled for London's New Diorama Theatre and sold out in 72 hours, a year in advance.[92][93] In March 2013, it was announced that the show would transfer to Japan after its first run of shows in London. A second series of performances followed in London after the return from Tokyo. The second run of London performances sold out in four and half hours.[94][95] The play received positive reviews and was one of Lyn Gardner's theatre picks in *The Guardian*.[96][97][98][99][100] On April 27, 2013, the play was presented at Nico Nico Douga's Cho Party and was streamed online in Japan.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Loo, Egan (December 15, 2020). \"Spirited Away, 3 Other Ghibli Films' Box Office Totals Rose Due to This Year's Revival Screenings\". *Anime News Network*.

She calls him \"Anisama (older brother)\", but it just means that he is an older boy in her clan.  \n**Q:** So they are not real brother and sister.  \n**M:** If they were, that wouldn't be interesting at all. There used to be a lot of marriage among blood relations in Japan. I thought of Kaya as a girl who is determined to do so (marry Ashitaka). But Ashitaka chose San. It's not strange at all to live with San, who lives with such a brutal fate. That's life.`{{cite web}}`: CS1 maint: others (link)\n7. **^** Leavey, John (2010). \"Possessed by and of: Up against Seeing: Princess Mononoke\". *ImageTexT*. **5** (2). University of Florida.

Many are perfect the way they are. That that makes me very gratified. My job is to maintain overall, in every cel, a standard that I have set for the film.

It stars the voices of Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto and Hitoshi Takagi, and focuses on two young sisters and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.\n\n\nIn 1989, Streamline Pictures produced an English-language dub for exclusive use on transpacific flights of Japan Airlines. Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film. This dub was released in 1993 to United States theaters, and the following year on VHS and LaserDisc in the US by Fox Video in 1994, and on DVD in 2002. The rights to this dub expired in 2004, so Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the film on March 7, 2006 with a new dub cast.[1] This DVD release is the first version of the film in the US to include both Japanese and English language tracks.\n\n\nThe film explores themes such as animism, Shinto symbology, environmentalism and the joys of rural living. *My Neighbor Totoro* received worldwide critical acclaim, and has grossed over $41 million worldwide at the box office as of September 2019; the film also grossed significantly more from home video sales and merchandise.\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* received numerous awards, including the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, the Mainichi Film Award, and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the Blue Ribbon Awards in the same year. The film is considered as one of the top animation films, ranking 41st in *Empire* magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010 and the number-one animated film on the 2012 *Sight & Sound* critics' poll of all-time greatest films.[2][3] The film and its titular character have become cultural icons, and made multiple cameo appearances in other films. Totoro also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called *susuwatari*, that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.[note 1] The *susuwatari* leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book *Three Billy Goats Gruff*. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSatsuki and Mei's house [ja] at the Expo 2005 site\n![](image)\nCloseup view of Satsuki and Mei's house\n\nThe girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\n\n\nThe girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.\n\n\nEventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nAnimism is a major theme in *My Neighbor Totoro*, according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.[4] Totoro has animistic traits and has *kami* status because he lives in a camphor tree in a Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope, and he is referred to as *mori no nushi* (master of the forest).[4] Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a *kami*.[4] According to Phillip E. Wegner, the film is an example of alternative history, citing the utopian-like setting of the anime.[5]\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Japanese voice actor[6]: 175 | English voice actor(Tokuma/Streamline/50th Street Films, 1989/1993)[7] | English voice actor(Walt Disney Home Entertainment, 2005)[7] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Satsuki Kusakabe (草壁 サツキ) (10-year-old daughter) | Noriko Hidaka | Lisa Michelson | Dakota Fanning |\n| Mei Kusakabe (草壁 メイ) (4-year-old daughter) | Chika Sakamoto | Cheryl Chase | Elle Fanning |\n| Tatsuo Kusakabe (草壁 タツオ) (father) | Shigesato Itoi | Greg Snegoff | Tim Daly |\n| Yasuko Kusakabe (草壁 靖子) (mother) | Sumi Shimamoto | Alexandra Kenworthy | Lea Salonga |\n| Totoro (トトロ) | Hitoshi Takagi | — | Frank Welker |\n| Kanta Ōgaki (大垣 勘太) (a local boy) | Toshiyuki Amagasa | Kenneth Hartman | Paul Butcher |\n| Granny (祖母) (Nanny in the 1993 dub) | Tanie Kitabayashi | Natalie Core | Pat Carroll |\n| Catbus (ネコバス, **Nekobasu**) | Naoki Tatsuta | Carl Macek (uncredited) | Frank Welker |\n| Michiko (ミチ子) | Chie Kōjiro | Brianne Siddall (uncredited) | Ashley Rose Orr\n |\n| Mrs. Ogaki (Kanta's mother) | Hiroko Maruyama | Melanie MacQueen | Kath Soucie |\n| Mr. Ogaki (Kanta's father) | Masashi Hirose | Steve Kramer | David Midthunder\n |\n| Old Farmer | — | Peter Renaday |\n| Miss Hara (Satsuki's teacher) | Machiko Washio | Edie Mirman (uncredited) | Tress MacNeille (uncredited)\n |\n| Kanta's Aunt | Reiko Suzuki | Russi Taylor |\n| Otoko | Daiki Nakamura | Kerrigan Mahan (uncredited) | Matt Adler |\n| Ryōko | Yūko Mizutani | Lara Cody | Bridget Hoffman |\n| Bus Attendant | — | Kath Soucie |\n| Mailman | Tomomichi Nishimura | Doug Stone (uncredited) | Robert Clotworthy |\n| Moving Man | Shigeru Chiba | Greg Snegoff | Newell Alexander\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nAfter working on *3000 Miles in Search of a Mother*, Miyazaki wanted to make a \"delightful, wonderful film\" that would be set in Japan with the idea to \"entertain and touch its viewers, but stay with them long after they have left the theaters\".[6] Initially, Miyazaki had the main characters Totoro, Mei, Tatsuo, and Kanta.[6]: 8 The director based Mei on his niece,[8] and Totoros as \"serene, carefree creatures\" that were \"supposedly the forest keeper, but that's only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation\".[6]: 5, 103\n\n\nArt director Kazuo Oga was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a *satoyama*. Miyazaki challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with *My Neighbor Totoro* began Oga's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the film's color palette; Oga wanted to paint black soil from Akita Prefecture and Miyazaki preferred the color of red soil from Kantō region.[6]: 82 The finished film was described by Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki; \"It was nature painted with translucent colors\".[9]\n\n\nOga's conscientious approach to *My Neighbor Totoro* was a style the *International Herald Tribune* recognized as \"[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive\". The newspaper said of the film:\n\n\n\n\n> Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this sense comes from Oga's evocative backgrounds, which give each tree, hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems ready to spring into sentient life.[10]\n> \n> \n\n\nOga's work on *My Neighbor Totoro* led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli, which assigned him jobs that would play to his strengths, and Oga's style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.[10]\n\n\nOnly one young girl, rather than two sisters, is depicted in several of Miyazaki's initial conceptual watercolor paintings, as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home-video releases. According to Miyazaki; \"If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldn't be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult.\"[6]: 11 Miyazaki said the film's opening sequence was not storyboarded; \"The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets ...\"[6]: 27 The ending sequence depicts the mother's return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.[6]: 149\n\n\nMiyazaki stated that the story was initially intended to be set in 1955, however, the team was not thorough in the research and instead worked on a setting \"in the recent past\".[6]: 33 The film was originally set to be an hour long but during production it grew to respond to the social context, including the reason for the move and the father's occupation.[6]: 54 Eight animators worked on the film, which was completed in eight months.[11]\n\n\nTetsuya Endo noted numerous animation techniques were used in the film. For example, ripples were designed with \"two colors of high-lighting and shading\" and the rain for *My Neighbor Totoro* was \"scratched in the cels\" and superimposed for it to convey a soft feel.[6]: 156 The animators stated one month was taken to create the tadpoles, which included four colors; the water for it was also blurred.[6]: 154\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe music for *My Neighbor Totoro* was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who previously collaborated with Miyazaki on the movies *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* and *Castle in the Sky*. Hisaishi was inspired by the contemporary composers Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and John Cage, and described Miyazaki's films as \"rich and personally compeling\". He hired an orchestra for the soundtrack and primarily used a Fairlight instrument.[6]: 169, 170\n\n\n\nThe soundtrack for *My Neighbor Totoro* was first released in Japan on May 1, 1988, by Tokuma Shoten, and includes the musical score used in the film, except for five vocal pieces that were performed by Azumi Inoue, including \"Stroll\", \"A Lost Child\", and \"My Neighbor Totoro\".[12] It had previously been released as an Image Song CD in 1987 that contains some songs that were not included in the film.[13] \n\n![](image)\n\n\"The Huge Tree in the Tsukamori Forest\"\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

Miyazaki's production paralleled his colleague Isao Takahata's production of *Grave of the Fireflies*. Miyazaki's film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Grave of the Fireflies* were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered \"one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* initially sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution rental income of ¥588 million in 1988. According to image researcher Seiji Kano, by 2005, the film's box-office gross receipts in Japan totalled ¥1.17 billion[16] ($10.6 million).[17] In France, the film has sold 429,822 tickets since 1999.[18] The film has been internationally released several times since 2002.[19] The film has grossed $30,476,708 worldwide since 2002.[20] A *South China Morning Post* article in 2021 reported that the film has grossed more than $41 million in total.[21]\n\n\nThirty years after its original release in Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* received a Chinese theatrical release in December 2018. The delay was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan but many Chinese people had become familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy.[22] In its opening weekend, ending December 16, 2018, *My Neighbor Totoro* grossed $13 million, entering the box-office charts at number two behind Hollywood film *Aquaman* and ahead of Bollywood film *Padman* at number three.[23] By its second weekend, *My Neighbor Totoro* had grossed $20 million in China.[24] As of February 2019, it had grossed $25,798,550 in China.[25]\n\n\n\n### English dubs[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, US-based company Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive English language dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* for use as an in-flight movie on Japan Airlines flights.[26] In April 1993, Troma Films, under its label 50th St. Films, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release.[27] The songs for the Streamline version of *My Neighbor Totoro* were sung by Cassie Byram.[28]\n\n\nIn 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a new English dub of *My Neighbor Totoro* to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of *My Neighbor Totoro* has a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retain the translation as the earlier dub but are sung by Sonya Isaacs.[29] The Disney dub was directed by Rick Dempsey, a Disney executive in charge of the company's dubbing services,[30] and was written by Don and Cindy Hewitt, who had written other dubs for Studio Ghibli.[31]\n\n\nDisney's English-language dub premiered on October 23, 2005; it was screened at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival.[30][32] The cable television network Turner Classic Movies (TCM) held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub on January 2006, as part of the network's tribute to Hayao Miyazaki. TCM aired the dub and the original Japanese film with English subtitles.[33] The Disney version was released on DVD in the United States on March 7, 2006.[34] In Australia, an English dub was also released by Madman Entertainment on March 15, 2006.[35]\n\n\nIn 2023, the film was re-released in 970 United States locations as part of celebrations to mark the 35th anniversary of its first theatrical release,[36] with showings in both Japanese with English subtitles and with the English dub.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nTokuma Shoten released *My Neighbor Totoro* on VHS and LaserDisc in August 1988.[39] Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan (now Walt Disney Japan) reissued the VHS on June 27, 1997, as part of their series *Ghibli ga Ippai*.[40] Disney released the film on Blu-ray in Japan on 2012.[41]\n\n\nAfter the rights to the Streamline dub expired in 2004,[42] Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the movie on DVD on March 7, 2006, with Disney's newly produced English dub and the original Japanese version. The company reissued *My Neighbor Totoro*, as well as *Castle in the Sky*, and *Kiki's Delivery Service*, with updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins, on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of *Ponyo*. *My Neighbor Totoro* was re-released by Disney on Blu-Ray on May 21, 2013. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[43]\n\n\nIn Japan, *My Neighbor Totoro* had sold 3.5 million VHS and DVD units as of April 2012,[44] equivalent to approximately ¥16,100 million ($202 million) at an average retail price of ¥4,600 (¥4,700 on DVD and ¥4,500 on VHS).[45] In the United States, the film sold over 500,000 VHS units by 1996,[46] with the later 2010 DVD release selling a further 3.8 million units and grossing $64.5 million in the United States as of October 2018.[47]\n\n\nIn the UK, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared on the annual lists of ten-best-selling foreign language films on home video for five consecutive years, ranking number seven in 2015,[48] number six in 2016[49] and 2017,[50] number one in 2018,[51] and number two in 2019 below *Spirited Away*.[52]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* received widespread acclaim from film critics.[53][54] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 59 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"*My Neighbor Totoro* is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood.\"[55] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56]\n\n\nIn 2001, Japanese magazine *Animage* ranked *My Neighbor Totoro* 45th in its list of *100 Best Anime Productions of All Time*.[57] *My Neighbor Totoro* was voted the highest-ranking animated film on *Sight & Sound*'s critics' poll of all-time greatest films, and joint 154th overall.[2] In 2022, the magazine ranked the film as the joint-72nd-greatest film overall, being one of two animated films included in the list.[58][59] *My Neighbor Totoro* was ranked third on the list of \"Greatest Japanese Animated Films of All Time\" by film magazine *Kinema Junpo* in 2009, 41st in *Empire magazine's* \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010, second on a similar *Empire* list of best children's films, and number one in the greatest animated films in *Time Out*; a similar list by the editors ranked the film in third place.[3][60][61][62]\n\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of *Chicago Sun-Times* identified *My Neighbor Totoro* as one of his \"Great Movies\", calling it \"one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki\". In his review, Ebert said the film \"is based on experience, situation and exploration—not on conflict and threat\", and added:\n\n\n> \n> it would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls ... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.[63]\n> \n> \n\n\nSteve Rose from *The Guardian* gave the film five stars, praising Miyazaki's \"rich, bright, hand-drawn\" animation and describing it as \"full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence and joyous discovery, all rooted in a carefully detailed reality\".[64] Trevor Johnston from *Time Out* also awarded the film five stars, commenting on its \"delicate rendering of the atmosphere\" and its first half that \"delicately captures both mystery and quietness\".[65] Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited *My Neighbor Totoro* as one of his favorite films.[66] Writing for the *London Evening Standard*, Charlotte O'Sullivan praised the charm of the film but said it lacks complexity in comparison with *Spirited Away*.[67] Jordan Cronk from *Slant* awarded the film three-and-a-half stars but said it is \"devoid of much of the fantasia of Miyazaki's more outwardly visionary work\".[68] In the 1996 movie guide *\"Seen That, Now What?\"*, *My Neighbor Totoro* was given the rating of \"A\". The guide stated that the film is an \"enchanting, lushly animated view of the natural world with child's sense of wonder\", and noting its suitability for young children while being \"a perennial favorite among [film buffs]\".[69]\n\n\nThe 1993 translation was not as well-received as the 2006 translation; Leonard Klady of *Variety* wrote the 1993 translation demonstrates \"adequate television technical craft\" that is characterized by \"muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a] vapid storyline\". Klady described the film's environment as \"obviously aimed at an international audience\" but \"evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating\".[70] Stephen Holden of *The New York Times* described the 1993 translation as \"very visually handsome\", and said the film is \"very charming\" when \"dispensing enchantment\". Despite the highlights, Holden wrote \"too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat\".[71]\n\n\nMatthew Leyland of *Sight & Sound* reviewed the DVD released in 2006, commenting; \"Miyazaki's family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning to end ... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid credibility of the girls' actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings\". Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film but noted the disc lacks a look at the film's production, instead being overabundant with storyboards.[72] Writing in *Joe Hisaishi's Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro*, Kunio Hara praised the soundtrack, describing the song \"My Neighbor Totoro\" as a \"sonic icon\" of the film. Hara also commented the music \"arouse[s] a similar sentiment of yearning for the past\".[39]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Award\n | Category\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | Kinema Junpo Awards | Kinema Junpo Award – Best Film[73] | Won\n |\n| Readers' Choice Award – Best Japanese Film[74] | Won\n |\n| Mainichi Film Awards | Best Film[73] | Won\n |\n| Ōfuji Noburō Award[75] | Won\n |\n| Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award[73] | Won\n |\n| Animage Anime Awards[76] | Grand Prix prize[73] | Won\n |\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n*My Neighbor Totoro* was considered a milestone for writer-director Hayao Miyazaki. The popularity of film's central character Totoro among Japanese children has been likened to that of Winnie-the-Pooh in Britain.[77] *The Independent* said Totoro is one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing the creature; \"At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki's other magical creations\".[78] The *Financial Times* recognized the character's appeal, commenting Totoro \"is more genuinely loved than Mickey Mouse could hope to be in his wildest—not nearly so beautifully illustrated—fantasies\".[77] *Empire* also commented on Totoro's appeal, ranking him at number 18 on a list of the greatest animated characters of all time.[79]\n\n\nThe character of Totoro later became a mascot and official logo for Studio Ghibli.[80][81][82][83]\n\n\nAccording to the environmental journal *Ambio*, *My Neighbor Totoro* \"has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for *satoyama* and traditional village life\". The film's central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese campaign \"Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign\", which aimed to preserve areas of *satoyama* in Saitama Prefecture.[84] The fund, started in 1990 after the film's release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by *My Neighbor Totoro*.[85]\n\n\nMiyazaki additionally uses Totoro as a part of his logo for Studio Ghibli.[1] Totoro also makes a cameo appearance in the Pixar film *Toy Story 3* (2010)[86] but was not included in *Toy Story 4* due to licensing problems.[87] *Toy Story 3*'s art director Daisuke Tsutsumi is married to Miyazaki's niece, who inspired the character Mei in *My Neighbor Totoro*.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Eoperipatus totoro* – a velvet worm from Vietnam\nA main-belt asteroid that was discovered on December 31, 1994, was named 10160 Totoro.[88] In 2013, *Eoperipatus totoro*, a species of velvet worm that was discovered in Vietnam, was named after Totoro. Following the request of the paper's authors, the species was named for the character because he \"uses a many-legged animal as a vehicle, which according to the collectors resembles a velvet worm\".[89]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan in May 1988, Tokuma published a four-volume series of *ani-manga* books, which use color images and lines directly from *My Neighbor Totoro*.[90][91] The series was licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which released the books from November 10, 2004, through February 15, 2005.[92][93][94][95] A 111-page picture book based on the film and aimed at young children was released by Tokuma on June 28, 1988, and, in a 112-page English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[96][97] Tokuma later released another 176-page art book containing conceptual art from the film and interviews with production staff on July 15, 1988, and, in English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[98][99] In 2013, Viz released a hardcover light novel that was written by Tsugiko Kubo and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki.[100]\n\n\n\n### Sequel[edit]\n\n\n***Mei and the Kittenbus*** (めいとこねこバス, **Mei to Konekobasu**) is a thirteen-minute sequel to *My Neighbor Totoro* that was written and directed by Miyazaki.[101] Chika Sakamoto, who voiced Mei in *Totoro*, returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki voiced Granny Cat (*Neko Baa-chan*) and Totoro. The sequel focuses on the character Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her one-night adventures with Kittenbus, the offspring of Catbus, and other cat-oriented vehicles.[102] The sequel was first released in Japan in 2003 and is regularly shown at Ghibli Museum[103] but has not been released on home video.\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nLicensed *My Neighbor Totoro* merchandise of Totoro has been sold in Japan for decades after the film's release. Sales of the film's licensed merchandise in Japan grossed ¥10.97 billion in 1999, ¥56.08 billion during 2003–2007,[104] at least ¥4.1 billion in 2008,[105] and ¥19.96 billion during 2010–2012.[104]\n\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: My Neighbour Totoro (play)\n\nIn May 2022, the Royal Shakespeare Company and composer Joe Hisaishi announced a stage adaptation of the film titled *My Neighbor Totoro* would run from 8 October 2022 to 21 January 2023 at the Barbican Centre, London.[106] It was adapted by British playwright Tom Morton-Smith and directed by Improbable's Phelim McDermott.[107] Tickets went on sale on 19 May 2022, breaking the theater's box-office record for sales in one day that was previously held by the 2015 production of *Hamlet* starring Benedict Cumberbatch.[108] On 30 March 2023, it was announced that the production will return to the Barbican for another season.[109]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Japan, Our Homeland* and *Mai Mai Miracle* (also depicting Japan in the 1950s)\n* Enchanted forest\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The spirits are called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English-dubbed versions.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"My Neighbor Totoro\". *Toronto International Film Festival*.

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi, and distributed by Toho. The film stars Yuria Nara, Hiroki Doi, Tomoko Yamaguchi, Kazushige Nagashima, Yūki Amami, George Tokoro, Rumi Hiiragi, Akiko Yano, Kazuko Yoshiyuki and Tomoko Naraoka. It is the eighth film Miyazaki directed for Studio Ghibli, and his tenth overall. The film tells the story of Ponyo, a goldfish who escapes from the ocean and is helped by a five-year-old human boy, Sōsuke, after she is washed ashore while trapped in a glass jar. As they bond with each other, Ponyo desires to become a human girl, against the devastating circumstances brought about by her acquisition and use of magic.\n\n\nThe film was originally released in Japan on July 19, 2008 by distributor Toho. It was a major commercial success, grossing over $204 million worldwide and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing anime film of all time. It received critical acclaim for its uplifting themes, visual design, and simultaneous appeal towards young children and all audiences.\n\n\nAn English-language version of the film was released on August 14, 2009 to 927 theatres across the U.S., the widest opening for a Studio Ghibli film in the U.S. It was produced by The Kennedy/Marshall Company and released by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nFujimoto, a once-human wizard, lives underwater with his daughter Brunhilde and her numerous smaller sisters. While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. Sōsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving Sōsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.\n\n\nPonyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name, declaring her desire to be a human named Ponyo. She magically begins changing into a human, a power granted to her by Sōsuke's human blood that she licked. Fujimoto forces her back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, resulting in a tsunami. Ponyo goes back to Sōsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. His mother, Lisa, allows her to stay at their house. Lisa leaves after the tsunami subsides to check up on the residents of the nursing home where she works, promising Sōsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.\n\n\nGran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. Sōsuke's father, Kōichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare declares that if Sōsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and the balance of nature will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried, reminds her that if Sōsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.\n\n\nThe next day, Sōsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo's magic, they make Sōsuke's pop pop boat bigger to traverse the waters, seeing marine life from the Late Devonian period and more people on boats. When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep, and the boat slowly reverts back to its original size. Sōsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. As they continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare. Ponyo and Sōsuke encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy on the imbalance of nature, begs him to return Ponyo to him. Despite their attempt to flee, they are captured, and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.\n\n\nSōsuke reunites with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks him if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human; Sōsuke confirms that he does. She then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees, and she is encased in a bubble given to Sōsuke, who is instructed to kiss it to complete Ponyo's transformation, as the balance of nature is restored. The previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice, having decided he can trust Sōsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses Sōsuke, completing her transformation as a human.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character name\n | Japanese voice actor[5] | English voice actor[6] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ponyo (ポニョ) | Yuria Nara | Noah Cyrus |\n| Sōsuke (宗介) | Hiroki Doi | Frankie Jonas |\n| Lisa (リサ, *Risa*) | Tomoko Yamaguchi | Tina Fey |\n| Kōichi (耕一) | Kazushige Nagashima | Matt Damon |\n| Gran Mamare (グランマンマーレ, *Guran Manmāre*) | Yūki Amami | Cate Blanchett |\n| Fujimoto (フジモト) | George Tokoro | Liam Neeson |\n| Young Mother (婦人, *Wakai Hahaoya*) | Rumi Hiiragi | Mona Marshall |\n| Young Father (若い父, *Wakai Chichi*) | Shirō Saitō | Bob Bergen |\n| Ponyo's sisters | Akiko Yano |\n| Toki (トキ) | Kazuko Yoshiyuki | Lily Tomlin |\n| Yoshie (ヨシエ) | Tomoko Naraoka | Betty White |\n| Kayo (カヨ) | Tokie Hidari | Cloris Leachman |\n| Kumiko (クミコ) | Emi Hiraoka | Jennessa Rose\n |\n| Karen (カレン) | Nozomi Ōhashi | Colleen O'Shaughnessey |\n| The Newscaster | Shinichi Hatori | Kurt Knutsson\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The setting for *Ponyo* was inspired by the real-life town of Tomonoura in Japan.\nHayao Miyazaki, the film's director and writer, was prompted to create *Ponyo* after producer Toshio Suzuki suggested he make a film aimed at children, noting the success of *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004).[7] The film would be created from a mixture of real-world and fictional influences, combined with a desire to implement new art and animation approaches developed by other Studio Ghibli staff in a feature-length film.[8] In 2004 and 2005, Miyazaki spent time in Tomonoura, a seaside town in Setonaikai National Park, where he familiarised himself with its community and environment. His experience in Tomonoura established the kind of setting he wanted for his next film.[9][10] During his time there, he read the complete works of Natsume Sōseki. He took particular interest in *The Gate*, a book involving a character named Sōsuke who lived at the bottom of a cliff. This provided him more concrete ideas for characters and settings.[11] Initially, Miyazaki solely considered the concept of a film that would depict a stormy sea with \"waves higher than the house on a hillside\". He later created the character Ponyo, a name he thought of as an onomatopoeia of what \"soft, squishy softness\" feels like when touched.[12] Miyazaki recalled that as a nine-year-old he borrowed a copy of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid\" from his neighbour, and that while he was reading it, he had difficulty accepting its premise that its protagonist did not have a soul.[13]\n\n\nWhen preparing pre-production materials, Miyazaki hit a creative block before visiting the Tate Britain art museum, where he found himself startled by an 1852 painting named *Ophelia* done by English painter John Everett Millais and its attention to detail. He remarked, \"I thought, my work is shoddy compared to those artists. I was just astonished. At that point, it became clear to me. Our animation style could not go on as before.\"[14] At the time Katsuya Kondō, Miyazaki's colleague, had been the animation director of *House Hunting* (2006), a 12-minute short film made for screening at the Ghibli Museum. The short used solid and simple lines, and largely used hand-drawn animation. During the production of the short, Kondō had discussed the possibility of producing a feature-length film like this. Kondō accepted an offer to work on the next Studio Ghibli feature film soon after completing the short, identifying an opportunity to progress the ideas behind *House Hunting* with more consideration to story.[15]\n\n\nProduction of *Ponyo* began in May 2006. Kondō was given the role of animation supervisor, and worked closely with Miyazaki in outlining a set of goals that defined the direction of the project, including the use of traditional animation throughout production.[8] Borrowing from Kondō's experience in animating *House Hunting*, *Ponyo* would use solid and simple lines; in isolating basic animation elements, the film would aim to demonstrate the advantages of hand drawn animation through the depiction of motion that cannot be reproduced in any other medium.[8][15] An example of the simple style is when Miyazaki painted a picture of Ponyo riding on a flock of fish, called \"Ponyo is Here\", which was inspired by him listening to *Ride of the Valkyries* while writing a letter to his staff about going with a more elemental style. This would later become a scene in the film.[16] In normal productions, animating a sailing ship would usually involve drawing one cel and sliding it across the frame, which would fix it in a predefined perspective and direction. Miyazaki, however, wanted the ships that appeared in *Ponyo* to be drawn frame-by-frame.[17] A few previous Studio Ghibli films used computer-generated imagery (CGI), the earliest being *Princess Mononoke* (1997).[18] For the production of *Ponyo* however, the computer graphics section at the studio was closed to prioritize hand-drawn animation.[19]\n\n\nSome elements of the film were inspired by Richard Wagner's opera *Die Walküre*.[20] Ponyo's birth name, Brunhilde, is a deliberate reference to the eldest of the nine legendary Valkyrie and Wagner's Brünnhilde. The music also makes reference to Wagner's opera. The character of Sōsuke is based on Miyazaki's son Gorō Miyazaki when he was five.[21]\n\n\nMiyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to *Ponyo*, but producer Toshio Suzuki convinced him to make *The Wind Rises* instead.[22]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nozomi Ōhashi, January 2009, who also voices Karen in the original Japanese version\n*Ponyo*'s eponymous theme song, \"Gake no Ue no Ponyo\", was released ahead of the film on December 5, 2007, performed by Fujioka Fujimaki (a duo consisting of Takaaki Fujioka and Naoya Fujimaki who are known for their underground band *Marichans* from the 1970s) and eight-year-old Nozomi Ōhashi.[23] It entered the top 100 on the Oricon Weekly Charts on July 14, then rose to 24th on July 21, then 6th on July 28, and after the release of the film it ranked 3rd on August 4.[24] By the end of 2008, it was ranked as the 14th highest selling single on the Oricon Yearly Charts. Ōhashi was also the youngest participant in the 59th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, beating Cute's Mai Hagiwara's record at age 11. Afterward, Ōhashi announced her unit with Fujioka Fujimaki was disbanding.[25]\n\n\nAn English-translated pop version of the theme was recorded by Jonas and Cyrus to tie in with the film's English release. The theme plays over the second half of the English version's closing credits; the first half is a translated version of the theme rather than a remix.[26]\n\n\nThe film score of *Ponyo* was composed by Joe Hisaishi, Miyazaki's regular collaborator. The score album, published on compact disc in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications,[27] in South Korea by Pony Canyon Korea[28] and throughout Europe by Germany-based label Colosseum,[29] received a great deal of press in the West, including positive reviews from several veteran film music reviewers.[27][30]\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\n### Japan[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released by Toho on July 19, 2008, in theatres across Japan on 481 screens—a record for a domestic film.[31][32][33][34] As it had beaten *Pokémon: Giratina & the Sky Warrior* (which had opened on the same day). It grossed ¥10 billion ($91 million) in its first month of release,[35] and a total of ¥15.0 billion ($153.1 million) as of November 9, 2008.[36][37]\n\n\nTokyo Anime Fair chose *Ponyo* as Animation of the Year of 2008, as revealed in a press release by Anime News Network.\n\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n![](image)American poster for *Ponyo*\n*Ponyo* was released in the U.S. and Canada on August 14, 2009 by Walt Disney Pictures and The Kennedy/Marshall Company, opening at a wide release at 927 theaters across America, which is by far the widest release for a Studio Ghibli film ever in the U.S, as compared to other Miyazaki films (*Spirited Away* opened in 26 theaters, *Howl's Moving Castle* opened in 36 theaters, and *Princess Mononoke* opened in 38 theaters).[38]\n\n\nThe film's English dub was directed by John Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Peter Sohn of Pixar and produced by Frank Marshall, Hayao Miyazaki, John Lasseter, Steve Alpert, and Kathleen Kennedy; the English script was written by Melissa Mathison.[39][40]\n\n\nIn July 2009, there were multiple pre-screenings of the film in California. Miyazaki traveled to America to promote this film by speaking at the University of California, Berkeley and the San Diego Comic-Con.[41]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2010, as the first film produced by Ghibli or directed by either Miyazaki or Takahata to be released on Blu-ray in America.[42][43] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017 under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.[44]\n\n\nPonyo was released in Southeast Asia on January 1, 2009.[4]\n\n\nThe film was re-released from March 25 to 28, 2018 for its 10th anniversary.[45]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, it made $3,585,852 on 927 screens, which is a per screen average of $3,868.[2] It also opened at number nine at the United States and Canada box office.[2] The film made a total of $15,743,471 in the United States and Canada and $187,461,411 in other countries for a worldwide total of $203,204,882.[2] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as a DVD/Plush Toy pack, on March 2, 2010.\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Ponyo* received critical acclaim.[b] Rotten Tomatoes compiled 174 reviews and determined that 91% were positive, with an average score of 7.6/10. The critics consensus on the website states, \"While not Miyazaki's best film, *Ponyo* is a visually stunning fairy tale that's a sweetly poetic treat for children and Miyazaki fans of all ages.\"[54] On Metacritic, the film has an weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[55]\n\n\n*The Japan Times* gave the film four out of five stars, praised its simple thematic elements and its visual scheme, and compared the film to Miyazaki's classic animation *My Neighbor Totoro*.[56]\n\n\n*Anime Diet* cited the quality of the translation, noting, \"The story and the core of the film was communicated more than adequately through the professional dub and it did not get in the way of the sheer delight and joy that Miyazaki wanted to convey.\" Citing \"slight pacing problems,\" it gave *Ponyo* a rating of 88%.[57]\n\n\nCritics at the Venice International Film Festival generally had high praise.[58][59] Wendy Ide of *The Times* said *Ponyo* \"is as chaotic and exuberant as a story told by a hyperactive toddler,\" and gave it 4 stars out of 5.[60] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film four out of four stars, stating that, \"There is a word to describe *Ponyo*, and that word is magical. This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched. It's wonderful and never even seems to try: It unfolds fantastically.\"[61]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.
