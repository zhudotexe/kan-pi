It is a World Athletics Platinum Label[3] marathon and one of the six World Marathon Majors.[4] The latest edition of the race took place on 5 March 2023. It is sponsored by Tokyo Metro.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Tokyo Marathon\n\nThe first Tokyo Marathon was held on 18 February 2007. However, years prior to 2007, Tokyo Marathon actually consisted of two marathons - the Tokyo International Marathon which took place on even years, and Tokyo - New York Friendship International Marathon which took place on odd years. In the inaugural year, 1981, both marathons took place. However, because it was not possible to support two marathons a month apart in the same city, from 1982, the alternating format went into effect.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 2007 marathon was also a representative selection race of the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka. The total number of participants was set at 30,000. Of that, 25,000 people signed up for the marathon, and 5,000 signed up for the 10K run.\n\n\nMasakazu Fujiwara became the race's first Japanese male winner at the fourth edition.[5]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Dickson Chumba won in a record time of 2:05:42. This was only the second time a runner ran below 2h06 in Japan, after Tsegaye Kebede in Fukuoka Marathon (December 6, 2009). His runner-up, Tadese Tola did also run below 2:06, in a time of 2:05:57.[6]\n\n\nIn January 2020, rock musician Hyde released the song \"Believing in Myself\" as a single inspired by the event.[7] Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, only elite runners were invited to the 2020 Tokyo Marathon. All other participants were given a deferral to 2021.[8]\n\n\nThe 2021 Tokyo Marathon was postponed to 17 October 2021 due to the pandemic. It was then postponed again to 6 March 2022; the event was still referred to as the 2021 Tokyo Marathon, and there was no 2022 Tokyo Marathon.[9][10][11] Additionally, all overseas runners were barred from competing, with their entries automatically transferred to 2023.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External images |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) Course map of full marathon in 2012[14] |\n| ![image icon](image) Course map of full marathon in 2017[15] |\n\n\n![](image)Start line at Shinjuku in 2019\n![](image)Full marathon finish line in 2012\n### 2007–2016[edit]\n\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Government Building -> Tokyo Imperial Palace -> Hibiya Park (10 km Finish) -> Shinagawa -> Ginza -> Nihonbashi -> Asakusa -> Tsukiji -> Tokyo Big Sight (Full Marathon Finish)\n\n\n\n![](image)Passing Tokyo Tower'Zōjō-ji in 2010\n### 2017–[edit]\n\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Government Building -> Iidabashi -> Nihonbashi (10 km Finish) -> Asakusa -> Koto (Halfway Point) -> Nihonbashi -> Ginza -> Shinagawa -> Hibiya Park -> Tokyo Station (Full Marathon Finish)[16]\n\n\n\n## Registration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Passing Ginza's Wako store in 2008\n### Numbers[edit]\n\n\nWhen registrations closed for the 2015 Tokyo marathon 308,810 people had applied for the full marathon, and 1,014 had applied for the 10 km race. This gave a total number of 309,824 applicants and an oversubscription rate of 11.3 for the marathon.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Full marathon finish line in 2019\nFor the 2019 event, there were 331,211 applicants. 330,271 of the applications were for the full marathon and 940 were for the 10 km race.[18]\n\n\n\n### Elite field[edit]\n\n\nApart from the invited athletes, runners registered with JAAF who satisfy the following requirement can register in the Elite field.[19]\n\n\nIn 2014, the requirements were:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Distance | Men | Women\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Full | 2:23:00 | 2:54:00\n |\n| Half | 1:01:30 | 1:11:00\n |\n| 10 km | 28:10 | 32:10\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Tokyo International Marathon\n* Tokyo International Women's Marathon\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** This was set during the Tokyo Marathon that took place on 6 March 2022, which was postponed from 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is the second largest annual road race in the UK, after the Great North Run in Newcastle. Founded by athletes Chris Brasher and John Disley in 1981, it is typically held in April, although it moved to October for 2020, 2021, and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The largely flat course is set around the River Thames, starting in Blackheath and finishing at The Mall. Hugh Brasher (son of Chris) is the current race director and Nick Bitel its chief executive.\n\n\nThe race has several components: it has a mass race for the public, professional races for men and women long-distance runners, elite level wheelchair races for men and women, plus a 3-mile mini marathon event for under-17 athletes. The mass race is the largest marathon event in the United Kingdom and its third largest running event (after the Great North Run and Great Manchester Run). There is a significant charity running aspect to the marathon, with participants helping to raise over £1 billion since its founding, including £66.4 million at the 2019 London Marathon which was the highest amount for a single-day fund-raising event.[1]\n\n\nSince 2006, the elite race has been part of the World Marathon Majors, which includes six of the world's top level marathon races. The London Marathon has seen the marathon world record broken on seven occasions: Khalid Khannouchi broke the men's record in 2002, while women's records have been broken by Grete Waitz (1983), Ingrid Kristiansen (1985), Paula Radcliffe (2002, 2003, 2005) and Mary Jepkosgei Keitany (2017). The current elite course records are held by Kelvin Kiptum (2:01:25 in 2023) and Paula Radcliffe (2:15:25 in 2003).

The Polytechnic Marathon (also known as the *Poly*) was first held in 1909.[5]\n\n\nThe current London Marathon was founded in 1981 by Olympic champion and journalist Chris Brasher and athlete John Disley.[6][7] Shortly after completing the New York City Marathon in November 1979 Brasher wrote an article for *The Observer* newspaper which began:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> To believe this story you must believe that the human race be one joyous family, working together, laughing together, achieving the impossible. Last Sunday, in one of the most trouble-stricken cities in the world, 11,532 men and women from 40 countries in the world, assisted by over a million black, white and yellow people, laughed, cheered and suffered during the greatest folk festival the world has seen.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe first London Marathon was held on 29 March 1981, more than 20,000 applied to run. 6,747 were accepted and 6,255 crossed the finish line on Constitution Hill. The Marathon's popularity has steadily grown since then. As at 2009, 746,635 people have completed the race since its inception.[6] In 2010, 36,549 people crossed the line, the biggest field since the race began.[9] The first wheelchair marathon race was held in 1983 and the event was credited with reducing the stigma surrounding disabled athletes.[10] In 2013 the IPC Athletics Marathon World Cup was held within the London Marathon featuring athletes of both genders in the T42–T46 and T11–T13 categories.[11] In August 2013 it was announced that the event would be staged in London until 2017 and feature athletes in the T11-T12, T13, T42-T44, T43, T45-46, T51-52 and the T53-54 class.[12]\n\n\nFor many years the London and Polytechnic Marathons competed with each other until, in 1996, the latter folded in due to the popularity of the former.[5]\n\n\nFollowing the Boston Marathon bombing, organisers of the 2013 London Marathon undertook a review of their security arrangements, despite no specific threats against the event.[13] A 30-second silence was held before the start of the marathon to show respect and support to those affected by the tragedy.[14]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nThe race is currently organised by Hugh Brasher, son of Chris, as race director and Nick Bitel as chief executive. Previously David Bedford and Bitel had overseen a period of great change for the race, including amendments to the course in 2005 which saw the cobbled section by the Tower of London replaced with a flat stretch along the Highway.[15]\n\n\nDan Tunstall Pedoe was the medical director of the London Marathon for 25 years between the first one in 1981 until 2005. In 2003, Pedoe was shadowed by Sanjay Sharma from St George's Hospital (University of London) who took over the role in its entirety in 2006.[16] Medical cover is provided by 150 doctors. Also assisting were more than 1,500 volunteers of St. John Ambulance, who organise over 50 first aid posts along the route, and three field hospitals at the finish. St John Ambulance also provide a number of healthcare professions for the event, including nurses, paramedics, ambulances with crews.[17]\n\n\nThe BBC covers the event, devoting rolling coverage for most of the morning. The theme music associated with this coverage, and with the event itself, is called \"Main Titles to The Trap\", composed by Ron Goodwin for the film *The Trap*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Men's Wheelchair competitors at Shooter's Hill, 13 April 2008\nThere are three separate groups of starters: Elite Women, Wheelchair (Men and Women), and Elite Men followed by Mass Race.[18]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Course map.\n![](image)The top three men, Samuel Wanjiru, Tsegay Kebede, and Jaouad Gharib, near the end of the 2009 marathon\nThe marathon is run over a largely flat course around the River Thames, and spans 42.195 kilometres (26.219 mi).[19]\n\n\nThe route has markers at one mile intervals. Although the race publicity (athlete advice, timing charts and so on) is mile-oriented,[20] the individual timing splits that are available to competitors after the event are kilometre-oriented.[21]\n\n\nThe course begins at three separate points: the 'red start' in southern Greenwich Park on Charlton Way, the 'green start' in St John's Park, and the 'blue start' on Shooter's Hill Road.[22] From these points around Blackheath at 35 m (115 ft) above sea level, south of the River Thames, the route heads east through Charlton. The three courses converge after 4.5 km (2.8 miles) in Woolwich, close to the Royal Artillery Barracks.[22][23]\n\n\nAs the runners reach the 10 km mark (6.2-mile), they pass by the Old Royal Naval College and head towards *Cutty Sark* drydocked in Greenwich. Heading next into Deptford and Surrey Quays/Rotherhithe in the Docklands, and out towards Bermondsey, competitors race along Jamaica Road before reaching the half-way point as they cross Tower Bridge. Running east again along The Highway through Wapping, competitors head up towards Limehouse and into Mudchute in the Isle of Dogs via Westferry Road, before heading into Canary Wharf.[22][23]\n\n\nAs the route leads away from Canary Wharf into Poplar, competitors run west down Poplar High Street back towards Limehouse and on through Commercial Road. They then move back onto The Highway, onto Lower and Upper Thames Streets. Heading into the final leg of the race, competitors pass The Tower of London on Tower Hill. In the penultimate mile along The Embankment, the London Eye comes into view, before the athletes turn right into Birdcage Walk to complete the final 352 m (385 yards), catching the sights of Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, and finishing in The Mall alongside St. James's Palace.[22][23] This final section of the route formed part of the 2012 Olympic Marathon Course.\n\n\nSince the first marathon, the course has undergone very few route changes. In the first race, the course took a diversion around Southwark Park before re-joining Jamaica Road on the way to Tower Bridge and was routed through St Katherine Docks past the Tower Hotel, en route to the Tower of London and the cobblestoned stretch of road that in later years was carpeted, to help runners prevent injury on the uneven surface. In 1982, the finishing post was moved from Constitution Hill to Westminster Bridge due to construction works. It remained there for twelve years before moving to its present location at The Mall. In 2005, the route around the Isle of Dogs between 22 and 34 kilometres (14 and 21 mi) was switched from a clockwise to an anti-clockwise direction, and at 35 km (22 miles) the route was diverted to avoid St Katherine Docks and the cobblestoned area near the Tower of London. In 2008, a suspected gas leak at a pub in Wapping diverted the course, but in 2009 the race followed the same path as in 2007.[24][25]\n\n\nSince 2012 mile 21 has become a significant cheer zone with Run Dem Crew transforming the stretch of Commercial Road outside the former Limehouse Town Hall into a street party with music and confetti cannons.[26]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 London Marathon was run on a non-traditional course, consisting of 19.6 laps of length 2.15 kilometres (1.34 mi) around St James's Park, taking in The Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Birdcage Walk and Buckingham Palace. The final circuit was 1,345 metres (0.84 mi) along the Mall, following the finish line of the traditional London Marathon course.[27]\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of winners of the London Marathon\n\n![](image)Paula Radcliffe, women's winner of the 2005 race\nLondon is one of the top six world marathons that form the World Marathon Majors competition with a million prize purse.[28] The inaugural marathon had 7,741 entrants, 6,255 of whom completed the race.[29] The first Men's Elite Race in 1981 was tied between American Dick Beardsley and Norwegian Inge Simonsen, who crossed the finish line holding hands in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 48 seconds.[30] The first Women's Elite Race, also in 1981, was won by Briton Joyce Smith in 2:29:57.[30] In 1983, the first wheelchair races took place. Organized by the British Sports Association for the Disabled (BASD), 19 people competed and 17 finished. Gordon Perry of the United Kingdom won the Men's Wheelchair Race, coming in at 3:20:07, and Denise Smith, also of the UK, won the Women's Wheelchair Race in 4:29:03.[31]\n\n\nWorld records for marathon running have been set several times. Khalid Khannouchi, representing the United States, set the men's world record in 2:05:38 in 2002. The following year, British runner Paula Radcliffe set the women's world record in 2:15:25 (later briefly downgraded to \"world best\" by the IAAF as it was achieved in a mixed race,[32] but restored to the title of \"world Record\" shortly thereafter); in 2017 Mary Keitany of Kenya set a world record of 2:17:01 for an all-women's marathon. Previous women's world records were set in 1983 and 1985 by Grete Waitz and Ingrid Kristiansen respectively, both of Norway. The current men's course record is 2:01:25 set by Kenyan Kelvin Kiptum in 2023. Marcel Hug of Switzerland set the Men's Wheelchair Race course record at 1:26:27 in 2021, and the Women's equivalent was set by Swiss athlete Manuela Schär in 2021, with 1:39:52.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n## Amateur runners[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amateur runners in the race running along Victoria Embankment\nThe race attracts amateur runners who make up the bulk of the thirty thousand or more participants; commonly running in fancy dress for charity causes. In 2002, Lloyd Scott completed the marathon wearing a deep sea diving suit that weighed a total of 110 lb (50 kg), with each shoe weighing 24 lb (11 kg); he also set a record for the slowest London Marathon time.[34] On 19 April 2003, former boxer Michael Watson, who had been told he would never be able to walk again after a fight with Chris Eubank, made headlines by finishing the marathon in six days. In 2006, Sir Steve Redgrave (winner of five consecutive Olympic gold medals) set a new Guinness World Record for money raised through a marathon by collecting £1.8 million in sponsorship. This broke the record set the previous year by the founder of the Oasis Trust, Steve Chalke, who had collected over £1.25 million. In 2011, Chalke raised a new record £2.32 million.[35] The £500 that Claire Squires collected before the race increased to over £1 million after she died having collapsed during the 2012 race.[36]\n\n\nA small number of runners, known as the \"Ever Presents\", have completed each of the London Marathons since 1981. When the list was first established in 1995, there were 42. After 2019, their number has shrunk to 10. At the running of the 2019 event, the oldest runner was 85-year old Kenneth Jones, whilst the youngest runner was 60-year-old Chris Finill. They are all male.[37]\n\n\n\n## Mini Marathon[edit]\n\n\nThe Virgin Money Giving Mini London Marathon is the sister of The London Marathon. The course is the last 3 mi (4.828 km) of the London Marathon and is for u13s, u15s and u17s from all 33 London Boroughs along with 13 teams from ten English regions and three Home Countries: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is also a Mini Wheelchair race on the day.[38] The race doubles as the British Athletics 3mile Championships.\n\n\n\n## BBC live coverage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2019 London Marathon finishers medal\nThe BBC has broadcast live coverage of the London Marathon since its inception in 1981[39] and has broadcast the race in full since 1984. Originally hosted out-of-vision by David Coleman, more recently the main presenters on BBC One have been Sue Barker, Jonathan Edwards and Gabby Logan. The highlight presenters on BBC Two have been Jonathan Edwards (2007–12), Sonali Shah (2013), and Helen Skelton (2014–15). The commentators between for the Marathon on the BBC were David Coleman, Ron Pickering, Brendan Foster, Paul Dickinson, Steve Cram, Andrew Cotter, Stuart Storey, Paula Radcliffe, Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, Liz McColgan and Rob Walker.\n\n\n\n### Theme tune[edit]\n\n\nThe theme tune used by the BBC every year is from the film score of *The Trap*, a 1966 film about a Canadian fur trapper, starring Oliver Reed and Rita Tushingham. The music was written by Ron Goodwin and is performed by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship and marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo used from 2013 to 2021 under Virgin Money sponsorship.\nThe original sponsors of the London Marathon were Gillette, who sponsored the event from 1981 to 1983. Subsequent sponsors have been Mars (1984–1988), ADT (1989–1992), NutraSweet (1993–1995), and Flora (1996–2009).[42][43] Virgin Money sponsored the marathon from 2010, after signing a five-year £17m sponsorship deal in 2008.[44] In April 2013, the London Marathon renewed its sponsorship deal with Virgin Money for a further five years and the race changed its name to the Virgin Money London Marathon.[45][46] In 2021 it was announced that Indian consultancy company Tata Consultancy Services would take over sponsorship of the London Marathon from 2022.[47]\n\n\nA number of other companies and organisations also use the event for brand identification and marketing, including New Balance,[48] Lucozade Sport,[49] and Fuller's Brewery.[50]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* London Triathlon\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 2019 Virgin Money London Marathon smashes world fundraising record[*permanent dead link*].

It is the largest marathon in the world,[3][4] with 53,627 finishers in 2019[5] and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race.[3] Along with the Boston Marathon and Chicago Marathon, it is among the pre-eminent long-distance annual running events in the United States and is one of the World Marathon Majors.\n\n\nThe race is organized by New York Road Runners and has been run every year since 1970, with the exception of 2012, when it was cancelled due to the landfall of Hurricane Sandy, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards. In addition, runners can gain an entry by joining a team to raise funds for one of a number of charities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Paula Radcliffe, the victor of the women's division in the 2007 NYC Marathon.\nSee also: List of winners of the New York City Marathon\n\nThe first New York City Marathon was held 54 years ago on September 13, 1970,[6] organized by Fred Lebow and the then president of New York Road Runners, Vincent Chiappetta,[7][8][*better source needed*] with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. Only 55 runners crossed the finish line.[9]\n\n\nOver the years, the marathon grew larger and larger.[10] To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration became the annual course.\n\n\nDick Traum became the first person to complete a marathon with a prosthetic leg when he finished the 1976 New York City Marathon. The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women's world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times.[9] An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000 and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field.\n\n\nBeginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon's first; the latest date in the marathon season was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979 when the race day of October 21 reached 80 °F (27 °C). The coldest race was in 1995 when the race day of November 12 only reached 43 °F (6 °C), with an intense wind chill.[6]\n\n\nThe New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two million spectators line the course. Before 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC and on Universal Sports for the entire country; however, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. Since 2022, the marathon has also been aired in Spanish via ESPN Deportes.[11] The Marathon can also be watched online.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Initial course[edit]\n\n\nThe race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon.[14] The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park.[15] As per Ted Corbitt, who measured the original course:\n\n\n\n\n> The final measurements of the original New York City Marathon course, Manhattan’s Central Park, were done the evening of September 8, 1970, after work and training day, using the Calibrated Bicycle Method of Measuring. The course consisted of a start-up, out and back loop of 0.79 mile, from W. 67th St. and Central Park West, near the Tavern-on-the-Green Restaurant, up to the 72nd St. and the West Drive intersection and return to the Tavern-on-the Green followed by a loop of 1.695 miles; then four 5.935 mile loops, totaling 26.225 miles (11 yards over distance), ending at the Tavern-on-the Green Restaurant.[16]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Five borough course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Course of the New York City Marathon 2013; this is similar to the courses used in previous years.\nFrom 1976, the course covers all five boroughs of New York City. It begins on Staten Island, in Fort Wadsworth, near the approach to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge typically carries only vehicular traffic and is closed for the event. Runners use both sides of the bridge's upper level and the westbound side of the lower level. In the opening minutes of the race, the bridge is filled with runners, creating a dramatic spectacle that is closely associated with the event.\n\n\nAfter descending the bridge, the course winds through Brooklyn, mostly along Fourth Avenue and Bedford Avenue, for approximately the next 11 miles (18 km). Runners pass through a variety of neighborhoods, including: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Park Slope, Bedford–Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint.\n\n\nAt 13.109 miles (21.097 km), runners cross the Pulaski Bridge, marking the halfway point of the race and the entrance into Long Island City in Queens. After about 15.534 miles (25.000 km) in Queens, runners cross the East River via the lower level of the Queensboro (59th Street) Bridge into Manhattan. At this point in the race, many runners begin to tire, as climbing the bridge is considered one of the most challenging points in the marathon.\n\n\nReaching Manhattan after about 16 miles (26 km), the race proceeds north on First Avenue, then crosses into The Bronx via the Willis Avenue Bridge. The race is only in The Bronx for one mile before returning to Manhattan as the course follows East 138th St. before crossing the Madison Avenue Bridge. It then proceeds south through Harlem down Fifth Avenue and into Central Park at East 90th St. At the southern end of the park, the race proceeds west along 59th St./Central Park South, where thousands of spectators cheer runners on during the last mile. At Columbus Circle, the race reenters the park and finishes beside Tavern on the Green. The time limit for this course is 8+1⁄2 hours from the 10:10 a.m. start.\n\n\n\n### Corrals and timing[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the race initiated a corral system. Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner's bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as \"net time\" (as opposed to \"gun time\").\n\n\nRunners also pass timing mats at 5 km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5 km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20 km, 30 km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded.\n\n\n\n### Different initial routes[edit]\n\n\nAlthough there are three different routes taken through Bay Ridge and up Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, all the routes eventually merge at Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn at Mile 8, and the distance covered by the runners are the same. A runner's bib will have a color (pink, orange, or blue) showing the initial route that they are assigned to, with each color having its own start village and corrals in the staging area.[17]\n\n\n\n## Past marathons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thousands of runners on Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.\n### 1970s[edit]\n\n\n#### 1970[edit]\n\n\nOn September 13, 1970, Gary Muhrcke won the first New York City Marathon held in Central Park in 2:31:38. 127 runners started the race and 55 finished. Nina Kuscsik, the sole woman entrant in the race, dropped out at 15 miles due to illness.\n\n\n\n#### 1972[edit]\n\n\nNina Kuscsik, Pat Barrett, Lynn Blackstone, Liz Franceschini, Cathy Miller, and Jane Muhrke protested the rule of the Amateur Athletic Union that women marathoners had to start their race ten minutes before or after the men, which as implemented by the New York City Marathon in 1972 meant that women had to start running ten minutes before the men.[18][19][20] The women protested by sitting down and waiting ten minutes while holding signs protesting the rule, before starting to run when the men started; they became known as the NYC Six due to their protest.[18][19][20] Ten minutes were added to their times.[18] Kuscsik won the marathon.[20] The ten minutes’ difference requirement was dropped later in 1972.[18][20]\n\n\n\n#### 1974[edit]\n\n\nOn September 29, 1974, Norbert Sander and Kathrine Switzer became the only New York City residents to win the New York City Marathon, Sander winning in 2:26:30 and Switzer the women's division in 3:07:29. Future four-time NYC Marathon champion Bill Rodgers placed fifth in 2:36:00 out of 259 finishers (250 men, 9 women).\n\n\n\n#### 1976[edit]\n\n\nAfter being run in Central Park from 1970 to 1975, this edition of the marathon traversed all five boroughs for the first time. There were 2,090 entrants and 1,549 finishers. Bill Rodgers, who finished 40th in the 1976 Olympic Games marathon in 2:25:14, came back to win the NYC Marathon in a course record 2:10:10. He beat 1976 Olympic marathon silver medalist Frank Shorter who finished second by more than three minutes, Shorter clocking 2:13:12. 41-year-old Miki Gorman was the first woman in 2:39:11, also a course record.\n\n\n\n#### 1977[edit]\n\n\nBill Rodgers and Miki Gorman were the top male and female finishers, as they had been the previous year, Rodgers winning in 2:11:28 and Gorman in 2:43:10.\n\n\n\n#### 1978[edit]\n\n\nBill Rodgers won his third consecutive New York City Marathon in 2:12:12 on a warm day. Grete Waitz, the Norwegian long-distance runner, set a new course record for women at 2:32:30 to win the first of a record nine New York Marathons. The New York Road Runners club annually sponsors \"Grete's Great Gallop,\" a 10 kilometer race around the Central Park loop, in her honor.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### 1979[edit]\n\n\nFor the first time in NYC Marathon history, over 10,000 runners (10,477) completed the race. Bill Rodgers won his fourth and last New York City Marathon on another warm day in 2:11:42, overtaking Kirk Pfeffer who led for the first 23+1⁄2 miles of the race. Grete Waitz again won the women's race with a finish time of 2:27:33, becoming the first woman ever to break 2:30. In a normally trivial mistake, Rosie Ruiz was accidentally given a finish time of 2:56:29. This qualified her for the 1980 Boston Marathon, where she crossed the finish line with a record time of 2:31:56. It was quickly determined that she had not run the entire course in either race, igniting a major scandal. New York Marathon chief Fred Lebow rescinded Ruiz's time after determining she had not finished the 1979 race, and officials in Boston quickly followed suit.[21]\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n#### 1980[edit]\n\n\nAlberto Salazar, an NCAA cross-country champion, won the 1980 New York City Marathon in 2:09:41. At the time this was the fastest marathon debut by an American. His performance was also a course record. He defended his title in 1981 and 1982. Grete Waitz won her third straight NYC Marathon in 2:25:42, also setting the course record in the women's division.\n\n\n\n#### 1981[edit]\n\n\nAlberto Salazar's 2:08:13 was initially considered to be a world's best in the marathon, but the mark was later rescinded by The Athletics Congress (now known as USA Track & Field) when the course was measured to be short by approximately 150 metres (160 yd).[22] Salazar remarked in 1985 that he would continue to believe that he ran a full marathon, since the lack of crowd control forced him to run wide during his turns.[23] He has also suggested that a change in how courses were measured after the 1981 race contributed to the discrepancy in the course length.[22][24]\n\n\n\n#### 1983[edit]\n\n\nEngland's Geoff Smith held a lead through the last half of the race, but was caught at the 26 mile mark in Central Park by 1972 Olympic 1500 metres bronze medalist Rod Dixon from New Zealand, who won by 9 seconds. Dixon had been two and a half minutes behind with 10 km to go. Dixon stood at the finish line celebrating with a collapsed and defeated Smith on the ground behind him.[25]\n\n\n\n#### 1984[edit]\n\n\nOrlando Pizzolato won on a hot day, stopping six times due to heat cramps, but still winning by over a minute in 2:14:53. This was the slowest winning time since 1976 when the New York City Marathon became a world class event. Grete Waitz won her sixth marathon in 2:29:30.\n\n\n\n#### 1985[edit]\n\n\nOrlando Pizzolato and Grete Waitz both repeated their previous year's victories. Pizzolato won in easier fashion than in 1984, in 2:11:34. Waitz took her seventh win in 2:28:06.\n\n\n\n#### 1986[edit]\n\n\nThis year's marathon was held in November (November 2) for the first time and has been ever since. Gianni Poli of Italy won in 2:11:06, the third year in a row that the men's winner was from Italy. Grete Waitz won for the eighth time in 2:28:06.\n\n\n\n#### 1987[edit]\n\n\nIbrahim Hussein of Kenya won the NYC Marathon in 2:11:01, the first man from Africa to do so. Priscilla Welch of Great Britain won in 2:30:17, while eight-time champion Grete Waitz did not compete.\n\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\nSteve Jones of the United Kingdom won, the first British man to do so, in 2:08:20. Grete Waitz won her ninth and last NYC Marathon in 2:28:07.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n#### 1990[edit]\n\n\nDouglas Wakiihuri of Kenya won this year's event in 2:12:39, the second-slowest time since 1976 when the marathon became a world class event. Wanda Panfil of Poland was the top woman in 2:30:45. She is the only woman to date from Poland to win this event. Grete Waitz, attempting to win her 10th NYC Marathon, finished fourth in 2:34:34 and then retired from competitive distance running.\n\n\n\n#### 1992[edit]\n\n\nGrete Waitz completed her last New York Marathon with her friend and race co-founder, Fred Lebow, in celebration of Lebow's 60th birthday. Lebow had been diagnosed with brain cancer and died two years later in 1994. They both completed the race with a time of 5:32:35. Waitz also died of cancer in 2011.\n\n\nThe men's winner of this year's marathon was Willie Mtolo of South Africa in 2:09:29. Lisa Ondieki of Australia was the women's winner in 2:24:40, a course record that would last for nine years.\n\n\n\n#### 1994[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1994 event, Germán Silva recovered from a wrong turn seven-tenths of a mile before the finish that put him temporarily in second place 40 yards behind Benjamín Paredes. He ran a 5:15 final mile, including the detour, to beat Paredes and win the event by two seconds with a time of 2:11:21. The incident earned him the nickname \"Wrong Way Silva\"[26]\n\n\n\n#### 1995[edit]\n\n\nTo date, this event was the coldest NYC Marathon ever (1979 was the warmest, topping out at 80 degrees). The temperature at race time was 40 degrees and only went up a few degrees as the race progressed. Wind gusts between 30 and 45 mph produced a wind chill factor in the upper 20s. Both male and female winners repeated their 1994 victories. Germán Silva of Mexico was victorious in 2:11:00. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya won the women's race in 2:28:06. Loroupe had become the first woman from Africa to win the NYC Marathon the previous year.\n\n\n\n#### 1997[edit]\n\n\nThe total number of finishers exceeded 30,000 (30,427) for the first time. John Kagwe of Kenya won the men's race in 2:08:12, while Franziska Rochat-Moser from Switzerland was the first woman in 2:28:43.\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2000[edit]\n\n\nThe 2000 NYC Marathon included the wheelchair division for men and women for the first time. Prize money was added in 2001. Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco won the men's race in 2:10:09, becoming the first Moroccan man to take the title. Lyudmila Petrova of Russia was the first woman in 2:25:45, the first woman from Russia to win the event.\n\n\n\n#### 2001[edit]\n\n\nThe 2001 NYC Marathon took place on November 4, less than two months after the September 11 attacks. Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia set a new course record of 2:07:43, a mark that stood until Geoffrey Mutai broke it in 2011. On the women's side, Margaret Okayo of Kenya won, setting a new course record of 2:24:21. She would set another new record two years later that still stands.\n\n\n\n#### 2002[edit]\n\n\nThe nation of Kenya swept the top three spots in the men's elite race in this year's marathon, the first time in Marathon history that this has occurred. Rodgers Rop won in 2:08:07, while fellow Kenyan Christopher Cheboiboch finished 10 seconds behind in 2:08:17. *Laban Kipkemboi* of Kenya took third place in 2:08:39. On the women's side, Joyce Chepchumba, also of Kenya, won the women's elite race in 2:25:56. Lyubov Denisova of Russia placed second in 2:26:17 and Esther Kiplagat of Kenya was third in 2:27:00. This was also the first time that Kenyans won both the men's and women's race in marathon history.[27]\n\n\n\n#### 2003[edit]\n\n\nA record 34,729 people participated in the race. The top male finisher was Martin Lel of Kenya in a time of 2:10:30. The top female finisher was Margaret Okayo of Kenya in time of 2:22:31, breaking her previous course record of 2:24:21 set in 2001.[28] In recent years, runners from Kenya have dominated the event. The top Americans were Matt Downin (2:18:48) and Sylvia Mosqueda (2:33:10), both from California. Rapper P.Diddy also ran for charity and raised $2,000,000 for the New York City Education system.\n\n\n\n#### 2004[edit]\n\n\nThe top female finisher was Britain's Paula Radcliffe in a time of 2:23:10, beating Kenya's Susan Chepkemei by 4 seconds, the closest finish up to that time. The men's winner was Hendrik Ramaala of South Africa with a time of 2:09:28. The top Americans were Meb Keflezighi (2nd, 2:09:53) from California and Jenny Crain (15th, 2:41:06), from Wisconsin.[29]\n\n\n\n#### 2005[edit]\n\n\nIn the closest finish in New York City Marathon history, Paul Tergat of Kenya barely outsprinted Hendrick Ramaala of South Africa in the final meters of the race for a time of 2:09:30, beating Ramaala by one second. In the women's race, Jeļena Prokopčuka of Latvia won in a time of 2:24:41. Top amongst the Americans were Meb Keflezighi of California (2:09:56) and Jen Rhines of California (2:37:07). South African Ernst Van Dyk took the wheelchair race in 1:31:11.\n\n\nThe 2005 event was administered by new NYRR CEO Mary Wittenberg, the first woman director of an international Major marathon.[30]\n\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nThe top male finisher was Marílson Gomes dos Santos of Brazil in a time of 2:09:58, while Jeļena Prokopčuka of Latvia won the female marathon for the second consecutive time in 2:25:05. Gomes dos Santos became the first South American ever to win the race.[31] Stephen Kiogora of Kenya placed second, and Paul Tergat, the 2005 defending champion and former marathon world record holder, placed third.\n\n\nFormer American professional road racing cyclist and triathlete Lance Armstrong ran in the 2006 race, finishing 868th with a time of 2:59:36. He also ran the same year in the British 10K. Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee also completed the race in 2006, finishing in 5:33:43, and wearing bib #110, signifying the 110 pounds lost during his weight loss campaign.[32]\n\n\nAmanda McGrory won the female wheelchair race in a time of 1:54:17, while the male wheelchair division was won by Kurt Fearnley in a time of 1:29:22.\n\n\n\n#### 2007[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Runners before the race at Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in the 2007 marathon.\n![](image)Professional wheelers heading for the starting line in 2007.\nThe 2007 race was held on Sunday, November 4. It was the final race of the 2006–2007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also included the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because many had competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course.\n\n\nMartin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing a double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons. The women's winner was the world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain in a time of 2:23:09, one second faster than her 2004 win.\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\nThe 2008 New York City Marathon was held on Sunday, November 2. A field of 37,899 runners participated. The men's winner was Marílson Gomes dos Santos in 2:08:43. Paula Radcliffe won her third NYC marathon in 2:23:56.\n\n\nThe 2008 marathon events saw the deaths of three marathon participants. Carlos Jose Gomes, 58, of Brazil fell unconscious shortly after completing the race in 4:12:15. An autopsy revealed that he had a preexisting heart condition and died of a heart attack.[33] Joseph Marotta, 66, of Staten Island, N.Y. succumbed to a heart attack hours after he completed his fourth New York City Marathon. He walked the course in 9:16:46.[33] Fred Costa, 41, from Cincinnati, OH collapsed at the marathon and died on November 15 of a heart attack.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 2009[edit]\n\n\nThe 2009 New York City Marathon was held Sunday November 1, 2009. Meb Keflezighi of the United States won the men's race (the first American winner since Alberto Salazar in 1982) with a time of 2:09:15 while Ethiopian Derartu Tulu took the women's crown in 2:28:52, the first Ethiopian woman to do so. This was the first marathon in history with more than 40,000 official finishers, as 43,660 crossed the finish, 5,053 more than the previous best at the 2008 edition of this race.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Women lead pack at mile 17 in Manhattan\nMain article: 2010 New York City Marathon\n\nThe 2010 New York City Marathon was held on November 7. Gebregziabher Gebremariam of Ethiopia, in his first ever marathon, won the race after breaking away from his last rival, Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya, in the 25th mile to finish in a time of 2:08:14. The race featured 37-year-old world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who ran with a bad knee and dropped out of the race at the 16th mile. Afterwards, he announced his retirement,[37] but later reversed this decision. Edna Kiplagat won the women's title with a time of 2 hours, 28 minutes, 20 seconds, ahead of American Shalane Flanagan.\n\n\nThe total number of official finishers, 44,829 (28,757 men and 16,072 women) was a new world record for a marathon race.[38]\n\n\n\n#### 2011[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lead women in Brooklyn\nMain article: 2011 New York City Marathon\n\nThe 2011 Marathon was held on November 6. The men's event was won by Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in a time of 2:05:06, breaking the 10-year-old course record. Second-place runner Emmanuel Mutai, also of Kenya, and third-place runner Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia also beat the previous record for the event, with times of 2:06:28 and 2:07:14, respectively.[39] Geoffrey Mutai, who won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, became the first man to win both races in course-record time in the same year. Firehiwot Dado of Ethiopia won the women's race in a time of 2:23:15, her first major marathon victory.[40] Coming second, 4 seconds behind the leader originally from Ethiopia, but now living in the Bronx, was Bizunesh Deba with a time of 2:23:19.[41] There were a world record 46,795 official finishers: 29,867 men and 16,928 women.\n\n\nEdison Peña, one of the miners who had been trapped in the 2010 Copiapó mining accident, ran the race.[42] Former NHL player, Mark Messier, finished with a time of 4:14:21 at age 50. Retired Dutch soccer player Edwin van der Sar ran in 4:19 and said it was the toughest thing he had ever done.[43] Former CART champion Alex Zanardi won the handcycle class.[44]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nThe 2012 marathon was scheduled for November 4, 2012.[45] Organizers planned to hold the event despite the passage of Hurricane Sandy the week before.[46] However, on November 2, 2012, the marathon was cancelled; Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that: \"While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division... We would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants, and so we have decided to cancel it.\"[47][48] Three days earlier, Bloomberg had said that the marathon would take place. That declaration started a debate on whether to hold the race with thousands of residents still without electricity, public transportation, and other basic needs. Proponents for going ahead said that the event would give an economic and morale boost to the city, while opponents said the resources (such as food, water, and police) were better used elsewhere.[49][50]\n\n\nSome of the entrants ended up helping with cleanup efforts.[51] \nOthers chose to congregate and run an informal \"Shadow Marathon\" in Central Park.[52] Controversy over the cancellation of the Marathon, the timing of the announcement and the repercussions of the decision, including criticism of New York Road Runners CEO Mary Wittenberg, continued well after the 2012 race was meant to have taken place.[53][54] As a resolution, all who were registered to run the 2012 race were offered three options: a refund; guaranteed, non-complimentary entry to the New York City Marathon in 2013, 2014, or 2015; or guaranteed, non-complimentary entry to the NYC Half 2013.\n\n\n\n#### 2013[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entering the Queensboro Bridge\nMain article: 2013 New York City Marathon\n\nThe 2013 New York City Marathon was run November 3, 2013. The race proved to be the clincher for the 2013 World Marathon Majors titles for both men and women. Duplicating their London Marathon wins from April 2013, Tsegaye Kebede and Priscah Jeptoo each won $500,000 for their season-wide efforts. After the 2012 cancellation, Geoffrey Mutai returned to become the first repeat winner in 15 years (after John Kagwe in 1997–1998). Under windy conditions, his 2:08:24 was more than 3 minutes slower than in 2011. Mutai broke away around mile 22 to win by almost a minute over Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede, who had finished third two years earlier. Jeptoo spotted Buzunesh Deba, an Ethiopian runner who has lived in the Bronx since 2009, three and a half minutes at the half-marathon mark, but came back to pass her in the 24th mile.[55]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lead women in Greenpoint, Brooklyn\nMain article: 2014 New York City Marathon\n\nThe 2014 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 2, 2014.

Ghirmay Ghebreslassie won the men's competition with a time of 2:07:51. The female race winner was Mary Keitany from Kenya in 2:24:26. The men's wheelchair race winner was Marcel Hug with a time of 1:35:49, and the women's wheelchair race winner was Tatyana McFadden with a time of 1:47:43.[58] Lauren Lubin ran as the first openly non-binary athlete in the New York City Marathon.[59]\n\n\n#### 2017[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 New York City Marathon\n\n![](image)Union Street, Brooklyn\nThe 2017 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 5.

Their times of 2:05:59, 2:06:01 and 2:06:26 were the second, third and fourth fastest times in race history.\n\n\nMary Keitany was in a pack of women that passed halfway in 1:15:50 but then she ran the second 13.1 miles in 1:06:58, the fastest time ever for any second half of a marathon, to capture her fourth NYC crown in 2:22:48, the second fastest time ever there. London winner, Vivian Cheruiyot was second in 2:26:02 and American Shalane Flanagan placed third in 2:26:22, 31 seconds faster than her winning time the previous year.\n\n\nOnce again there were a world record number of finishers, with 52,812 (30,669 men/22,143 women) runners completing the race.\n\n\n\n#### 2019[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 New York City Marathon\nThe 49th New York City Marathon took place November 3.

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\nThe event attracts 500,000 spectators along the route, making it New England's most viewed sporting event.[4] Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event has grown to an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015.[5] The Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996 established a record as the world's largest marathon with 38,708 entrants, 36,748 starters, and 35,868 finishers.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Boston Marathon\n\n![](image)Boston Marathon Finish Line, 1910.\nThe Boston Marathon was first run in April 1897, having been inspired by the revival of the marathon for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Until 2020 it was the oldest continuously running marathon,[6] and the second longest continuously running footrace in North America, having debuted five months after the Buffalo Turkey Trot.[7]\n\n\nOn April 19, 1897, ten years after the establishment of the B.A.A., the association held the 24.5 miles (39.4 km) marathon to conclude its athletic competition, the B.A.A. Games.[3] The winner of the inaugural edition was John J. \"JJ\" McDermott,[4] who ran the 24.5 mile course in 2:55:10, leading a field of 15. The event was scheduled for the recently established holiday of Patriots' Day, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty.[8] The race, which became known as the Boston Marathon, has been held in some form every year since then, even during the World War years and the Great Depression, making it the world's oldest annual marathon. In 1924, the starting line was moved from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the neighboring town of Hopkinton. The course was lengthened to 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km) to conform to the standard set by the 1908 Summer Olympics and codified by the IAAF in 1921.[9] The first 1.9 miles (3.1 km) are run in Hopkinton before the runners enter Ashland.[10]\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon was originally a local event, but its fame and status have attracted runners from all over the world. For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964.[13] During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: \"While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons. As long as the war continues there, we positively will not accept Korean entries for our race on April 19.\"[14]\n\n\n\n### Bobbi Gibb, Kathrine Switzer, and Nina Kuscik[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Runner Kathrine Switzer attacked by race official Jock Semple in effort to prevent a woman from running the 1967 marathon\nThe Boston Marathon rule book made no mention of gender until after the 1967 race.[15] Nor did the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) exclude women from races that included men until after the 1967 Boston Marathon.[16] Roberta \"Bobbi\" Gibb's attempt to register for the 1966 race was refused by race director Will Cloney in a letter in which he claimed women were physiologically incapable of running 26 miles.[17]\nGibb nevertheless ran unregistered and finished the 1966 race in three hours, twenty-one minutes and forty seconds,[18] ahead of two-thirds of the runners. Much later, she would be recognized by the race organizers as the first woman to run the entire Boston Marathon. \n\n\nIn 1967, Kathrine Switzer, who registered for the race using her official AAU registration number, paying the entry fee, providing a properly acquired fitness certificate, and signing her entry form with her usual signature 'K. V. Switzer', was the first woman to run and finish with a valid official race registration.[15] As a result of Switzer's completion of the race as the first officially registered woman runner, the AAU changed its rules to ban women from competing in races against men.[16] Switzer finished the race despite race official Jock Semple repeatedly assaulting her in an attempt to rip off her race numbers and eject her from the race.[15][19]\n\n\nNina Kuscsik was instrumental in influencing the Amateur Athletic Union, in late 1971, to increase its maximum distance for sanctioned women's races, leading to official participation by women in marathons, beginning at Boston in 1972.[20] Kuscsik was the first woman to officially win the Boston Marathon, which occurred in 1972.[21]\n\n\nIn 1996, the B.A.A. retroactively recognized as champions the unofficial women's leaders of 1966 through 1971. In 2015, about 46 percent of the entrants were female.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rosie Ruiz, the impostor[edit]\n\n\nIn 1980, Rosie Ruiz crossed the finish line first in the women's race. However, marathon officials became suspicious, and it was discovered that she did not appear in race videotapes until near the end of the race, with a subsequent investigation concluding that she had skipped most of the race and blended into the crowd about a half-mile (800 m) from the finish line, where she then ran to her false victory. She was disqualified eight days later, and Canadian Jacqueline Gareau was proclaimed the winner.[22][23]\n\n\n\n### Participant deaths[edit]\n\n\nIn 1905, James Edward Brooks of North Adams, Massachusetts, died of pneumonia shortly after running the marathon.[24] In 1996, a 61-year-old Swedish man, Humphrey Siesage, died of a heart attack during the 100th running.[25] In 2002, Cynthia Lucero, 28, died of hyponatremia.[26]\n\n\n\n### 2011: Geoffrey Mutai and the IAAF[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Boston Marathon\n\nOn April 18, 2011, Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya won the 2011 Boston Marathon in a time of 2:03:02:00.[27] Although this was the fastest marathon ever run at the time, the International Association of Athletics Federations noted that the performance was not eligible for world record status given that the course did not satisfy rules that regarded elevation drop and start/finish separation (the latter requirement being intended to prevent advantages gained from a strong tailwind, as was the case in 2011).[28] The Associated Press (AP) reported that Mutai had the support of other runners who describe the IAAF's rules as \"flawed\".[29] According to the *Boston Herald*, race director Dave McGillivray said he was sending paperwork to the IAAF in an attempt to have Mutai's mark ratified as a world record.[27] Although this was not successful, the AP indicated that the attempt to have the mark certified as a world record \"would force the governing bodies to reject an unprecedented performance on the world's most prestigious marathon course\".[29]\n\n\n\n### 2013: Bombing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boston Marathon bombing\n\nOn April 15, 2013, the Boston Marathon was still in progress at 2:49 p.m. EDT (nearly three hours after the winner crossed the finish line), when two homemade bombs were set off about 200 yards (180 m) apart on Boylston Street, in approximately the last 225 yards (200 m) of the course. The race was halted, preventing many from finishing.[30][31] Three spectators were killed and an estimated 264 were injured.[32] Entrants who completed at least half the course and did not finish due to the bombing were given automatic entry in 2014.[33] In 2015, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the perpetrators of the bombing, was found guilty of 30 federal offenses in connection with the attack and was sentenced to death. His brother Tamerlan died after a gunfight with police and after Dzhokhar ran him over with a vehicle.[34][35]\n\n\n\n### 2014: Women's race disqualification[edit]\n\n\nBizunesh Deba of Ethiopia was eventually named women's winner of the 2014 Boston Marathon, following the disqualification of Kenyan Rita Jeptoo from the event due to confirmed doping. Deba finished in a time of 2:19:59, and became the course record holder. Her performance bested that of Margaret Okayo, who ran a time of 2:20:43 in 2002.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2016: Bobbi Gibb as grand marshal[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2016 Boston Marathon, Jami Marseilles, an American, became the first female double amputee to finish the Boston Marathon.[37][38] Bobbi Gibb, the first woman to have run the entire Boston Marathon (1966), was the grand marshal of the race.[39] The Women's Open division winner, Atsede Baysa, gave Gibb her trophy; Gibb said that she would go to Baysa's native Ethiopia in 2017 and return it to her.[40]\n\n\n\n### 2020: Cancellation[edit]\n\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Boston Marathon was initially rescheduled from April 20 to September 14.[41] It was the first postponement in the more than 100 year uninterrupted history of the event.[42]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2020, it was announced that the rescheduled marathon set for September 14 was canceled.[43] Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said of the decision to cancel the race, \"There's no way to hold this usual race format without bringing large numbers of people into close proximity. While our goal and our hope was to make progress in containing the virus and recovering our economy, this kind of event would not be responsible or realistic on September 14 or any time this year.\"[44]\n\n\nRunners were issued full refunds of entry fees.[45] Organizers later staged a \"virtual alternative\" in September 2020 as the 124th running of the marathon.[46] This was the second time that the format of the marathon was modified, the first having been in 1918, when the race was changed from a marathon to a military relay race (ekiden) because of World War I.[47]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Rescheduled to October[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Boston Marathon\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the B.A.A. announced that the 2021 edition of the marathon would not be held in April; organizers stated that they hoped to stage the event later in the year, possibly in the autumn.[48] In late January 2021, organizers announced October 11 as the date for the marathon, contingent upon road races being allowed in Massachusetts at that time.[49] In March, organizers announced that the field would be limited to 20,000 runners.[50] The race was the fourth of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all the events in the series were run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November.[51] In 2021, the B.A.A. also offered a virtual alternative to the in-person race to be completed anytime between 8-10 October.[52]\n\n\n\n## Race[edit]\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBoston Marathon   \n qualifying standards   \n (effective for 2020 race)[53]\n| Age\n | Men\n | Women\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 18–34 | 3 h 00 min | 3 h 30 min\n |\n| 35–39 | 3 h 05 min | 3 h 35 min\n |\n| 40–44 | 3 h 10 min | 3 h 40 min\n |\n| 45–49 | 3 h 20 min | 3 h 50 min\n |\n| 50–54 | 3 h 25 min | 3 h 55 min\n |\n| 55–59 | 3 h 35 min | 4 h 05 min\n |\n| 60–64 | 3 h 50 min | 4 h 20 min\n |\n| 65–69 | 4 h 05 min | 4 h 35 min\n |\n| 70–74 | 4 h 20 min | 4 h 50 min\n |\n| 75–79 | 4 h 35 min | 5 h 05 min\n |\n| ≥80 | 4 h 50 min | 5 h 20 min\n |\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon is open to runners 18 or older from any nation, but they must meet certain qualifying standards.[54] To qualify, a runner must first complete a standard marathon course certified by a national governing body affiliated with the World Athletics within a certain period of time before the date of the desired Boston Marathon (usually within approximately 18 months prior).\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, membership in USA Track & Field was required of all runners, but this requirement has been eliminated.\n\n\nQualifying standards for the 2013 race were tightened on February 15, 2011, by five minutes in each age-gender group for marathons run after September 23, 2011.[55] Prospective runners in the age range of 18–34 must run a time of no more than 3:00:00 (3 hours) if male, or 3:30:00 (3 hours 30 minutes) if female; the qualifying time is adjusted upward as age increases. In addition, the 59-second grace period on qualifying times has been completely eliminated; for example, a 40- to 44-year-old male will no longer qualify with a time of 3:10:01. For many marathoners, to qualify for Boston (to \"BQ\") is a goal and achievement in itself.[56][57]\n\n\nAn exception to the qualification times is for runners who receive entries from partners. About one-fifth of the marathon's spots are reserved each year for charities, sponsors, vendors, licensees, consultants, municipal officials, local running clubs, and marketers. In 2010, about 5,470 additional runners received entries through partners, including 2,515 charity runners.[58] The marathon currently allocates spots to two dozen charities who in turn are expected to raise more than $10 million a year.[59] In 2017, charity runners raised $34.2 million for more than 200 non-profit organizations. The Boston Athletic Association's Official Charity Program raised $17.96 million, John Hancock's Non-Profit Program raised $12.3 million, and the last $3.97 million was raised by other qualified and invitational runners.[60]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2010, the 20,000 spots reserved for qualifiers were filled in a record-setting eight hours and three minutes.[61] The speed of registration prompted the B.A.A. to change its qualifying standards for the 2013 marathon onward.[55] In addition to lowering qualifying times, the change includes a rolling application process, which gives faster runners priority. Organizers decided not to significantly adjust the number of non-qualifiers.\n\n\nOn September 27, 2018, the B.A.A. announced that they were lowering the qualifying times for the 2020 marathon by another five minutes, with male runners in the 18-34 age group required to run a time of 3:00:00 (3 hours) or less and female runners in the 18-34 age group required to run a time of 3:30:00 (3 hours, 30 minutes) or less in order to qualify.[53]\n\n\n\n### Race day[edit]\n\n\nThe race has traditionally been held on Patriots' Day,[62] a state holiday in Massachusetts, and until 1969 that was every April 19, whichever day of the week that fell on. From 1969 to 2019, the holiday was observed on the third Monday in April[63] and so the marathon date was correspondingly fixed to that Monday, often referred to by local residents as \"Marathon Monday\".[64]\n\n\n\n### Starting times[edit]\n\n\nThrough 2005, the race began at noon (wheelchair race at 11:25 a.m., and elite women at 11:31 a.m.), at the official starting point in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2006, the race used a staggered \"wave start\", where top-seeded runners (the elite men's group) and a first batch of up to 10,000 runners started at noon, with a second group starting at 12:30. The next year the starting times for the race were moved up, allowing runners to take advantage of cooler temperatures and enabling the roads to be reopened earlier. The marathon later added third and fourth waves to help further stagger the runners and reduce congestion.[65][66][67]\n\n\nThe starting times for 2019 were:[68][69]\n\n\n\n* Men's Push Rim Wheelchair: 9:02 a.m.\n* Women's Push Rim Wheelchair: 9:04 a.m.\n* Handcycles and Duos: 9:25 a.m.\n* Elite Women: 9:32 a.m.\n* Elite Men: 10 a.m.\n* Wave One: 10:02 a.m.\n* Wave Two: 10:25 a.m.\n* Wave Three: 10:50 a.m.\n* Wave Four: 11:15 a.m.\n\n\n### Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Course map\nThe course runs through 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km) of winding roads, following Route 135, Route 16, Route 30 and city streets into the center of Boston, where the official finish line is located at Copley Square, alongside the Boston Public Library. The race runs through eight Massachusetts cities and towns: Hopkinton, Ashland, Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Newton, Brookline, and Boston.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot on his way to winning the 2006 Boston Marathon, where he set a new course record.\nThe Boston Marathon is considered to be one of the more difficult marathon courses because of the Newton hills, which culminate in *Heartbreak Hill* near Boston College.[71] While the three hills on Commonwealth Avenue (Route 30) are better known, a preceding hill on Washington Street (Route 16), climbing from the Charles River crossing at 16 miles (26 km), is regarded by Dave McGillivray, the long-term race director, as the course's most difficult challenge.[72][73] This hill, which follows a 150-foot (46 m) rise over a 1⁄2 mile (800 m) stretch, forces many lesser-trained runners to a walking pace.\n\n\n\n#### Heartbreak Hill[edit]\n\n\nHeartbreak Hill is an ascent over 0.4 miles (600 m) between the 20- and 21-mile (32- and 34-km) marks, near Boston College. It is the last of four \"Newton hills\", which begin at the 16-mile (26 km) mark and challenge contestants with late (if modest) climbs after the course's general downhill trend to that point. Though Heartbreak Hill itself rises only 88 feet (27 m) vertically (from an elevation of 148 to 236 feet (45 to 72 m)),[74] it comes in the portion of a marathon distance where muscle glycogen stores are most likely to be depleted—a phenomenon referred to by marathoners as \"hitting the wall\".\n\n\nIt was on this hill that, in 1936, defending champion John A. \"Johnny\" Kelley overtook Ellison \"Tarzan\" Brown, giving him a consolatory pat on the shoulder as he passed. This gesture renewed the competitive drive in Brown, who rallied, pulled ahead of Kelley, and went on to win—thereby, it was said, breaking Kelley's heart.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participants in the 2010 Boston Marathon in Wellesley, just after the halfway mark\nBecause the course drops 459 feet (140 m) from start to finish[29] and the start is quite far west of the finish, allowing a helpful tailwind, the Boston Marathon does not satisfy two of the criteria necessary for the ratification of world[77] or American records.[78]\n\n\nAt the 2011 Boston Marathon on April 18, 2011, Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya ran a time of 2:03:02, which was the fastest ever marathon at the time (since surpassed by Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39 in Berlin 2018). However, due to the reasons listed above, Mutai’s performance was not ratified as an official world record. Bezunesh Deba from Ethiopia set the women's course record with a 2:19:59 performance on April 21, 2014. This was declared after Rita Jeptoo from Kenya was disqualified following a confirmed doping violation.[79]\n\n\nOther course records include:\n\n\n\n* Men's Masters: John Campbell (New Zealand), 2:11:04 (set in 1990)\n* Women's Masters: Firiya Sultanova-Zhdanova (Russia), 2:27:58 (set in 2002)\n* Men's Push Rim Wheelchair: Marcel Hug (Switzerland), 1:17:06 (set in 2023)\n* Women's Push Rim Wheelchair: Manuela Schär (Switzerland), 1:28:17 (set in 2017)\n* Men's Handcycle: Tom Davis (United States), 0:58:36 (set in 2017)\n* Women's Handcycle: Wendy Larsen (United States), 1:37:15 (set in 2021)\n\n\nOn only four occasions have world record times for marathon running been set in Boston.[*citation needed*] In 1947, the men's record time set was 2:25:39, by Suh Yun-Bok of South Korea. In 1975, a women's world record of 2:42:24 was set by Liane Winter of West Germany, and in 1983, Joan Benoit Samuelson of the United States ran a women's world record time of 2:22:43. In 2012 Joshua Cassidy of Canada set a men's wheelchair marathon world-record time of 1:18:25.\n\n\nIn 2007, astronaut Sunita Williams was an official entrant of the race, running a marathon distance while on the International Space Station, becoming the first person to run a marathon in space. She was sent a specialty bib and medal by the B.A.A. on the STS-117 flight of the Space Shuttle *Atlantis*.[80][81]\n\n\nThe race's organizers keep a standard time clock for all entries, though official timekeeping ceases after the six-hour mark.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## The B.A.A.[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boston Athletic Association\n\nThe *Boston Athletic Association* is a non-profit, organized sports association that organizes the Boston Marathon and other events.[3][82]\n\n\n\n## Divisions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, the Boston Marathon became the first major marathon to include a wheelchair division competition.[4] Bob Hall wrote race director Will Cloney to ask if he could compete in the race in his wheelchair. Cloney wrote back that he could not give Hall a race number, but would recognize Hall as an official finisher if he completed the race in under 3 hours and 30 minutes. Hall finished in 2 hours and 58 minutes, paving the way for the wheelchair division.[83] Ernst Van Dyk, in 2004, set a course record at 1:18.29, almost 50 minutes faster than the fastest runner.[84]\n\n\nHandcyclists have competed in the race since at least 2014. Starting in 2017, handcyclists are honored the same way runners and wheelchair racers are: with wreaths, prize money, and the playing of the men's and women's winners' national anthems.[85]\n\n\nIn addition to the push rim wheelchair division, the Boston Marathon[86] also hosts a blind/visually impaired division, and a mobility impaired program. Similar to the running divisions, a set of qualifying times has been developed for these divisions to motivate aspiring athletes and ensure competitive excellence. In 1986, the introduction of prize money at the Boston Marathon gave the push rim wheelchair division the richest prize purse in the sport. More than 1,000 people with disabilities and impairments have participated in the wheelchair division, while the other divisions have gained popularity each year.[87] In 2013, 40 blind runners participated.[88]\n\n\n\n## Memorial[edit]\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon Memorial in Copley Square, which is near the finish line, was installed to mark the one-hundredth running of the race. A circle of granite blocks set in the ground surrounds a central medallion that traces the race course and other segments that show an elevation map of the course and the names of the winners.[89][90]\n\n\n\n## Notable features[edit]\n\n\n### Spectators[edit]\n\n\nWith approximately 500,000 spectators, the Boston Marathon is New England's most widely viewed sporting event.[4] About 1,000 media members from more than 100 outlets received media credentials in 2011.[91]\n\n\nFor the entire distance of the race, thousands line the sides of the course to cheer the runners on, encourage them, and provide free water and snacks to the runners.\n\n\n\n### Scream Tunnel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Along the course at Wellesley College\nAt Wellesley College, a women's college, it is traditional for the students to cheer on the runners in what is referred to as the Scream Tunnel.[92][93] For about a quarter of a mile (400 m), the students line the course, scream, and offer kisses. \nThe Scream Tunnel is so loud runners claim it can be heard from a mile away. The tunnel is roughly half a mile (0.8 km) prior to the halfway mark of the course.[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nEvery year, the Boston Red Sox play a home game at Fenway Park, starting at 11:05 a.m. When the game ends, the crowd empties into Kenmore Square to cheer as the runners enter the final mile. This tradition started in 1903.[96] In the 1940s, the Red Sox from the American League and the Boston Braves from the National League (who moved to Milwaukee after the 1953 season) alternated yearly as to which would play the morning game. In 2007, the game between the Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was delayed until 12:18 p.m. due to heavy rain. The marathon, which had previously been run in a wide variety of weather conditions, was not delayed.[97] The 2018 game hosting the Baltimore Orioles was postponed into May due to rain,[98] while 2020 saw the game not played resulting from the pandemic.\n\n\n\n### Dick and Rick Hoyt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Team Hoyt at ~12.8 miles on the Marathon course on April 16, 2012Dick and Rick Hoyt entered the Boston Marathon 32 times.[99] Dick was the father of Rick, who had cerebral palsy. While doctors said that Rick would never have a normal life and thought that institutionalizing him was the best option, Dick and his wife disagreed and raised him at home. Eventually, a computer device was developed that helped Rick communicate with his family, and they learned that one of his biggest passions was sports. \"Team Hoyt\" (Dick and Rick) started competing in charity runs, with Dick pushing Rick in a wheelchair. Through August 2008, Dick and Rick had competed in 66 marathons and 229 triathlons. Their fastest marathon finish was 2:40:47.[*citation needed*] The team completed their 30th Boston Marathon in 2012, when Dick was 72 and Rick was 50.[100] They had intended the 2013 marathon to be their final one, but due to the Boston Marathon bombing, they were stopped a mile short of completing their run, and decided to run one more marathon the following year. They completed the 2014 marathon on April 21, 2014, having previously announced that it would be their last.[101] In tribute to his connection with the race, Dick was named the Grand Marshal of the 2015 marathon. He died in 2021, aged 80.[102] Rick died in May 2023.[103]\n\n\n### Bandits[edit]\n\n\nUnlike many other races, the Boston Marathon tolerated \"bandits\" (runners who do not register and obtain a bib number).[104] They used to be held back until after all the registered runners had left the starting line, and then were released in an unofficial fourth wave. They were generally not pulled off the course and mostly allowed to cross the finish line.[104] For decades, these unofficial runners were treated like local folk heroes, celebrated for their endurance and spunk for entering a contest with the world's most accomplished athletes.[105] Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillivray was once a teenage bandit.[106]\n\n\nGiven the increased field that was expected for the 2014 Marathon, however, organizers planned \"more than ever\" to discourage bandits from running.[107] As of September 2015 the B.A.A. website states:\n\n\n\n\n> Q: Can I run in the Boston Marathon as an unofficial or \"bandit\" runner?\n> A: No, please do NOT run if you have not been officially entered in the race. Race amenities along the course and at the finish, such as fluids, medical care, and traffic safety, are provided based on the number of expected official entrants. Any addition to this by way of unofficial participants, adversely affects our ability to ensure a safe race for everyone.[108]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Costumes[edit]\n\n\nA number of people choose to run the course in a variety of costumes each year.[109][110] During the 100th running in 1996, one runner wore a scale model of the Old North Church steeple on his back. Old North Church is where the signal was lit that set Paul Revere off on his midnight ride, which is commemorated each year on the same day as the Marathon. During the 2014 marathon, runners and spectators were discouraged from wearing \"costumes covering the face or any non-form fitting, bulky outfits extending beyond the perimeter of the body,\" for security reasons following the 2013 bombing. However, state authorities and the Boston Athletic Association did not outright ban such costumes.[111]\n\n\n\n### Ondekoza *taiko* drummers[edit]\n\n\n![A marathon runner with a red shirt playing taiko drums after finishing the marathon](image)Ondekoza member Marco Lienhard playing *taiko* after finishing the marathon\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The 700-pound (320 kg) drum would be set up at the finish line to encourage runners finishing the marathon. Bill Rodgers was a guest on Sado Island and ran marathons in Japan with Ondekoza members. The group also ran the New York City Marathon and Los Angeles Marathon, and ran 10,000 miles (16,000 km) of the perimeter of the United States from 1990 to 1993.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of winners of the Boston Marathon\n* List of marathon races in North America\n* The Sports Museum (at TD Garden)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Marathon Dates\". *BAA.org*.

It is a World Athletics Platinum Label[3] marathon and one of the six World Marathon Majors.[4] The latest edition of the race took place on 5 March 2023. It is sponsored by Tokyo Metro.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Tokyo Marathon\n\nThe first Tokyo Marathon was held on 18 February 2007. However, years prior to 2007, Tokyo Marathon actually consisted of two marathons - the Tokyo International Marathon which took place on even years, and Tokyo - New York Friendship International Marathon which took place on odd years. In the inaugural year, 1981, both marathons took place. However, because it was not possible to support two marathons a month apart in the same city, from 1982, the alternating format went into effect.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 2007 marathon was also a representative selection race of the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka. The total number of participants was set at 30,000. Of that, 25,000 people signed up for the marathon, and 5,000 signed up for the 10K run.\n\n\nMasakazu Fujiwara became the race's first Japanese male winner at the fourth edition.[5]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Dickson Chumba won in a record time of 2:05:42. This was only the second time a runner ran below 2h06 in Japan, after Tsegaye Kebede in Fukuoka Marathon (December 6, 2009). His runner-up, Tadese Tola did also run below 2:06, in a time of 2:05:57.[6]\n\n\nIn January 2020, rock musician Hyde released the song \"Believing in Myself\" as a single inspired by the event.[7] Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, only elite runners were invited to the 2020 Tokyo Marathon.

It is one of the six World Marathon Majors.[1] Thus, it is also a World Athletics Label Road Race. The Chicago Marathon is the fourth-largest race by number of finishers worldwide.[2]\n\n\nAnnual Chicago marathons were held from 1905 to the 1920s, but the first race in the present series occurred on September 25, 1977, under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon, which drew a field of 4,200 runners. The race has been held every year since, except in 1987 when only a half-marathon was run, and in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4][5] It became among the fastest-growing modern-marathon road races in the world, due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances.[6] The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationships with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances. Since 2008, the race has been sponsored and organized by Bank of America, and is officially known as the **Bank of America Chicago Marathon**.\n\n\nThe race is limited to 45,000 runners and only runners who finish within 61⁄2 hours are officially timed.[6][7] Those wishing to participate can register after either meeting a time qualifying standard or being selected through a general lottery.[8] Although the race has limited registration, exceptions include elite runners, legacy finishers, and charity representatives.[9] Increasingly, local, national and global charities as well as humanitarian organizations encourage sponsored participation in the event as a means of fund raising.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Chicago Marathon\n\n![](image)The former logo before the current sponsor\nThe first modern marathon at the 1896 Games of the I Olympiad in Greece generated interest in the sport which led to similar races throughout most western countries and across the United States. While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis,[12] the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race.[13] Beginning in 1905,[14] the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the *Chicago Daily News* after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)First Chicago Marathon September 23, 1905. Louis Marks in the lead.\nThe first Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905.[13] That first race began at the Evanston Golf Club and finished in front of a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park Race Track. Beginning with a little over a dozen runners, only seven completed the course.[16] In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Chicagoan Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks.[14] With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s, eventually on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route.[15] The second year, feet bleeding, Canadian Dennis Bennett won, while a band played \"Maple Leaf Forever\". In the early years, runners had their own regimens: John Lindquist from Brooklyn took a commanding lead in 1907 while doing whiskey shots, but by mile 23, he was apparently falling asleep; while, the next year, the French-born Chicagoan Albert Corey had more success sipping champagne.[16] Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.[17]\n\n\nIt was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the public's eyes. Frank Shorter's 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle-class American ideals.[18] Then the 1976 New York City Marathon, which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course, popularized the big city marathon. As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon.[3] By the mid-1980s, the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons.[19] During the mid-1980s, it was named America's Marathon/Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments. Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathons of the mid-1980s as \"The World's Marathon\".[20] The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)The founding location of the Chicago Marathon is at 214 West Erie in River North.\nThe modern era Chicago Marathon was founded over the objection of Ed Kelly, Chicago Park District Superintendent who refused permission to run in the parks or along the Lake Michigan lakefront. With the help of Lee Flaherty, the event's founder who operated out of Flair House in the Near North Side community area of Chicago,[21] Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's support for the marathon was enlisted. Although Mayor Daley died, his successor Michael Anthony Bilandic approved the race and got Kelly on board. Michael Bilandic, a runner, and his wife actually passed out medals at the first marathon on September 25, 1977. This first edition of the modern Chicago Marathon was called the Mayor Daley Marathon.[22] Flaherty footed the bill for the first race, which had no sponsors. He again footed the bill in 1978 when the race was again called the Mayor Daley Marathon. In 1979, however, Beatrice Foods became the first race sponsor.\n\n\n\n![](image)Evans Cheruiyot follows the course car (with clock) during his 2008 victory. The lead course car carries the current race time.\nIn the early years the Chicago Marathon was held in August.[23] It has from its inception with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers been one of the nation's largest marathons. The 2000 running was second only to New York.[24] The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer.[18] By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons. In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's).[18] The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. The 1985 race was spectacular with Steve Jones breaking his own course record (2 seconds short of the world record) and Joan Benoit Samuelson the 1984 Olympic Champion, two-time defending Chicago Marathon Champion and Olympic Bronze Medalist, Rosa Mota and the fourth place Olympic finisher and world record setting Ingrid Kristiansen. Benoit set a record that stood nearly a generation. At that time, it was considered the premier marathon in the United States, if not the world.[25] Although 1986 had 40 world-class runners among the 8,000 participants the times paled in comparison.[26] Beatrice dropped out as a sponsor in 1987. Because of this only a half-marathon race was held that year[5] and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988[27] and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon.[28] The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions.[29] In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned.[30] In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank.[31] In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon.[32] In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty.[33][34] In 1998, the race began using transponder timing.[35] In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women's world record marathon time, both the men's and women's then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)2007 Chicago Marathon temperatures.\nIn 2007, Bank of America acquired LaSalle Bank's parent company ABN AMRO North America in 2007 and assumed the race's title sponsorship.[37][38] The 2007 race made history with the first ever CEO Marathon Challenge. The race featured a special competition among the CEOs, presidents, company owners and c-suite executives of companies with at least $5 million in annual gross revenue ($2.5 million for women).[39] The 2007 race also made history for having three (men's, women's & men's wheelchair) of its four races decided in the final 100 meters in a day of record setting heat.[40] The race was partially shut down early (after three and a half hours) as temperatures rose to an unseasonably hot 88 °F (31 °C), which surpassed both the temperature records for the Chicago Marathon and official Chicago records for October 7.[41] Over 10,000 registrants chose not to run in the record temperatures, while 10,934 people did not finish (many were called after the course closed early for safety).[4][40][42] One runner died, over 30 were hospitalized, and over 400 others sought medical attention. Marathon owner and sponsor Bank of America, which had just acquired LaSalle Bank, has denied culpability. Similar hot conditions have been experienced in other city center races. In 2003, London's The British 10K also had extremely hot weather that affected many runners.[42][43]\n\n\nThe 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of either transferring their entry to 2021, 2022, or 2023, or obtaining a full refund.[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chicago Marathon start/finish in Grant Park, October 2006\nThe marathon course is a loop course, starting and ending at Grant Park. From there, the current course winds through 29 of the city's neighborhoods.[46] The course loop can be generally divided into three sections: North, West, and South. In each of these sections, three of the city's main stadiums are near the course's turning points: Wrigley Field to the north; the United Center to the west; and Guaranteed Rate Field to the south. The city's fourth professional stadium, Soldier Field, is located near the start/finish area.\n\n\nFor the first three miles, runners wind through Chicago's downtown area. Eventually, they head north along LaSalle Street.\n\n\nRunners are supported by over 12,000 volunteers[47] spread throughout the course including at 20 aid stations[48] located approximate every 1–3 miles.[49] For runners in distress, aid station volunteers include medical staff and ambulatory services are scattered throughout the course.\n\n\nDigital timers are positioned every 5 kilometers, as well as the halfway point.\n\n\n\n\n## Runner statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nChicago Marathon Finishers (2000–present)  \n Total finishers and by gender\n| Year\n | Finishers\n | Avg Finish Time\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | Male\n | Female\n |\n| 2000 | 27,870\n | 16,802\n | 11,068\n | 4:21:46\n |\n| 2001 | 28,390\n | 17,129\n | 11,261\n | 4:19:28\n |\n| 2002 | 31,093\n | 18,111\n | 12,982\n | 4:19:51\n |\n| 2003 | 32,395\n | 18,720\n | 13,675\n | 4:25:09\n |\n| 2004 | 33,033\n | 19,073\n | 13,960\n | 4:26:53\n |\n| 2005 | 32,995\n | 18,673\n | 14,322\n | 4:26:22\n |\n| 2006 | 33,618\n | 18,904\n | 14,714\n | 4:25:02\n |\n| 2007 | 28,815\n | 16,945\n | 11,870\n | 4:52:11\n |\n| 2008 | 31,343\n | 17,675\n | 13,668\n | 4:46:30\n |\n| 2009 | 33,475\n | 18,983\n | 14,492\n | 4:27:20\n |\n| 2010 | 36,159\n | 19,973\n | 16,186\n | 4:43:48\n |\n| 2011 | 35,670\n | 20,256\n | 15,414\n | 4:40:34\n |\n| 2012 | 37,455\n | 20,688\n | 16,767\n | 4:32:02\n |\n| 2013 | 39,122\n | 21,618\n | 17,504\n | 4:32:23\n |\n| 2014 | 40,801\n | 22,299\n | 18,502\n | 4:33:03\n |\n| 2015 | 37,182\n | 20,144\n | 17,038\n | 4:33:14\n |\n| 2016 | 40,608\n | 22,045\n | 18,563\n | 4:34:48\n |\n| 2017 | 44,508\n | 22,906\n | 21,602\n | 4:47:23\n |\n| 2018 | 44,584\n | 23,934\n | 20,650\n | 4:34:01\n |\n| 2019 | 45,956\n | 24,626\n | 21,330\n | 4:29:51\n |\n| 2020\n | *cancelled in pandemic*[44] |\n| 2021 | 26,112\n | 14,228\n | 11,884\n | 4:42:32\n |\n| 2022 | 39,420\n | 20,931\n | 18,489\n | 4:29:09\n |\n| 2023 | 48,574\n | 25,858\n | 22,626\n | 4:21:03\n |\n| Source:[50]|[51]|[52]|[53]\"Chicago Marathon Race Results 2023\". *www.marathonguide.com*. Retrieved October 11, 2023. |\n\n\nThe Bank of America Chicago Marathon has grown significantly from its beginnings. In 1905, 20 runners registered for the first Chicago Marathon, 15 actually started the race, and 7 finished.[17] For the first \"modern\" marathon race in 1977, 4,200 people took part.[54] In 1995, 9,000 people registered, and in 1999, over 29,000 people registered. The 2001 marathon run on October 7 reached its cap of 37,500, which was instituted after the 2000 race drew 33,171 runners,[55] just prior to the entry deadline on September 19.[56] In 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 it reached its cap of 40,000.[3][57] The October 10, 2004, October 9, 2005 and October 22, 2006 races reached their 40,000 entrant caps on August 16, July 14, and May 26 respectively.[57][58][59] On April 18, 2007, the 2007 race run on October 7 reached its cap of 45,000 entrants.[60] There was a late registration exemption whereby elite runners (marathon times of less than 2:31/3:01 or half marathon times of 1:11/1:21 for (men/women)) could register until September 1 even though the race had reached its registration cap in the spring.[61] The 40,000 registrants and 33,000 finishers in 2003 made the Chicago Marathon the third or fourth largest marathon depending on which metric (registrants or finishers) is used.[62]\n\n\nThe Chicago Marathon has never excluded women. Historically, however, the women's field has been smaller than the men's. This seems to be the result of older age categories having large multiples of men to women, but the women are beginning to outnumber the men in the 20s age group of the field.[63]\n\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\nWorld records have been broken at Chicago six times.[64] In 1984, Steve Jones broke the world record with 2:08:05. In 1999, Khalid Khannouchi was the first to surpass 2:06:00 with 2:05:42. \n\n\nThe men's course record was broken in the 2013 race by Dennis Kimetto with a time of 2:03:45.[65] On October 8, 2023, Kelvin Kiptum set a new world record, and therefore also the Chicago course record, completing the course in 2:00:35.[66]\n\n\nThe women's record was broken in two consecutive years. In 2001, Catherine Ndereba broke the record in 2:18:47, and Paula Radcliffe surpassed that mark with 2:17:18 the year after. In 2019, Brigid Kosgei won in a world record time of 2:14:04, which was surpassed in 2023 by Sifan Hassan setting a new course record of 2:13:44.[67]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic impact[edit]\n\n\nMuch of the marathon's impact is derived from the tourism industry. More than 10,000 of the runners in 2010 indicated that it was their first visit to Chicago. Of that, 6,000 came from 100 countries. Due to the travelers, the event increases hotel occupancy rates during the marathon. According to an independent study by the University of Illinois, the 2015 marathon contributed an estimated US$277 million worth of activity to the Chicago economy, equivalent to 1,948 jobs.[68]\n\n\n\n### Charity program[edit]\n\n\nSince the charity program was officially established in 2002, more than 106,000 runners have raised over $207 million for local, national and global causes.[69]\n\n\nCharity fundraising is now closely intertwined with the event as the runners now raise money for research, aid the suffering and heighten public awareness of different causes.[70] The marathon offers all registered entrants the opportunity to fundraise for a charity partner. The marathon recognizes four levels of charities based on the number of participants recruited, and fundraising levels.[71]\n\n\nRunners can also opt out of the public lottery or obtain a guaranteed place after this has been drawn by choosing to run for an official charity. The 2016 event had over 170 charity partners, and raised more than US$16.9 million.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2005 LaSalle Bank ABN Amro Chicago Marathon at Grand Avenue passing under Michigan Avenue (Chicago) along the Magnificent Mile.\n\n\n| Year\n | Charity count\n | Charity runner count\n | Funds raised\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | 7 | — | —\n |\n| 2002\n | 14 | 1,674 | $2,950,000\n |\n| 2003\n | 19 | 2,527 | $4,540,000\n |\n| 2004\n | 29 | 2,449 | $4,740,000\n |\n| 2005\n | 43 | 3,000 | $6,317,000\n |\n| 2006\n | 60 | 4,500 | $9,500,000\n |\n| 2007\n | 85 | 6,600 | $9,985,482\n |\n| 2008\n | 110 | 6,745 | $9,209,000\n |\n| 2009\n | 123 | 8,768 | $10,183,855\n |\n| 2010\n | 150 | 9,842 | $12,109,000\n |\n| 2011\n | 162 | 10,192 | $13,400,000\n |\n| 2012\n | 170 | 10,693 | $15,300,000\n |\n| 2013\n | 140 | 10,712 | $15,000,000\n |\n| 2014\n | 195 | 9,107 | $17,300,000\n |\n| 2015\n | 172 | 9,549 | $18,700,000[73] |\n| 2016\n | 170+ | 9,313 | $16,900,000[72] |\n| 2017\n | 180 | 10,525 | $18,500,000[74] |\n| 2018\n | 170 | 11,625 | $22,700,000[69] |\n| 2019\n | 172 | 12,000+ | $27,100,000[75] |\n| Source: 2015 Chicago Marathon Media Guide[76] |\n\n\n## Deaths[edit]\n\n\n* 1998 – Kelly Barrett, 43, Littleton, Colorado – Believed to be caused by hyponatremia[23][77]\n* 2000 – Danny Towns, 45, Edmond, Oklahoma – Cardiac arrest[23][78]\n* 2001 – Luke Roach, 22, Seattle, Washington – Collapsed near finish line.

Held annually since 1974,[a] the event includes multiple races over the marathon distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 mi), including elite level road running competitions for men and women, a race for the public, an inline skating race, a wheelchair race, and a handcycle race.\n\n\nEvents are split over two days, with skaters competing on the marathon course on Saturday before the running events. Power walkers, hand-bikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 kilometres (2.6219 mi), 1/10 of the regular distance)[4] are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS. The elite running and wheelchair races are part of the World Marathon Majors, an annual series of top level races offering a $1 million prize purse. BMW is the current title sponsor for the race.\n\n\nThe city's flat course regularly produces fast performances: a record eight women scored times below 2:20 in the 2023 race, and a record nine men were below 2:05 and 15 finished inside 2:06.[5] The marathon world record has been broken in Berlin on thirteen occasions, particularly the most recent eight instances on the men's progression (as of September 2022[update]). The current record was set at the 2022 edition, where Eliud Kipchoge won the men's race in 2:01:09. Tigist Assefa set a new women's world record in 2023 with 2:11:53. In the wheelchair race, Catherine Debrunner (Switzerland) 2023 broke the world record in 1:34:16 hours.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eliud Kipchoge running world record (2:01:09) at the 2022 Berlin Marathon\nThe Berlin Marathon was established in 1974 by Horst Milde, a baker and running enthusiast in the city. The race had 244 finishers; 234 men and 10 women, and was won by Günter Hallas and Jutta von Haase in times of 2:44:53 and 3:22:01 respectively. In 1977, Christa Vahlensieck established a new women's world record at the Berlin Marathon, running 2:34:47. Four years later, the race started outside the Reichstag for the first time, by which time it had grown to 2,583 finishers, making it the largest city road race in Germany. The following year, before German unification, some East Germans secretly ran the race, registering under false names to avoid recriminations from the East German secret service. In 1989, a children's race was added to the event, and eight years later an inline skating marathon was contested.[7][8]\n\n\nIn 1998, Ronaldo da Costa set a new men's world record, the only South American to hold a marathon world record. Two years later, one of the race's pacemakers, Simon Biwott won the race, after one of the favourites had pulled out in the second half of the race. In 2001, Naoko Takahashi became the first woman to run a sub-2:20 marathon, completing the Berlin Marathon in 2:19:46. The race had continued to be the venue of world records; between 2003 and 2018, seven men's records were set at the race; the most recent remains as the current world record time; Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39.[7][8]\n\n\nThe event was held in mid-September in 2000 and 2018, because of a conflict with the Women's Olympic Marathon, and due to German Unity Day preparations, respectively.[9]\n\n\nThe 2020 edition of the event was prohibited from being held on its originally scheduled dates due to the coronavirus pandemic,[10] and was eventually cancelled once it was clear that it would not be possible to hold it at a later date in 2020.[3] All registrants were given the option of either transferring their entry to 2021 or obtaining a refund.[3]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe marathon course is set throughout several boroughs in Berlin with start and finish near the Brandenburg Gate (bottom right).\n\nThe course within the metropolis starts and finishes near the Brandenburg Gate. Due to the division of the city, the marathon events before 1990 were limited to West Berlin only. On 30 September 1990 athletes were able to run through the Brandenburg Gate for the first time and since then, the course has covered both halves of the unified city. It was reported that a great many of the runners had tears in their eyes as they ran through the gate.[11]\n\n\nNowadays, after leaving Brandenburg Gate, the course passes Charlottenburg, around Tiergarten, along Moabit and Mitte, and then south to Friedrichshain. After that, it winds west between Kreuzberg and Neukölln, through Schöneberg, over to Friedenau and Zehlendorf, before turning north back toward the city's center. Looping above Schöneberg, the course comes full circle as it finishes through the Gate.[11]\n\n\nThere have been two other major international marathons in Berlin. At the 1936 Olympic Games and at the 2009 IAAF World Championships, both using different routes. A marathon in Berlin on 14 Oct 1973 was won by Ulrich Hutmacher (GER) with a time of 2:19:32, but that race is not considered to be part of the Berlin Marathon series.\n\n\n\n## Sponsors[edit]\n\n\nThere have been several title sponsors in the race's history. From 1974 until 1989 it was just the *Berlin Marathon*. In 1990, it was the *Yanase Berlin Marathon*. In 1991 and 1992 it was the *Canon Berlin Marathon*. It reverted to simply the *Berlin Marathon* from 1993 until 1997. It then became the *Alberto Berlin Marathon* in 1998 and 1999. A new title sponsor changed the name to the *real,- Berlin Marathon* from 2000 to 2010. Since 2011 it has been called the *BMW Berlin Marathon*.\n\n\n\n## Finishers[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of finishing athletes, Berlin is one of four world-wide marathons with more than 40,000 finishers, along with the New York City Marathon, Chicago Marathon, and Paris Marathon.\n\n\n\n![](image)2009 Berlin Marathon\n![](image)World record winner Haile Gebrselassie on his way to his fourth straight

Both these athletes also hold the records for time, with Frei setting the men's race record of 1:21:39 in 1997 and Schär setting the women's race record of 1:36:53 in 2018.[15]\n\n\n**Key**:    Course record (in bold)\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Men's winner\n | Time[b] | Women's winner\n | Time[b] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981\n | ![](image) Georg Freund (FRG) | 2:08:44\n | *not held* |\n| 1982\n | ![](image) Bosse Lindquist (SWE) | 2:03:10\n |\n| 1983\n | ![](image) Gregor Golombek (FRG) | 1:55:10\n | ![](image) Gabriele Beyer (FRG) | 2:51:12\n |\n| 1984\n | ![](image) Bosse Lindquist (SWE) | 2:16:32\n | ![](image) Gabriele Beyer (FRG) | 2:47:14\n |\n| 1985\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:57:28\n | ![](image) Gabriele Schild (SUI) | 2:33:51\n |\n| 1986\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:46:44\n | ![](image) Connie Hansen (DEN) | 2:32:23\n |\n| 1987\n | ![](image) Gregor Golombek (FRG) | 1:46:52\n | ![](image) Margit Quell (FRG) | 2:21:29\n |\n| 1988\n | ![](image) Markus Pilz (FRG) | 1:52:08\n | ![](image) Gabriele Schild (SUI) | 2:52:29\n |\n| 1989\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:40:11\n | ![](image) Daniela Jutzeler (SUI) | 1:55:23\n |\n| 1990\n | ![](image) Jean-Marc Berset (SUI) | 1:34:41\n | ![](image) Daniela Jutzeler (SUI) | 1:57:47\n |\n| 1991\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:27:39\n | ![](image) Beate Meier (GER) | 1:51:50\n |\n| 1992\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:29:41\n | ![](image) Jennette Jansen (NED) | 1:42:07\n |\n| 1993\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:27:16\n | ![](image) Lily Anggreny (GER) | 1:50:34\n |\n| 1994\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:22:12\n | ![](image) Louise Sauvage (AUS) | 1:57:14\n |\n| 1995\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:22:49\n | ![](image) Lily Anggreny (GER) | 1:58:38\n |\n| 1996\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:25:34\n | ![](image) Monica Wetterström (SWE) | 1:54:00\n |\n| 1997\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | **1:21:39** | ![](image) Louise Sauvage (AUS) | 1:49:58\n |\n| 1998\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:24:19\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:47:53\n |\n| 1999\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:23:57\n | ![](image) Monica Wetterström (SWE) | 1:48:12\n |\n| 2000\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:26:30\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:52:31\n |\n| 2001\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:30:24\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:47:46\n |\n| 2002\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:28:28\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:45:52\n |\n| 2003\n | ![](image) Joël Jeannot (FRA) | 1:25:19\n | ![](image) Yvonne Sehmisch (GER) | 1:52:05\n |\n| 2004\n | ![](image) Thomas Gerlach (DEN) | 1:33:49\n | *not held* |\n| 2005\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:28:32\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:49:46\n |\n| 2006\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:29:30\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:42:52\n |\n| 2007\n | ![](image) Masazumi Soejima (JPN) | 1:26:50\n | ![](image) Simone Buess (SUI) | 1:48:50\n |\n| 2008\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:27:55\n | ![](image) Sandra Hager (SUI) | 2:04:21\n |\n| 2009\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:28:38\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:39:31\n |\n| 2010\n | ![](image) Masazumi Soejima (JPN) | 1:28:46\n | ![](image) Wakako Tsuchida (JPN) | 1:46:15\n |\n| 2011\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:31\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:45:20\n |\n| 2012\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:43\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:46:19\n |\n| 2013\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:31:00\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:41:39\n |\n| 2014\n | ![](image) Kota Hokinoue (JPN) | 1:32:25\n | ![](image) Shelly Woods (GBR) | 1:47:56\n |\n| 2015\n | ![](image) David Weir (GBR) | 1:27:36\n | ![](image) Natalia Kocherova (RUS) | 1:50:36\n |\n| 2016\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:51\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:43:00\n |\n| 2017\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:03\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:40:05\n |\n| 2018\n | ![](image) Brent Lakatos (CAN) | 1:29:41\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:36:53\n |\n| 2019\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:28:09\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:38:07\n |\n| 2020[3] | *cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic* |\n| 2021[16] | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:24:03\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:37:31\n |\n| 2022[17] | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:24:56\n | ![](image) Catherine Debrunner (SUI) | **1:36:47** |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of marathon races in Europe\n* Sport in Berlin\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The event was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** h:m:s\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** BERLIN-MARATHON: Zahlen und Rekorde: Die Teilnehmerzahlen 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"47.

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\nThe event attracts 500,000 spectators along the route, making it New England's most viewed sporting event.[4] Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event has grown to an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015.[5] The Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996 established a record as the world's largest marathon with 38,708 entrants, 36,748 starters, and 35,868 finishers.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Boston Marathon\n\n![](image)Boston Marathon Finish Line, 1910.\nThe Boston Marathon was first run in April 1897, having been inspired by the revival of the marathon for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Until 2020 it was the oldest continuously running marathon,[6] and the second longest continuously running footrace in North America, having debuted five months after the Buffalo Turkey Trot.[7]\n\n\nOn April 19, 1897, ten years after the establishment of the B.A.A., the association held the 24.5 miles (39.4 km) marathon to conclude its athletic competition, the B.A.A. Games.[3] The winner of the inaugural edition was John J. \"JJ\" McDermott,[4] who ran the 24.5 mile course in 2:55:10, leading a field of 15. The event was scheduled for the recently established holiday of Patriots' Day, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty.[8] The race, which became known as the Boston Marathon, has been held in some form every year since then, even during the World War years and the Great Depression, making it the world's oldest annual marathon. In 1924, the starting line was moved from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the neighboring town of Hopkinton. The course was lengthened to 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km) to conform to the standard set by the 1908 Summer Olympics and codified by the IAAF in 1921.[9] The first 1.9 miles (3.1 km) are run in Hopkinton before the runners enter Ashland.[10]\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon was originally a local event, but its fame and status have attracted runners from all over the world. For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964.[13] During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: \"While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons. As long as the war continues there, we positively will not accept Korean entries for our race on April 19.\"[14]\n\n\n\n### Bobbi Gibb, Kathrine Switzer, and Nina Kuscik[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Runner Kathrine Switzer attacked by race official Jock Semple in effort to prevent a woman from running the 1967 marathon\nThe Boston Marathon rule book made no mention of gender until after the 1967 race.[15] Nor did the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) exclude women from races that included men until after the 1967 Boston Marathon.[16] Roberta \"Bobbi\" Gibb's attempt to register for the 1966 race was refused by race director Will Cloney in a letter in which he claimed women were physiologically incapable of running 26 miles.[17]\nGibb nevertheless ran unregistered and finished the 1966 race in three hours, twenty-one minutes and forty seconds,[18] ahead of two-thirds of the runners. Much later, she would be recognized by the race organizers as the first woman to run the entire Boston Marathon. \n\n\nIn 1967, Kathrine Switzer, who registered for the race using her official AAU registration number, paying the entry fee, providing a properly acquired fitness certificate, and signing her entry form with her usual signature 'K. V. Switzer', was the first woman to run and finish with a valid official race registration.[15] As a result of Switzer's completion of the race as the first officially registered woman runner, the AAU changed its rules to ban women from competing in races against men.[16] Switzer finished the race despite race official Jock Semple repeatedly assaulting her in an attempt to rip off her race numbers and eject her from the race.[15][19]\n\n\nNina Kuscsik was instrumental in influencing the Amateur Athletic Union, in late 1971, to increase its maximum distance for sanctioned women's races, leading to official participation by women in marathons, beginning at Boston in 1972.[20] Kuscsik was the first woman to officially win the Boston Marathon, which occurred in 1972.[21]\n\n\nIn 1996, the B.A.A. retroactively recognized as champions the unofficial women's leaders of 1966 through 1971. In 2015, about 46 percent of the entrants were female.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rosie Ruiz, the impostor[edit]\n\n\nIn 1980, Rosie Ruiz crossed the finish line first in the women's race. However, marathon officials became suspicious, and it was discovered that she did not appear in race videotapes until near the end of the race, with a subsequent investigation concluding that she had skipped most of the race and blended into the crowd about a half-mile (800 m) from the finish line, where she then ran to her false victory. She was disqualified eight days later, and Canadian Jacqueline Gareau was proclaimed the winner.[22][23]\n\n\n\n### Participant deaths[edit]\n\n\nIn 1905, James Edward Brooks of North Adams, Massachusetts, died of pneumonia shortly after running the marathon.[24] In 1996, a 61-year-old Swedish man, Humphrey Siesage, died of a heart attack during the 100th running.[25] In 2002, Cynthia Lucero, 28, died of hyponatremia.[26]\n\n\n\n### 2011: Geoffrey Mutai and the IAAF[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Boston Marathon\n\nOn April 18, 2011, Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya won the 2011 Boston Marathon in a time of 2:03:02:00.[27] Although this was the fastest marathon ever run at the time, the International Association of Athletics Federations noted that the performance was not eligible for world record status given that the course did not satisfy rules that regarded elevation drop and start/finish separation (the latter requirement being intended to prevent advantages gained from a strong tailwind, as was the case in 2011).[28] The Associated Press (AP) reported that Mutai had the support of other runners who describe the IAAF's rules as \"flawed\".[29] According to the *Boston Herald*, race director Dave McGillivray said he was sending paperwork to the IAAF in an attempt to have Mutai's mark ratified as a world record.[27] Although this was not successful, the AP indicated that the attempt to have the mark certified as a world record \"would force the governing bodies to reject an unprecedented performance on the world's most prestigious marathon course\".[29]\n\n\n\n### 2013: Bombing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boston Marathon bombing\n\nOn April 15, 2013, the Boston Marathon was still in progress at 2:49 p.m. EDT (nearly three hours after the winner crossed the finish line), when two homemade bombs were set off about 200 yards (180 m) apart on Boylston Street, in approximately the last 225 yards (200 m) of the course. The race was halted, preventing many from finishing.[30][31] Three spectators were killed and an estimated 264 were injured.[32] Entrants who completed at least half the course and did not finish due to the bombing were given automatic entry in 2014.[33] In 2015, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the perpetrators of the bombing, was found guilty of 30 federal offenses in connection with the attack and was sentenced to death. His brother Tamerlan died after a gunfight with police and after Dzhokhar ran him over with a vehicle.[34][35]\n\n\n\n### 2014: Women's race disqualification[edit]\n\n\nBizunesh Deba of Ethiopia was eventually named women's winner of the 2014 Boston Marathon, following the disqualification of Kenyan Rita Jeptoo from the event due to confirmed doping. Deba finished in a time of 2:19:59, and became the course record holder. Her performance bested that of Margaret Okayo, who ran a time of 2:20:43 in 2002.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2016: Bobbi Gibb as grand marshal[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2016 Boston Marathon, Jami Marseilles, an American, became the first female double amputee to finish the Boston Marathon.[37][38] Bobbi Gibb, the first woman to have run the entire Boston Marathon (1966), was the grand marshal of the race.[39] The Women's Open division winner, Atsede Baysa, gave Gibb her trophy; Gibb said that she would go to Baysa's native Ethiopia in 2017 and return it to her.[40]\n\n\n\n### 2020: Cancellation[edit]\n\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Boston Marathon was initially rescheduled from April 20 to September 14.[41] It was the first postponement in the more than 100 year uninterrupted history of the event.[42]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2020, it was announced that the rescheduled marathon set for September 14 was canceled.[43] Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said of the decision to cancel the race, \"There's no way to hold this usual race format without bringing large numbers of people into close proximity. While our goal and our hope was to make progress in containing the virus and recovering our economy, this kind of event would not be responsible or realistic on September 14 or any time this year.\"[44]\n\n\nRunners were issued full refunds of entry fees.[45] Organizers later staged a \"virtual alternative\" in September 2020 as the 124th running of the marathon.[46] This was the second time that the format of the marathon was modified, the first having been in 1918, when the race was changed from a marathon to a military relay race (ekiden) because of World War I.[47]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Rescheduled to October[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Boston Marathon\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the B.A.A. announced that the 2021 edition of the marathon would not be held in April; organizers stated that they hoped to stage the event later in the year, possibly in the autumn.[48] In late January 2021, organizers announced October 11 as the date for the marathon, contingent upon road races being allowed in Massachusetts at that time.[49] In March, organizers announced that the field would be limited to 20,000 runners.[50] The race was the fourth of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all the events in the series were run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November.[51] In 2021, the B.A.A. also offered a virtual alternative to the in-person race to be completed anytime between 8-10 October.[52]\n\n\n\n## Race[edit]\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBoston Marathon   \n qualifying standards   \n (effective for 2020 race)[53]\n| Age\n | Men\n | Women\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 18–34 | 3 h 00 min | 3 h 30 min\n |\n| 35–39 | 3 h 05 min | 3 h 35 min\n |\n| 40–44 | 3 h 10 min | 3 h 40 min\n |\n| 45–49 | 3 h 20 min | 3 h 50 min\n |\n| 50–54 | 3 h 25 min | 3 h 55 min\n |\n| 55–59 | 3 h 35 min | 4 h 05 min\n |\n| 60–64 | 3 h 50 min | 4 h 20 min\n |\n| 65–69 | 4 h 05 min | 4 h 35 min\n |\n| 70–74 | 4 h 20 min | 4 h 50 min\n |\n| 75–79 | 4 h 35 min | 5 h 05 min\n |\n| ≥80 | 4 h 50 min | 5 h 20 min\n |\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon is open to runners 18 or older from any nation, but they must meet certain qualifying standards.[54] To qualify, a runner must first complete a standard marathon course certified by a national governing body affiliated with the World Athletics within a certain period of time before the date of the desired Boston Marathon (usually within approximately 18 months prior).\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, membership in USA Track & Field was required of all runners, but this requirement has been eliminated.\n\n\nQualifying standards for the 2013 race were tightened on February 15, 2011, by five minutes in each age-gender group for marathons run after September 23, 2011.[55] Prospective runners in the age range of 18–34 must run a time of no more than 3:00:00 (3 hours) if male, or 3:30:00 (3 hours 30 minutes) if female; the qualifying time is adjusted upward as age increases. In addition, the 59-second grace period on qualifying times has been completely eliminated; for example, a 40- to 44-year-old male will no longer qualify with a time of 3:10:01. For many marathoners, to qualify for Boston (to \"BQ\") is a goal and achievement in itself.[56][57]\n\n\nAn exception to the qualification times is for runners who receive entries from partners. About one-fifth of the marathon's spots are reserved each year for charities, sponsors, vendors, licensees, consultants, municipal officials, local running clubs, and marketers. In 2010, about 5,470 additional runners received entries through partners, including 2,515 charity runners.[58] The marathon currently allocates spots to two dozen charities who in turn are expected to raise more than $10 million a year.[59] In 2017, charity runners raised $34.2 million for more than 200 non-profit organizations. The Boston Athletic Association's Official Charity Program raised $17.96 million, John Hancock's Non-Profit Program raised $12.3 million, and the last $3.97 million was raised by other qualified and invitational runners.[60]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2010, the 20,000 spots reserved for qualifiers were filled in a record-setting eight hours and three minutes.[61] The speed of registration prompted the B.A.A. to change its qualifying standards for the 2013 marathon onward.[55] In addition to lowering qualifying times, the change includes a rolling application process, which gives faster runners priority. Organizers decided not to significantly adjust the number of non-qualifiers.\n\n\nOn September 27, 2018, the B.A.A. announced that they were lowering the qualifying times for the 2020 marathon by another five minutes, with male runners in the 18-34 age group required to run a time of 3:00:00 (3 hours) or less and female runners in the 18-34 age group required to run a time of 3:30:00 (3 hours, 30 minutes) or less in order to qualify.[53]\n\n\n\n### Race day[edit]\n\n\nThe race has traditionally been held on Patriots' Day,[62] a state holiday in Massachusetts, and until 1969 that was every April 19, whichever day of the week that fell on. From 1969 to 2019, the holiday was observed on the third Monday in April[63] and so the marathon date was correspondingly fixed to that Monday, often referred to by local residents as \"Marathon Monday\".[64]\n\n\n\n### Starting times[edit]\n\n\nThrough 2005, the race began at noon (wheelchair race at 11:25 a.m., and elite women at 11:31 a.m.), at the official starting point in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2006, the race used a staggered \"wave start\", where top-seeded runners (the elite men's group) and a first batch of up to 10,000 runners started at noon, with a second group starting at 12:30. The next year the starting times for the race were moved up, allowing runners to take advantage of cooler temperatures and enabling the roads to be reopened earlier. The marathon later added third and fourth waves to help further stagger the runners and reduce congestion.[65][66][67]\n\n\nThe starting times for 2019 were:[68][69]\n\n\n\n* Men's Push Rim Wheelchair: 9:02 a.m.\n* Women's Push Rim Wheelchair: 9:04 a.m.\n* Handcycles and Duos: 9:25 a.m.\n* Elite Women: 9:32 a.m.\n* Elite Men: 10 a.m.\n* Wave One: 10:02 a.m.\n* Wave Two: 10:25 a.m.\n* Wave Three: 10:50 a.m.\n* Wave Four: 11:15 a.m.\n\n\n### Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Course map\nThe course runs through 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km) of winding roads, following Route 135, Route 16, Route 30 and city streets into the center of Boston, where the official finish line is located at Copley Square, alongside the Boston Public Library. The race runs through eight Massachusetts cities and towns: Hopkinton, Ashland, Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Newton, Brookline, and Boston.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot on his way to winning the 2006 Boston Marathon, where he set a new course record.\nThe Boston Marathon is considered to be one of the more difficult marathon courses because of the Newton hills, which culminate in *Heartbreak Hill* near Boston College.[71] While the three hills on Commonwealth Avenue (Route 30) are better known, a preceding hill on Washington Street (Route 16), climbing from the Charles River crossing at 16 miles (26 km), is regarded by Dave McGillivray, the long-term race director, as the course's most difficult challenge.[72][73] This hill, which follows a 150-foot (46 m) rise over a 1⁄2 mile (800 m) stretch, forces many lesser-trained runners to a walking pace.\n\n\n\n#### Heartbreak Hill[edit]\n\n\nHeartbreak Hill is an ascent over 0.4 miles (600 m) between the 20- and 21-mile (32- and 34-km) marks, near Boston College. It is the last of four \"Newton hills\", which begin at the 16-mile (26 km) mark and challenge contestants with late (if modest) climbs after the course's general downhill trend to that point. Though Heartbreak Hill itself rises only 88 feet (27 m) vertically (from an elevation of 148 to 236 feet (45 to 72 m)),[74] it comes in the portion of a marathon distance where muscle glycogen stores are most likely to be depleted—a phenomenon referred to by marathoners as \"hitting the wall\".\n\n\nIt was on this hill that, in 1936, defending champion John A. \"Johnny\" Kelley overtook Ellison \"Tarzan\" Brown, giving him a consolatory pat on the shoulder as he passed. This gesture renewed the competitive drive in Brown, who rallied, pulled ahead of Kelley, and went on to win—thereby, it was said, breaking Kelley's heart.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participants in the 2010 Boston Marathon in Wellesley, just after the halfway mark\nBecause the course drops 459 feet (140 m) from start to finish[29] and the start is quite far west of the finish, allowing a helpful tailwind, the Boston Marathon does not satisfy two of the criteria necessary for the ratification of world[77] or American records.[78]\n\n\nAt the 2011 Boston Marathon on April 18, 2011, Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya ran a time of 2:03:02, which was the fastest ever marathon at the time (since surpassed by Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39 in Berlin 2018). However, due to the reasons listed above, Mutai’s performance was not ratified as an official world record. Bezunesh Deba from Ethiopia set the women's course record with a 2:19:59 performance on April 21, 2014. This was declared after Rita Jeptoo from Kenya was disqualified following a confirmed doping violation.[79]\n\n\nOther course records include:\n\n\n\n* Men's Masters: John Campbell (New Zealand), 2:11:04 (set in 1990)\n* Women's Masters: Firiya Sultanova-Zhdanova (Russia), 2:27:58 (set in 2002)\n* Men's Push Rim Wheelchair: Marcel Hug (Switzerland), 1:17:06 (set in 2023)\n* Women's Push Rim Wheelchair: Manuela Schär (Switzerland), 1:28:17 (set in 2017)\n* Men's Handcycle: Tom Davis (United States), 0:58:36 (set in 2017)\n* Women's Handcycle: Wendy Larsen (United States), 1:37:15 (set in 2021)\n\n\nOn only four occasions have world record times for marathon running been set in Boston.[*citation needed*] In 1947, the men's record time set was 2:25:39, by Suh Yun-Bok of South Korea. In 1975, a women's world record of 2:42:24 was set by Liane Winter of West Germany, and in 1983, Joan Benoit Samuelson of the United States ran a women's world record time of 2:22:43. In 2012 Joshua Cassidy of Canada set a men's wheelchair marathon world-record time of 1:18:25.\n\n\nIn 2007, astronaut Sunita Williams was an official entrant of the race, running a marathon distance while on the International Space Station, becoming the first person to run a marathon in space. She was sent a specialty bib and medal by the B.A.A. on the STS-117 flight of the Space Shuttle *Atlantis*.[80][81]\n\n\nThe race's organizers keep a standard time clock for all entries, though official timekeeping ceases after the six-hour mark.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## The B.A.A.[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boston Athletic Association\n\nThe *Boston Athletic Association* is a non-profit, organized sports association that organizes the Boston Marathon and other events.[3][82]\n\n\n\n## Divisions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, the Boston Marathon became the first major marathon to include a wheelchair division competition.[4] Bob Hall wrote race director Will Cloney to ask if he could compete in the race in his wheelchair. Cloney wrote back that he could not give Hall a race number, but would recognize Hall as an official finisher if he completed the race in under 3 hours and 30 minutes. Hall finished in 2 hours and 58 minutes, paving the way for the wheelchair division.[83] Ernst Van Dyk, in 2004, set a course record at 1:18.29, almost 50 minutes faster than the fastest runner.[84]\n\n\nHandcyclists have competed in the race since at least 2014. Starting in 2017, handcyclists are honored the same way runners and wheelchair racers are: with wreaths, prize money, and the playing of the men's and women's winners' national anthems.[85]\n\n\nIn addition to the push rim wheelchair division, the Boston Marathon[86] also hosts a blind/visually impaired division, and a mobility impaired program. Similar to the running divisions, a set of qualifying times has been developed for these divisions to motivate aspiring athletes and ensure competitive excellence. In 1986, the introduction of prize money at the Boston Marathon gave the push rim wheelchair division the richest prize purse in the sport. More than 1,000 people with disabilities and impairments have participated in the wheelchair division, while the other divisions have gained popularity each year.[87] In 2013, 40 blind runners participated.[88]\n\n\n\n## Memorial[edit]\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon Memorial in Copley Square, which is near the finish line, was installed to mark the one-hundredth running of the race. A circle of granite blocks set in the ground surrounds a central medallion that traces the race course and other segments that show an elevation map of the course and the names of the winners.[89][90]\n\n\n\n## Notable features[edit]\n\n\n### Spectators[edit]\n\n\nWith approximately 500,000 spectators, the Boston Marathon is New England's most widely viewed sporting event.[4] About 1,000 media members from more than 100 outlets received media credentials in 2011.[91]\n\n\nFor the entire distance of the race, thousands line the sides of the course to cheer the runners on, encourage them, and provide free water and snacks to the runners.\n\n\n\n### Scream Tunnel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Along the course at Wellesley College\nAt Wellesley College, a women's college, it is traditional for the students to cheer on the runners in what is referred to as the Scream Tunnel.[92][93] For about a quarter of a mile (400 m), the students line the course, scream, and offer kisses. \nThe Scream Tunnel is so loud runners claim it can be heard from a mile away. The tunnel is roughly half a mile (0.8 km) prior to the halfway mark of the course.[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nEvery year, the Boston Red Sox play a home game at Fenway Park, starting at 11:05 a.m. When the game ends, the crowd empties into Kenmore Square to cheer as the runners enter the final mile. This tradition started in 1903.[96] In the 1940s, the Red Sox from the American League and the Boston Braves from the National League (who moved to Milwaukee after the 1953 season) alternated yearly as to which would play the morning game. In 2007, the game between the Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was delayed until 12:18 p.m. due to heavy rain. The marathon, which had previously been run in a wide variety of weather conditions, was not delayed.[97] The 2018 game hosting the Baltimore Orioles was postponed into May due to rain,[98] while 2020 saw the game not played resulting from the pandemic.\n\n\n\n### Dick and Rick Hoyt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Team Hoyt at ~12.8 miles on the Marathon course on April 16, 2012Dick and Rick Hoyt entered the Boston Marathon 32 times.[99] Dick was the father of Rick, who had cerebral palsy. While doctors said that Rick would never have a normal life and thought that institutionalizing him was the best option, Dick and his wife disagreed and raised him at home. Eventually, a computer device was developed that helped Rick communicate with his family, and they learned that one of his biggest passions was sports. \"Team Hoyt\" (Dick and Rick) started competing in charity runs, with Dick pushing Rick in a wheelchair. Through August 2008, Dick and Rick had competed in 66 marathons and 229 triathlons. Their fastest marathon finish was 2:40:47.[*citation needed*] The team completed their 30th Boston Marathon in 2012, when Dick was 72 and Rick was 50.[100] They had intended the 2013 marathon to be their final one, but due to the Boston Marathon bombing, they were stopped a mile short of completing their run, and decided to run one more marathon the following year. They completed the 2014 marathon on April 21, 2014, having previously announced that it would be their last.[101] In tribute to his connection with the race, Dick was named the Grand Marshal of the 2015 marathon. He died in 2021, aged 80.[102] Rick died in May 2023.[103]\n\n\n### Bandits[edit]\n\n\nUnlike many other races, the Boston Marathon tolerated \"bandits\" (runners who do not register and obtain a bib number).[104] They used to be held back until after all the registered runners had left the starting line, and then were released in an unofficial fourth wave. They were generally not pulled off the course and mostly allowed to cross the finish line.[104] For decades, these unofficial runners were treated like local folk heroes, celebrated for their endurance and spunk for entering a contest with the world's most accomplished athletes.[105] Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillivray was once a teenage bandit.[106]\n\n\nGiven the increased field that was expected for the 2014 Marathon, however, organizers planned \"more than ever\" to discourage bandits from running.[107] As of September 2015 the B.A.A. website states:\n\n\n\n\n> Q: Can I run in the Boston Marathon as an unofficial or \"bandit\" runner?\n> A: No, please do NOT run if you have not been officially entered in the race. Race amenities along the course and at the finish, such as fluids, medical care, and traffic safety, are provided based on the number of expected official entrants. Any addition to this by way of unofficial participants, adversely affects our ability to ensure a safe race for everyone.[108]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Costumes[edit]\n\n\nA number of people choose to run the course in a variety of costumes each year.[109][110] During the 100th running in 1996, one runner wore a scale model of the Old North Church steeple on his back. Old North Church is where the signal was lit that set Paul Revere off on his midnight ride, which is commemorated each year on the same day as the Marathon. During the 2014 marathon, runners and spectators were discouraged from wearing \"costumes covering the face or any non-form fitting, bulky outfits extending beyond the perimeter of the body,\" for security reasons following the 2013 bombing. However, state authorities and the Boston Athletic Association did not outright ban such costumes.[111]\n\n\n\n### Ondekoza *taiko* drummers[edit]\n\n\n![A marathon runner with a red shirt playing taiko drums after finishing the marathon](image)Ondekoza member Marco Lienhard playing *taiko* after finishing the marathon\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The 700-pound (320 kg) drum would be set up at the finish line to encourage runners finishing the marathon. Bill Rodgers was a guest on Sado Island and ran marathons in Japan with Ondekoza members. The group also ran the New York City Marathon and Los Angeles Marathon, and ran 10,000 miles (16,000 km) of the perimeter of the United States from 1990 to 1993.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of winners of the Boston Marathon\n* List of marathon races in North America\n* The Sports Museum (at TD Garden)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Marathon Dates\". *BAA.org*.

Held annually since 1974,[a] the event includes multiple races over the marathon distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 mi), including elite level road running competitions for men and women, a race for the public, an inline skating race, a wheelchair race, and a handcycle race.\n\n\nEvents are split over two days, with skaters competing on the marathon course on Saturday before the running events. Power walkers, hand-bikers, wheelchair riders, and a children's marathon (4.2195 kilometres (2.6219 mi), 1/10 of the regular distance)[4] are also part of the marathon weekend, which is organised by SCC EVENTS. The elite running and wheelchair races are part of the World Marathon Majors, an annual series of top level races offering a $1 million prize purse. BMW is the current title sponsor for the race.\n\n\nThe city's flat course regularly produces fast performances: a record eight women scored times below 2:20 in the 2023 race, and a record nine men were below 2:05 and 15 finished inside 2:06.[5] The marathon world record has been broken in Berlin on thirteen occasions, particularly the most recent eight instances on the men's progression (as of September 2022[update]). The current record was set at the 2022 edition, where Eliud Kipchoge won the men's race in 2:01:09. Tigist Assefa set a new women's world record in 2023 with 2:11:53. In the wheelchair race, Catherine Debrunner (Switzerland) 2023 broke the world record in 1:34:16 hours.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eliud Kipchoge running world record (2:01:09) at the 2022 Berlin Marathon\nThe Berlin Marathon was established in 1974 by Horst Milde, a baker and running enthusiast in the city. The race had 244 finishers; 234 men and 10 women, and was won by Günter Hallas and Jutta von Haase in times of 2:44:53 and 3:22:01 respectively. In 1977, Christa Vahlensieck established a new women's world record at the Berlin Marathon, running 2:34:47. Four years later, the race started outside the Reichstag for the first time, by which time it had grown to 2,583 finishers, making it the largest city road race in Germany. The following year, before German unification, some East Germans secretly ran the race, registering under false names to avoid recriminations from the East German secret service. In 1989, a children's race was added to the event, and eight years later an inline skating marathon was contested.[7][8]\n\n\nIn 1998, Ronaldo da Costa set a new men's world record, the only South American to hold a marathon world record. Two years later, one of the race's pacemakers, Simon Biwott won the race, after one of the favourites had pulled out in the second half of the race. In 2001, Naoko Takahashi became the first woman to run a sub-2:20 marathon, completing the Berlin Marathon in 2:19:46. The race had continued to be the venue of world records; between 2003 and 2018, seven men's records were set at the race; the most recent remains as the current world record time; Eliud Kipchoge's 2:01:39.[7][8]\n\n\nThe event was held in mid-September in 2000 and 2018, because of a conflict with the Women's Olympic Marathon, and due to German Unity Day preparations, respectively.[9]\n\n\nThe 2020 edition of the event was prohibited from being held on its originally scheduled dates due to the coronavirus pandemic,[10] and was eventually cancelled once it was clear that it would not be possible to hold it at a later date in 2020.[3] All registrants were given the option of either transferring their entry to 2021 or obtaining a refund.[3]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe marathon course is set throughout several boroughs in Berlin with start and finish near the Brandenburg Gate (bottom right).\n\nThe course within the metropolis starts and finishes near the Brandenburg Gate. Due to the division of the city, the marathon events before 1990 were limited to West Berlin only. On 30 September 1990 athletes were able to run through the Brandenburg Gate for the first time and since then, the course has covered both halves of the unified city. It was reported that a great many of the runners had tears in their eyes as they ran through the gate.[11]\n\n\nNowadays, after leaving Brandenburg Gate, the course passes Charlottenburg, around Tiergarten, along Moabit and Mitte, and then south to Friedrichshain. After that, it winds west between Kreuzberg and Neukölln, through Schöneberg, over to Friedenau and Zehlendorf, before turning north back toward the city's center. Looping above Schöneberg, the course comes full circle as it finishes through the Gate.[11]\n\n\nThere have been two other major international marathons in Berlin. At the 1936 Olympic Games and at the 2009 IAAF World Championships, both using different routes. A marathon in Berlin on 14 Oct 1973 was won by Ulrich Hutmacher (GER) with a time of 2:19:32, but that race is not considered to be part of the Berlin Marathon series.\n\n\n\n## Sponsors[edit]\n\n\nThere have been several title sponsors in the race's history. From 1974 until 1989 it was just the *Berlin Marathon*. In 1990, it was the *Yanase Berlin Marathon*. In 1991 and 1992 it was the *Canon Berlin Marathon*. It reverted to simply the *Berlin Marathon* from 1993 until 1997. It then became the *Alberto Berlin Marathon* in 1998 and 1999. A new title sponsor changed the name to the *real,- Berlin Marathon* from 2000 to 2010. Since 2011 it has been called the *BMW Berlin Marathon*.\n\n\n\n## Finishers[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of finishing athletes, Berlin is one of four world-wide marathons with more than 40,000 finishers, along with the New York City Marathon, Chicago Marathon, and Paris Marathon.\n\n\n\n![](image)2009 Berlin Marathon\n![](image)World record winner Haile Gebrselassie on his way to his fourth straight

Both these athletes also hold the records for time, with Frei setting the men's race record of 1:21:39 in 1997 and Schär setting the women's race record of 1:36:53 in 2018.[15]\n\n\n**Key**:    Course record (in bold)\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Men's winner\n | Time[b] | Women's winner\n | Time[b] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981\n | ![](image) Georg Freund (FRG) | 2:08:44\n | *not held* |\n| 1982\n | ![](image) Bosse Lindquist (SWE) | 2:03:10\n |\n| 1983\n | ![](image) Gregor Golombek (FRG) | 1:55:10\n | ![](image) Gabriele Beyer (FRG) | 2:51:12\n |\n| 1984\n | ![](image) Bosse Lindquist (SWE) | 2:16:32\n | ![](image) Gabriele Beyer (FRG) | 2:47:14\n |\n| 1985\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:57:28\n | ![](image) Gabriele Schild (SUI) | 2:33:51\n |\n| 1986\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:46:44\n | ![](image) Connie Hansen (DEN) | 2:32:23\n |\n| 1987\n | ![](image) Gregor Golombek (FRG) | 1:46:52\n | ![](image) Margit Quell (FRG) | 2:21:29\n |\n| 1988\n | ![](image) Markus Pilz (FRG) | 1:52:08\n | ![](image) Gabriele Schild (SUI) | 2:52:29\n |\n| 1989\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:40:11\n | ![](image) Daniela Jutzeler (SUI) | 1:55:23\n |\n| 1990\n | ![](image) Jean-Marc Berset (SUI) | 1:34:41\n | ![](image) Daniela Jutzeler (SUI) | 1:57:47\n |\n| 1991\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:27:39\n | ![](image) Beate Meier (GER) | 1:51:50\n |\n| 1992\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:29:41\n | ![](image) Jennette Jansen (NED) | 1:42:07\n |\n| 1993\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:27:16\n | ![](image) Lily Anggreny (GER) | 1:50:34\n |\n| 1994\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:22:12\n | ![](image) Louise Sauvage (AUS) | 1:57:14\n |\n| 1995\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:22:49\n | ![](image) Lily Anggreny (GER) | 1:58:38\n |\n| 1996\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:25:34\n | ![](image) Monica Wetterström (SWE) | 1:54:00\n |\n| 1997\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | **1:21:39** | ![](image) Louise Sauvage (AUS) | 1:49:58\n |\n| 1998\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:24:19\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:47:53\n |\n| 1999\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:23:57\n | ![](image) Monica Wetterström (SWE) | 1:48:12\n |\n| 2000\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:26:30\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:52:31\n |\n| 2001\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:30:24\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:47:46\n |\n| 2002\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:28:28\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:45:52\n |\n| 2003\n | ![](image) Joël Jeannot (FRA) | 1:25:19\n | ![](image) Yvonne Sehmisch (GER) | 1:52:05\n |\n| 2004\n | ![](image) Thomas Gerlach (DEN) | 1:33:49\n | *not held* |\n| 2005\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:28:32\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:49:46\n |\n| 2006\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:29:30\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:42:52\n |\n| 2007\n | ![](image) Masazumi Soejima (JPN) | 1:26:50\n | ![](image) Simone Buess (SUI) | 1:48:50\n |\n| 2008\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:27:55\n | ![](image) Sandra Hager (SUI) | 2:04:21\n |\n| 2009\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:28:38\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:39:31\n |\n| 2010\n | ![](image) Masazumi Soejima (JPN) | 1:28:46\n | ![](image) Wakako Tsuchida (JPN) | 1:46:15\n |\n| 2011\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:31\n | ![](image) Edith Hunkeler (SUI) | 1:45:20\n |\n| 2012\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:43\n | ![](image) Sandra Graf (SUI) | 1:46:19\n |\n| 2013\n | ![](image) Heinz Frei (SUI) | 1:31:00\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:41:39\n |\n| 2014\n | ![](image) Kota Hokinoue (JPN) | 1:32:25\n | ![](image) Shelly Woods (GBR) | 1:47:56\n |\n| 2015\n | ![](image) David Weir (GBR) | 1:27:36\n | ![](image) Natalia Kocherova (RUS) | 1:50:36\n |\n| 2016\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:51\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:43:00\n |\n| 2017\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:29:03\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:40:05\n |\n| 2018\n | ![](image) Brent Lakatos (CAN) | 1:29:41\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:36:53\n |\n| 2019\n | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:28:09\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:38:07\n |\n| 2020[3] | *cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic* |\n| 2021[16] | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:24:03\n | ![](image) Manuela Schär (SUI) | 1:37:31\n |\n| 2022[17] | ![](image) Marcel Hug (SUI) | 1:24:56\n | ![](image) Catherine Debrunner (SUI) | **1:36:47** |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of marathon races in Europe\n* Sport in Berlin\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The event was cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** h:m:s\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** BERLIN-MARATHON: Zahlen und Rekorde: Die Teilnehmerzahlen 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"47.

It is one of the six World Marathon Majors.[1] Thus, it is also a World Athletics Label Road Race. The Chicago Marathon is the fourth-largest race by number of finishers worldwide.[2]\n\n\nAnnual Chicago marathons were held from 1905 to the 1920s, but the first race in the present series occurred on September 25, 1977, under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon, which drew a field of 4,200 runners. The race has been held every year since, except in 1987 when only a half-marathon was run, and in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4][5] It became among the fastest-growing modern-marathon road races in the world, due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances.[6] The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationships with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances. Since 2008, the race has been sponsored and organized by Bank of America, and is officially known as the **Bank of America Chicago Marathon**.\n\n\nThe race is limited to 45,000 runners and only runners who finish within 61⁄2 hours are officially timed.[6][7] Those wishing to participate can register after either meeting a time qualifying standard or being selected through a general lottery.[8] Although the race has limited registration, exceptions include elite runners, legacy finishers, and charity representatives.[9] Increasingly, local, national and global charities as well as humanitarian organizations encourage sponsored participation in the event as a means of fund raising.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of winners of the Chicago Marathon\n\n![](image)The former logo before the current sponsor\nThe first modern marathon at the 1896 Games of the I Olympiad in Greece generated interest in the sport which led to similar races throughout most western countries and across the United States. While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis,[12] the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race.[13] Beginning in 1905,[14] the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the *Chicago Daily News* after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)First Chicago Marathon September 23, 1905. Louis Marks in the lead.\nThe first Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905.[13] That first race began at the Evanston Golf Club and finished in front of a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park Race Track. Beginning with a little over a dozen runners, only seven completed the course.[16] In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Chicagoan Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks.[14] With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s, eventually on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route.[15] The second year, feet bleeding, Canadian Dennis Bennett won, while a band played \"Maple Leaf Forever\". In the early years, runners had their own regimens: John Lindquist from Brooklyn took a commanding lead in 1907 while doing whiskey shots, but by mile 23, he was apparently falling asleep; while, the next year, the French-born Chicagoan Albert Corey had more success sipping champagne.[16] Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.[17]\n\n\nIt was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the public's eyes. Frank Shorter's 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle-class American ideals.[18] Then the 1976 New York City Marathon, which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course, popularized the big city marathon. As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon.[3] By the mid-1980s, the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons.[19] During the mid-1980s, it was named America's Marathon/Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments. Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathons of the mid-1980s as \"The World's Marathon\".[20] The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)The founding location of the Chicago Marathon is at 214 West Erie in River North.\nThe modern era Chicago Marathon was founded over the objection of Ed Kelly, Chicago Park District Superintendent who refused permission to run in the parks or along the Lake Michigan lakefront. With the help of Lee Flaherty, the event's founder who operated out of Flair House in the Near North Side community area of Chicago,[21] Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's support for the marathon was enlisted. Although Mayor Daley died, his successor Michael Anthony Bilandic approved the race and got Kelly on board. Michael Bilandic, a runner, and his wife actually passed out medals at the first marathon on September 25, 1977. This first edition of the modern Chicago Marathon was called the Mayor Daley Marathon.[22] Flaherty footed the bill for the first race, which had no sponsors. He again footed the bill in 1978 when the race was again called the Mayor Daley Marathon. In 1979, however, Beatrice Foods became the first race sponsor.\n\n\n\n![](image)Evans Cheruiyot follows the course car (with clock) during his 2008 victory. The lead course car carries the current race time.\nIn the early years the Chicago Marathon was held in August.[23] It has from its inception with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers been one of the nation's largest marathons. The 2000 running was second only to New York.[24] The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer.[18] By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons. In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's).[18] The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. The 1985 race was spectacular with Steve Jones breaking his own course record (2 seconds short of the world record) and Joan Benoit Samuelson the 1984 Olympic Champion, two-time defending Chicago Marathon Champion and Olympic Bronze Medalist, Rosa Mota and the fourth place Olympic finisher and world record setting Ingrid Kristiansen. Benoit set a record that stood nearly a generation. At that time, it was considered the premier marathon in the United States, if not the world.[25] Although 1986 had 40 world-class runners among the 8,000 participants the times paled in comparison.[26] Beatrice dropped out as a sponsor in 1987. Because of this only a half-marathon race was held that year[5] and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988[27] and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon.[28] The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions.[29] In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned.[30] In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank.[31] In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon.[32] In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty.[33][34] In 1998, the race began using transponder timing.[35] In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women's world record marathon time, both the men's and women's then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)2007 Chicago Marathon temperatures.\nIn 2007, Bank of America acquired LaSalle Bank's parent company ABN AMRO North America in 2007 and assumed the race's title sponsorship.[37][38] The 2007 race made history with the first ever CEO Marathon Challenge. The race featured a special competition among the CEOs, presidents, company owners and c-suite executives of companies with at least $5 million in annual gross revenue ($2.5 million for women).[39] The 2007 race also made history for having three (men's, women's & men's wheelchair) of its four races decided in the final 100 meters in a day of record setting heat.[40] The race was partially shut down early (after three and a half hours) as temperatures rose to an unseasonably hot 88 °F (31 °C), which surpassed both the temperature records for the Chicago Marathon and official Chicago records for October 7.[41] Over 10,000 registrants chose not to run in the record temperatures, while 10,934 people did not finish (many were called after the course closed early for safety).[4][40][42] One runner died, over 30 were hospitalized, and over 400 others sought medical attention. Marathon owner and sponsor Bank of America, which had just acquired LaSalle Bank, has denied culpability. Similar hot conditions have been experienced in other city center races. In 2003, London's The British 10K also had extremely hot weather that affected many runners.[42][43]\n\n\nThe 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of either transferring their entry to 2021, 2022, or 2023, or obtaining a full refund.[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chicago Marathon start/finish in Grant Park, October 2006\nThe marathon course is a loop course, starting and ending at Grant Park. From there, the current course winds through 29 of the city's neighborhoods.[46] The course loop can be generally divided into three sections: North, West, and South. In each of these sections, three of the city's main stadiums are near the course's turning points: Wrigley Field to the north; the United Center to the west; and Guaranteed Rate Field to the south. The city's fourth professional stadium, Soldier Field, is located near the start/finish area.\n\n\nFor the first three miles, runners wind through Chicago's downtown area. Eventually, they head north along LaSalle Street.\n\n\nRunners are supported by over 12,000 volunteers[47] spread throughout the course including at 20 aid stations[48] located approximate every 1–3 miles.[49] For runners in distress, aid station volunteers include medical staff and ambulatory services are scattered throughout the course.\n\n\nDigital timers are positioned every 5 kilometers, as well as the halfway point.\n\n\n\n\n## Runner statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nChicago Marathon Finishers (2000–present)  \n Total finishers and by gender\n| Year\n | Finishers\n | Avg Finish Time\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | Male\n | Female\n |\n| 2000 | 27,870\n | 16,802\n | 11,068\n | 4:21:46\n |\n| 2001 | 28,390\n | 17,129\n | 11,261\n | 4:19:28\n |\n| 2002 | 31,093\n | 18,111\n | 12,982\n | 4:19:51\n |\n| 2003 | 32,395\n | 18,720\n | 13,675\n | 4:25:09\n |\n| 2004 | 33,033\n | 19,073\n | 13,960\n | 4:26:53\n |\n| 2005 | 32,995\n | 18,673\n | 14,322\n | 4:26:22\n |\n| 2006 | 33,618\n | 18,904\n | 14,714\n | 4:25:02\n |\n| 2007 | 28,815\n | 16,945\n | 11,870\n | 4:52:11\n |\n| 2008 | 31,343\n | 17,675\n | 13,668\n | 4:46:30\n |\n| 2009 | 33,475\n | 18,983\n | 14,492\n | 4:27:20\n |\n| 2010 | 36,159\n | 19,973\n | 16,186\n | 4:43:48\n |\n| 2011 | 35,670\n | 20,256\n | 15,414\n | 4:40:34\n |\n| 2012 | 37,455\n | 20,688\n | 16,767\n | 4:32:02\n |\n| 2013 | 39,122\n | 21,618\n | 17,504\n | 4:32:23\n |\n| 2014 | 40,801\n | 22,299\n | 18,502\n | 4:33:03\n |\n| 2015 | 37,182\n | 20,144\n | 17,038\n | 4:33:14\n |\n| 2016 | 40,608\n | 22,045\n | 18,563\n | 4:34:48\n |\n| 2017 | 44,508\n | 22,906\n | 21,602\n | 4:47:23\n |\n| 2018 | 44,584\n | 23,934\n | 20,650\n | 4:34:01\n |\n| 2019 | 45,956\n | 24,626\n | 21,330\n | 4:29:51\n |\n| 2020\n | *cancelled in pandemic*[44] |\n| 2021 | 26,112\n | 14,228\n | 11,884\n | 4:42:32\n |\n| 2022 | 39,420\n | 20,931\n | 18,489\n | 4:29:09\n |\n| 2023 | 48,574\n | 25,858\n | 22,626\n | 4:21:03\n |\n| Source:[50]|[51]|[52]|[53]\"Chicago Marathon Race Results 2023\". *www.marathonguide.com*. Retrieved October 11, 2023. |\n\n\nThe Bank of America Chicago Marathon has grown significantly from its beginnings. In 1905, 20 runners registered for the first Chicago Marathon, 15 actually started the race, and 7 finished.[17] For the first \"modern\" marathon race in 1977, 4,200 people took part.[54] In 1995, 9,000 people registered, and in 1999, over 29,000 people registered. The 2001 marathon run on October 7 reached its cap of 37,500, which was instituted after the 2000 race drew 33,171 runners,[55] just prior to the entry deadline on September 19.[56] In 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 it reached its cap of 40,000.[3][57] The October 10, 2004, October 9, 2005 and October 22, 2006 races reached their 40,000 entrant caps on August 16, July 14, and May 26 respectively.[57][58][59] On April 18, 2007, the 2007 race run on October 7 reached its cap of 45,000 entrants.[60] There was a late registration exemption whereby elite runners (marathon times of less than 2:31/3:01 or half marathon times of 1:11/1:21 for (men/women)) could register until September 1 even though the race had reached its registration cap in the spring.[61] The 40,000 registrants and 33,000 finishers in 2003 made the Chicago Marathon the third or fourth largest marathon depending on which metric (registrants or finishers) is used.[62]\n\n\nThe Chicago Marathon has never excluded women. Historically, however, the women's field has been smaller than the men's. This seems to be the result of older age categories having large multiples of men to women, but the women are beginning to outnumber the men in the 20s age group of the field.[63]\n\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\nWorld records have been broken at Chicago six times.[64] In 1984, Steve Jones broke the world record with 2:08:05. In 1999, Khalid Khannouchi was the first to surpass 2:06:00 with 2:05:42. \n\n\nThe men's course record was broken in the 2013 race by Dennis Kimetto with a time of 2:03:45.[65] On October 8, 2023, Kelvin Kiptum set a new world record, and therefore also the Chicago course record, completing the course in 2:00:35.[66]\n\n\nThe women's record was broken in two consecutive years. In 2001, Catherine Ndereba broke the record in 2:18:47, and Paula Radcliffe surpassed that mark with 2:17:18 the year after. In 2019, Brigid Kosgei won in a world record time of 2:14:04, which was surpassed in 2023 by Sifan Hassan setting a new course record of 2:13:44.[67]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic impact[edit]\n\n\nMuch of the marathon's impact is derived from the tourism industry. More than 10,000 of the runners in 2010 indicated that it was their first visit to Chicago. Of that, 6,000 came from 100 countries. Due to the travelers, the event increases hotel occupancy rates during the marathon. According to an independent study by the University of Illinois, the 2015 marathon contributed an estimated US$277 million worth of activity to the Chicago economy, equivalent to 1,948 jobs.[68]\n\n\n\n### Charity program[edit]\n\n\nSince the charity program was officially established in 2002, more than 106,000 runners have raised over $207 million for local, national and global causes.[69]\n\n\nCharity fundraising is now closely intertwined with the event as the runners now raise money for research, aid the suffering and heighten public awareness of different causes.[70] The marathon offers all registered entrants the opportunity to fundraise for a charity partner. The marathon recognizes four levels of charities based on the number of participants recruited, and fundraising levels.[71]\n\n\nRunners can also opt out of the public lottery or obtain a guaranteed place after this has been drawn by choosing to run for an official charity. The 2016 event had over 170 charity partners, and raised more than US$16.9 million.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2005 LaSalle Bank ABN Amro Chicago Marathon at Grand Avenue passing under Michigan Avenue (Chicago) along the Magnificent Mile.\n\n\n| Year\n | Charity count\n | Charity runner count\n | Funds raised\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | 7 | — | —\n |\n| 2002\n | 14 | 1,674 | $2,950,000\n |\n| 2003\n | 19 | 2,527 | $4,540,000\n |\n| 2004\n | 29 | 2,449 | $4,740,000\n |\n| 2005\n | 43 | 3,000 | $6,317,000\n |\n| 2006\n | 60 | 4,500 | $9,500,000\n |\n| 2007\n | 85 | 6,600 | $9,985,482\n |\n| 2008\n | 110 | 6,745 | $9,209,000\n |\n| 2009\n | 123 | 8,768 | $10,183,855\n |\n| 2010\n | 150 | 9,842 | $12,109,000\n |\n| 2011\n | 162 | 10,192 | $13,400,000\n |\n| 2012\n | 170 | 10,693 | $15,300,000\n |\n| 2013\n | 140 | 10,712 | $15,000,000\n |\n| 2014\n | 195 | 9,107 | $17,300,000\n |\n| 2015\n | 172 | 9,549 | $18,700,000[73] |\n| 2016\n | 170+ | 9,313 | $16,900,000[72] |\n| 2017\n | 180 | 10,525 | $18,500,000[74] |\n| 2018\n | 170 | 11,625 | $22,700,000[69] |\n| 2019\n | 172 | 12,000+ | $27,100,000[75] |\n| Source: 2015 Chicago Marathon Media Guide[76] |\n\n\n## Deaths[edit]\n\n\n* 1998 – Kelly Barrett, 43, Littleton, Colorado – Believed to be caused by hyponatremia[23][77]\n* 2000 – Danny Towns, 45, Edmond, Oklahoma – Cardiac arrest[23][78]\n* 2001 – Luke Roach, 22, Seattle, Washington – Collapsed near finish line.
