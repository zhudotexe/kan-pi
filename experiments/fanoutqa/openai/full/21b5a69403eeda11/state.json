You can help by updating items to more recent figures from official sources.\n\n![](image)Cartogram of the world's population in 2018; each square represents 500,000 people.\nThis is a **list of countries and dependencies by population**. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and dependencies by population density and List of regional organizations by population\n\nFigures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2022 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\n\nBecause the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union,[a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2]\n\n\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population[edit]\n\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Country / Dependency | Population | % ofworld | Date | Source (official or

sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.51% of the world's population \u2014 see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface\uff08TGM\uff09table\". European Commission.\n2. **^** Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n3. **^** Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. According to UN estimates, India is set to surpass China by the end of Apr 2023.[6]\n4. **^** Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n5. **^** Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n6. **^** Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula part of Ukraine's territory.\n7. **^** Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n8. **^** Excludes the 3 British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The 4 not listed are *British Antarctic Territory* (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n9. **^** Includes Zanzibar.\n10. **^** Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's *de jure* territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n11. **^** Excludes the disputed territory of Western Sahara (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic).\n12. **^** Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island.\n13. **^** Taiwan includes Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and other minor islands.\n14. **^** Includes Somaliland.\n15. **^** Excludes the three constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean Sea (Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Sint Maarten), but includes the three special municipalities of the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba).\n16. **^** Includes East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's administrative control is limited to approximately 20% of the territory, with the remaining 80% of the territory occupied by Morocco. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara is the United Nations peacekeeping mission to the territory (see Western Sahara conflict).\n27. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Cyprus.\n28. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Moldova.\n29. **^** The political status of Abkhazia is disputed. Having unilaterally declared independence from Georgia in 1992, Abkhazia is formally recognised as an independent state by 5 UN member states (two other states previously recognised it but then withdrew their recognition), while the remainder of the international community recognizes it as as *de jure* Georgian territory. Georgia continues to claim the area as its own territory, designating it as Russian-occupied territory.\n30. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Azerbaijan. Artsakh has announced its intention to dissolve all state institutions and cease to exist by 1 January 2024.[193]\n31. **^** South Ossetia's status is disputed.

As of 2022[update], Chinese state media reported the country's total fertility rate to be 1.09.[4]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2\u00a0billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n\n\n### Population control[edit]\n\n\nSee also: One-child policy and Two-child policy\n\n![](image)Birth rate in China\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963\u201366 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.\n\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"barefoot doctors\" distributed information and contraceptives to people's commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2\u00a0billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted[*by whom?*] to be sterilized.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10\u00a0million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234\u00a0million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot\u00a0stop\u00a0the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population.[22] On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China. For the rapid reduction of marriage and fertility, the central government should establish the policy to deal with the high house price.[23]\n\n\n\n### Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the year 2000\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe\u2013Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949\u20132022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958\u201360).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the *w\u01cen x\u012b sh\u01ceo* (\"\u665a\u3001\u7a00\u3001\u5c11\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChina exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025\u20132030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).[30]\n\n\nThe 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and\n1.44 in rural areas).[31]\nThe five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai\n(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest\nfertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui\n(1.48).[31]\n\n\nTotal fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).[32]\n\n\nIn 2022, the TFR was 1.09.[4]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.[33]\nThe World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71\u00a0million.[34]\n\n\n\n### Height and weight[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5\u00a0ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women's average height was 158 centimeters (5\u00a0ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4\u00a0lbs, or 11 stone 0\u00a0lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5\u00a0lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1\u00a0lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47 \u00a0in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31\u00a0in) respectively from 5 years earlier.[35]\n\n\n\n### Gender balance[edit]\n\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41\u00a0billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8\u00a0million of China's population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16\u00a0million, 1.28%), Manchu (10\u00a0million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9\u00a0million, 0.78%), Hui (9\u00a0million, 0.71%), Miao (8\u00a0million, 0.71%), Yi (7\u00a0million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75\u00a0million, 0.63%), Mongols (5\u00a0million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5\u00a0million, 0.43%), Buyei (3\u00a0million, 0.23%), and Korean (2\u00a0million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China.[37] Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of China according to ethnic

Migration in China and Chinese emigration\n\nInternal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization.[67] In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622\u00a0million in 2009. Of the 440\u00a0million increase, about 340\u00a0million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\"[68] Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system.[69] In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.[70]\n\n\nIn 2011 a total of 252.78\u00a0million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63\u00a0million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15\u00a0million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).[71] Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people.[72] This population of migrants would represent \"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\" a number which is almost three times the current level.[72][73] While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\"[74] China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.[75]\n\n\nThe mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora,[76] which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called \"coolies\" by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban construction work in Guangshui, 2013\nMain article: Urbanization in China\n\nUrbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2014, 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[78]\nNo statistics have been included for areas currently governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It is worthwhile to note that this does not include other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of national ancestral gods or the gods of nature (which in northern China is more common than ancestor worship), and Taoism and Confucianism.\n2. **^** Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups.\n3. **^** The map represents the geographic diffusion of the tradition of folk religious movements of salvation, Confucian churches and *jiaohua* (\"transformative teachings\") movements, based on historical data and contemporary fieldwork. Due to incomplete data and ambiguous identity of many of these traditions the map may not be completely accurate. Sources include a *World Religion Map* from Harvard University, based on data from the World Religion Database, showing highly unprecise ranges of Chinese folk (salvationist) religions' membership by province. Another source, the studies of China's Regional Religious System, find \"very high activity of popular religion and secret societies and low Buddhist presence in northern regions, while very high Buddhist presence in the southeast\".[44]\n[note 2]\n\n\t* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois[45] testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their \"energetic revival since the 1970s\" (p.\u00a013), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.\n\t* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)[46] Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p.\u00a07) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (\"Order of Heaven\") sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).\n\t* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).[47] Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.\n\t* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One (\u7688\u4f9d\u9053 *Gu\u012by\u012bd\u00e0o*), the Way of Unity (\u4e00\u8cab\u9053 *Y\u012bgu\u00e0nd\u00e0o*), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.[48]\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,[49] about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.\n4. **^** The statistics for Chinese ancestorism, that is the worship of ancestor-gods within the lineage system, are from the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2010.[43] The statistics for Buddhism and Christianity are from the China Family Panel Studies survey of 2012.[51] The statistics for Islam are from a survey conducted in 2010.[52] It is worthwhile to note that the populations of Chinese ancestorism and Buddhism may overlap, even with the large remaining parts of the population whose belief is not documented in the table. The latter, the uncharted population, may practise other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of gods, Taoism, Confucianism and folk salvationisms, or may be atheist. Indeed, according to the CFPS 2012, only 6.3% of the Chinese were irreligious in the sense of \"atheism\", while the rest practised the worship of gods and ancestors.[53]:\u200a13\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.

India overtook China to become the most populous country at the end of April 2023.[7] As of the UN data released in April 2023,[8] India has surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation. According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[9] its population is set to reach 1.7\u00a0billion by 2050.[10][11] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\nIndia has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[16] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[17] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India.[18] They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[19]\n\n\nThe sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[20] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic history of India\n\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\n### Prehistory to early 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Estimates of historical world population\n\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820.

Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[32] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[24][26] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[24][26]\n\n\nUnder the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[32] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[33] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[34] and contemporary Europe[34] up until the 19th century.[35] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[34] and Paolo Malanima[35] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[36]\n\n\nUnder the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556\u20131605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[37] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[38] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551\u20131621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[34] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[34] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[39] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[40] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658\u20131707).[37]\n\n\n\n### Late

Suggestions that it was the benefits of colonialism are refuted by academic thinking: \"There can be no serious, informed belief\u2026 that\u2026 late colonial era mortality diminished and population grew rapidly because of improvements in income, living standards, nutrition, environmental standards, sanitation or health policies, nor was there a cultural transformation\u2026\".[47]\n\n\n\n## Salient features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crude birth rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 people, national average)[48][49][50]\n![](image)Infant mortality rate trends in India  \n(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average)\nIndia occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population.

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that a birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be due to natural factors, such as the age of mother at the baby's birth, the age of father at conception, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, and others.[79] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to birth sex ratios (870\u2013930 girls to 1000 boys) observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios (below 900 girls to 1000 boys) observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Population within

ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[122][123] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[18] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[124]\n\n\nFor a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries) see South Asian ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nLinguistic groups in India chart[125][126]\n\n\n\nIndo-Aryan (75%)\nDravidian (20%)\nKolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai and others (5%)\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia\n\n### Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\n[127]\n\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[128]\n\n\n\n* H ~ 30%\n* R1a ~ 34%\n* R2 ~ 15%\n* L ~ 10%\n* NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)\n* Other Haplogroups 15%\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA[edit]\n\n\n[129]\n\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[130]\n\n\n\n* Haplogroup M ~ 60%\n* Haplogroup UK ~ 15%\n* Haplogroup N ~ 25% (Excluding UK)\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tripuri children preparing for a dance performance. The Tripuris are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.\nNumerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.\n\n\n\n* In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder *et al*. have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that \"(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities.\"[131]\n* In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins *et al*., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia.[132][133]\n* Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins *et al*. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.[133]\n* In 2006, Sahoo *et al*. reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.[134][135]\n* The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[132]\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nReligion in Indonesia (2022)[20]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.02%)\nChristianity (10.49%)\nHinduism (1.69%)\nBuddhism (0.73%)\nFolk/Other (0.04%)\nConfucianism (0.03%)\n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2022 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.02% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.49% Christians (7.43% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.69% Hindu, 0.73% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.04% other faiths.[20] Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[21] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[22]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Indonesia\n\nIndonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[23] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[24][25] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[26]\n\n\n\n## Literacy[edit]\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n  \n*total population:* 92.81%\n  \n*male:* 95.5%\n  \n*female:* 90.4% (2011 est.)\n\n\nEducation is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2016\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook,[27] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n**Age structure**\n\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 23.33%\n*15-64 years:* 70.72%\n*65 years and over:* 5.95% (2020 census)[28][29]\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n*total:* 31.1 years\n*male:* 30.5 years\n*female:* 31.8 years (2020 est.)\n**Birth rate**\n\n\n\n15.32 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Death rate**\n\n\n\n6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Population growth rate**\n\n\n\n1.097% (2010 est.)\n1.04% (2012 est.)\n0.86% (2017 est.)\n0.79% (2022 est.)\n**Urbanization**\n\n\n\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 0.4% (2017 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 630,000 (2017 est.)\nHIV/AIDS deaths: 39,000 (2017 est.)\n**Obesity \u2013 adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n6.9% (2016)\n**Children under the age of 5 years underweight**\n\n\n\n19.9% (2013)\n**Nationality**\n\n\n\n*noun:* Indonesian(s)\n*adjective:* Indonesian\n*Ethnic groups:* Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)\n**Religions**\n\n\n\nMuslim 86.7%, Christianity 10.72% (Protestant 7.6% and Roman Catholic 3.12%), Hinduism 1.74%, other 0.8% (includes Buddhist and Confucian), unspecified 0.04% (2018 est.)\n**Languages**\n\n\n\nIndonesian (official, a form of Malay influenced by other languages of Indonesia), local languages (the most widely spoken of which is Javanese).\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n*total:* 11 years\n*male:* 12 years\n*female:* 11 years (2005)\n**Education expenditures**\n\n\n\n2.8% of GDP (2014)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Census in Indonesia\n* Culture of Indonesia\n* Native Indonesians\n* Overseas Indonesian\n* Transmigration program\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020\" (PDF) (in Indonesian).

AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan's census data is yet to be approved by CCI Council of Pakistan. Pakistan is the world's fifth most populous country.[6]\n\n\nBetween 1951 and 2017, Pakistan's population expanded over sixfold, going from 33.7\u00a0million to 207.7\u00a0million. The country has a relatively high, although declining, growth rate supported by high birth rates and low death rates. Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual population growth rate stood at +2.40%.\n\n\nDramatic social changes have led to urbanisation and the emergence of two megacities: Karachi and Lahore. The country's urban population more than tripled between 1981 and 2017 (from 23.8\u00a0million to 75.7\u00a0million), as Pakistan's urbanisation rate rose from 28.2% to 36.4%. Even with this, the nation's urbanisation rate remains one of the lowest in the world, and in 2017, over 130 million Pakistanis (making up nearly 65% of the population) lived in rural areas.\n\n\nDue to a high fertility rate, estimated at 3.5 in 2022, Pakistan has one of the world's youngest populations. The 2017 census recorded that 40.3% of the country's population was under the age of 15, while only 3.7% of Pakistanis were aged 65 or more.[2] The median age of the country was 19,[2] while its sex ratio was recorded to be 105 males per 100 females.[3]\n\n\nThe demographic history of Pakistan from the ancient Indus Valley civilisation to the modern era includes the arrival and settlement of many cultures and ethnic groups in the modern region of Pakistan from Eurasia and the nearby Middle East. Because of this, Pakistan has a multicultural, multilinguistic, and multiethnic society. Despite Urdu being Pakistan's lingua franca, estimates on how many languages are spoken in the country range from 75 to 85,[7][8] and in 2017, the country's three largest ethnolinguistic groups were the Punjabis (making up 38.8% of the total population), the Pashtuns (18.2%), and the Sindhis (14.6%).[9] Pakistan is also thought to have the world's fourth-largest refugee population, estimated at 1.4\u00a0million in mid-2021 by the UNHCR.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Census in Pakistan\n\n\n\nHistorical Population of Pakistan (four provinces and Islamabad)| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  1951  | 33,740,167 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  1961  | 42,880,378 | +2.43% |\n|  1972  | 65,309,340 | +3.90% |\n|  1981  | 84,253,644 | +2.87% |\n|  1998  | 132,352,279 | +2.69% |\n|  2017  | 207,684,626 | +2.40% |\n|  2023  | 241,492,917 | +2.55% |\n| Source: [3][11] |\n\n\nThe 2017 census recorded a population of 207,684,626 living in Pakistan's four provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory.[3] The census also reported that Azad Kashmir's population stood at 4,045,367[4] and Gilgit-Baltistan's population was 1,492,924.[5] This meant that the total population of Pakistan in 2017 was 213,222,917.\n\n\nThe statistics in the graphs below were created by the United Nations in July 2022,[6] and are covered in more detail in the following section. This data includes Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.For years, the country with a population exceeding 230 million has been grappling to achieve economic stability. The people of Pakistan are living in a precarious situation, with an uncertain future in the country.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

They prepared estimates of Pakistan's population for every year from 1950 to 2021, as well as projections for future decades.[6] This data includes Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\n\nProjections are highlighted in light yellow, and future figures are taken from the medium fertility variant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Population | % Populationaged 0 to 14\n | % Populationaged 15 to 64\n | % Populationaged 65 or more\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\n | 37,696,264\n | 40.5%\n | 54.0%\n | 5.5%\n |\n| 1955\n |  | 40.3%\n | 55.3%\n | 4.4%\n |\n| 1960\n | 45,954,226\n | 40.6%\n | 55.6%\n | 3.7%\n |\n| 1965\n | 51,841,626\n | 42.3%\n | 54.4%\n | 3.4%\n |\n| 1970\n | 59,290,872\n | 43.7%\n | 53.0%\n | 3.3%\n |\n| 1975\n | 68,126,999\n | 43.9%\n | 52.8%\n | 3.4%\n |\n| 1980\n | 80,624,057\n | 43.0%\n | 53.5%\n | 3.4%\n |\n| 1985\n | 97,121,552\n | 43.0%\n | 53.5%\n | 3.5%\n |\n| 1990\n | 115,414,069\n | 43.7%\n | 52.8%\n | 3.5%\n |\n| 1995\n | 133,117,476\n | 44.4%\n | 52.1%\n | 3.5%\n |\n| 2000\n | 154,369,924\n | 42.9%\n | 53.6%\n | 3.5%\n |\n| 2005\n | 174,372,098\n | 41.1%\n | 55.4%\n | 3.5%\n |\n| 2010\n | 194,454,498\n | 39.2%\n | 57.0%\n | 3.7%\n |\n| 2015\n | 210,969,298\n | 38.4%\n | 57.7%\n | 3.9%\n |\n| 2020\n | 227,196,741\n | 37.3%\n | 58.6%\n | 4.2%\n |\n| 2025\n | 249,948,885\n | 35.3%\n | 60.2%\n | 4.5%\n |\n| 2030\n | 274,029,836\n | 33.2%\n | 61.9%\n | 4.9%\n |\n| 2035\n | 298,432,780\n | 31.7%\n | 63.1%\n | 5.2%\n |\n| 2040\n | 322,595,767\n | 29.5%\n | 64.8%\n | 5.7%\n |\n| 2045\n | 345,818,945\n | 28.1%\n | 65.8%\n | 6.2%\n |\n| 2050\n | 367,808,468\n | 26.6%\n | 66.5%\n | 6.9%\n |\n\n\n### Structure of population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Median Age of each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nThe table below shows Pakistan's population structure by five-year age group and sex using data from the 2017 census.[2] The country's population structure is relatively young, with a median age of 19. With low death rates and a declining birth rate, the country is in the third stage of its Demographic transition. In 2017, Pakistan's sex ratio stood at 105 males per 100 females,[3] which is much more balanced than South Asia as a whole.\n\n\nThe statistics below do not contain Azad Kashmir or Gilgit-Baltistan, which disseminate their census data separately from Pakistan's four provinces and Islamabad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Sex ratio | Percent\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 106,318,22\n | 101,344,632\n | 207,684,626\n | 104.9\n | 100.0%\n |\n| 0 \u2013 4\n | 14,944,124\n | 14,218,866\n | 29,162,990\n | 105.1\n | 14.0%\n |\n| 5 \u2013 9\n | 15,642,725\n | 14,383,593\n | 30,026,318\n | 108.8\n | 14.5%\n |\n| 10 \u2013 14\n | 12,946,871\n | 11,580,317\n | 24,527,188\n | 111.8\n | 11.8%\n |\n| 15 \u2013 19\n | 11,095,138\n | 10,269,213\n | 21,366,618\n | 108.0\n | 10.3%\n |\n| 20 \u2013 24\n | 9,245,010\n | 9,247,936\n | 18,495,895\n | 100.0\n | 8.9%\n |\n| 25 \u2013 29\n | 7,936,382\n | 8,461,628\n | 16,401,132\n | 93.8\n | 7.9%\n |\n| 30 \u2013 34\n | 6,945,532\n | 7,203,496\n | 14,151,748\n | 96.4\n | 6.8%\n |\n| 35 \u2013 39\n | 6,088,144\n | 5,958,164\n | 12,048,811\n | 102.2\n | 5.8%\n |\n| 40 \u2013 44\n | 4,847,522\n | 4,777,667\n | 9,627,067\n | 101.5\n | 4.6%\n |\n| 45 \u2013 49\n | 4,060,698\n | 3,869,277\n | 7,931,616\n | 104.9\n | 3.8%\n |\n| 50 \u2013 54\n | 3,643,706\n | 3,300,645\n | 6,945,580\n | 110.4\n | 3.3%\n |\n| 55 \u2013 59\n | 2,647,127\n | 2,326,991\n | 4,974,986\n | 113.8\n | 2.4%\n |\n| 60 \u2013 64\n | 2,247,341\n | 2,063,695\n | 4,311,861\n | 108.9\n | 2.1%\n |\n| 65 \u2013 69\n | 1,557,733\n | 1,393,718\n | 2,952,013\n | 111.8\n | 1.4%\n |\n| 70 \u2013 74\n | 1,131,916\n | 1,001,805\n | 2,134,220\n | 113.0\n | 1.0%\n |\n| 75 or more\n | 1,338,251\n | 1,287,621\n | 2,626,523\n | 103.9\n | 1.26%\n |\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Sex ratio | Percent\n |\n| 0 \u2013 14\n | 43,533,720\n | 40,182,776\n | 83 716 496\n | 108.3\n | 40.3%\n |\n| 15 \u2013 64\n | 58,778,374\n | 57,478,712\n | 116,257,086\n | 102.3\n | 56.0%\n |\n| 65+\n | 4,027,900\n | 3,683,144\n | 7,711,044\n | 109.4\n | 3.7%\n |\n\n\n### Population distribution[edit]\n\n\nPakistan's population is distributed unevenly, with over half of the country's people living in the Punjab province. On the other hand, Balochistan, which is geographically Pakistan's largest province, is its least-populated. The population is mainly clustered around the most agriculturally fertile areas, particularly the Indus River and its tributaries. Most of the country's people live in rural areas, but two large and growing megacities exist: the coastal Karachi and Lahore in eastern Punjab. Numerous smaller cities (such as Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, and the capital Islamabad) dot the rest of the country.\n\n\n\n#### By province[edit]\n\n\nThe table below shows Pakistan's provinces and territories by their historical population. While every one of Pakistan's administrative units currently has a growing population, the pace of growth is uneven throughout the country due to differing levels of fertility, mortality, as well as domestic and international migration. Populations pertaining to the modern borders of provinces are shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Province or Territory\n | 1951[11] | 1961[11] | 1972[11] | 1981[11] | 1998[11] | 2017[3] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Punjab | 20,540,762\n | 25,463,974\n | 37,607,423\n | 47,292,441\n | 73,691,290\n | 109,989,655\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sindh | 6,047,748\n | 8,367,065\n | 14,155,909\n | 19,028,666\n | 30,439,893\n | 47,854,510\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Khyber Pakhtunkhwa | 5,888,550\n | 7,578,186\n | 10,879,781\n | 13,259,875\n | 20,919,976\n | 35,501,964\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Balochistan | 1,167,167\n | 1,353,484\n | 2,428,678\n | 4,332,376\n | 6,565,885\n | 12,335,129\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ICT | \u2014\n | 117,669\n | 237,549\n | 340,286\n | 805,235\n | 2,003,368\n |\n| Four Provinces and ICT\n | 33,740,167\n | 42,880,378\n | 65,309,340\n | 84,253,644\n | 132,352,279\n | 207,684,626\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Azad Kashmir[4] | 886,000\n | 1,065,000\n | 1,573,000\n | 1,983,465\n | 2,972,501\n | 4,045,367\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Gilgit-Baltistan[5] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 884,000\n | 1,492,924\n |\n| Total Pakistan\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 136,208,780\n | 213,222,917\n |\n\n\n#### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows how Pakistan has urbanised. As is true with population growth, urbanisation is an uneven and nonlinear process. With an urbanisation rate of 51.9% as of 2017, Sindh is the country's most urbanised province, and is even more urban than Islamabad Capital Territory. This is largely fuelled by the growth of Karachi, which economically dominates the province and attracts migrants from the rest of the country. On the other hand, the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan both share very low urbanisation rates of 16.5%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Province or Territory\n | 1951[11] | 1961[11] | 1972[11] | 1981[11] | 1998[11] | 2017[3] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Punjab | 17.3%\n | 21.5%\n | 24.4%\n | 27.6%\n | 31.3%\n | 36.9%\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sindh | 29.2%\n | 37.9%\n | 40.4%\n | 43.3%\n | 48.8%\n | 51.9%\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Khyber Pakhtunkhwa | 8.6%\n | 10.3%\n | 11.1%\n | 12.6%\n | 14.3%\n | 16.5%\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Balochistan | 12.4%\n | 16.9%\n | 16.5%\n | 15.6%\n | 23.9%\n | 27.6%\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ICT | 0.0%\n | 0.0%\n | 32.3%\n | 60.1%\n | 65.7%\n | 50.4%\n |\n| Four Provinces and ICT\n | 17.7%\n | 22.5%\n | 25.4%\n | 28.3%\n | 32.5%\n | 36.4%\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Azad Kashmir[4] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 8.1%\n | 12.5%\n | 17.4%\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Gilgit-Baltistan[5] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 16.8%\n | 16.5%\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0ICT | 0.0%\n | 0.0%\n | 32.3%\n | 60.1%\n | 65.7%\n | 50.4%\n |\n\n\n#### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Pakistan by population\n\nAs urbanisation has progressed and owing to the country's large population, Pakistan today has many very large urban centers which act as hubs for commerce and culture. The nation has two megacities, Karachi and Lahore. With populations of 14.9\u00a0million and 11.1\u00a0million respectively (in 2017), they are among the world's largest metropolises. The country also has seven more cities with more than 1 million residents each: Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Peshawar, Multan, Hyderabad, and Islamabad. All of them play a significant role in the country, housing nearly 14 million people altogether. Aside from these, there are 103 more cities in the country with populations of at least 100,000.\n\n\nBelow a list showing Pakistan's twenty largest cities as of the 2017 census can be found, which not only shows the current populations of the cities, but also their growth rates and locations. The full list can be found on the main article: List of cities in Pakistan by population.\n\n\nAll city population figures below include adjacent cantonments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| City Name\n | Province or Territory\n | 2017 Population[13] | 1998 Population[11] | Avg.

The United Nations estimated that in February 2021, only 42% of births in Pakistan were officially registered, making it the world's most populous country where more than half of births remained unregistered.[14] The United Nations was unable to estimate how many deaths were officially registered.[14]\n\n\n\n### Estimates based on surveys[edit]\n\n\nSurveys taken by the Pakistani government or intergovernmental organisations are seen as the most reliable method of keeping tabs on birth, death, fertility, and infant mortality rates in a country without a reliable vital registration system. The data recorded in these surveys is used by the United Nations in order to estimate historical and future fertility and mortality figures for Pakistan in the World Population Prospects.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Survey\n | Crude birth rate | Crude death rate | Infant mortality rate | Total fertility rate | Life expectancy |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Urban\n | Rural\n | Total\n | Male\n | Female\n |\n| DHS 2006\u201307[16] | 30.7\n | \u2014\n | 78\n | 3.30\n | 4.49\n | 4.08\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| PSLM 2007\u201308[17] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 69\n | 3.13\n | 4.41\n | 3.95\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| PSLM 2011\u201312[18] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 63\n | 3.26\n | 4.35\n | 3.95\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| DHS 2012\u201313[19] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 74\n | 3.16\n | 4.20\n | 3.84\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| PSLM 2013\u201314[20] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 65\n | 3.24\n | 4.35\n | 3.95\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| DHS 2017\u201318[21] | 29\n | \u2014\n | 62\n | 2.93\n | 3.94\n | 3.56\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| PSLM 2018\u201319[22] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 60\n | 3.01\n | 4.21\n | 3.75\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n| PMMS 2019[23] | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | 64.3\n | 66.5\n |\n| PDS 2020[24] | 27\n | 6.7\n | 56\n | 3.07\n | 4.11\n | 3.72\n | 64.5\n | 65.5\n |\n\n\n#### Regional fertility rates[edit]\n\n\nMany of the surveys above also recorded fertility rate data broken down by each of Pakistan's administrative units, while many more surveys have been taken explicitly focusing on a specific province or territory.

This group is dwindling because of its age. The second-largest group of foreign-born residents consists of refugees from Afghanistan who are expected to leave Pakistan by the end of 2018.[49] There are also smaller groups of Muslim immigrants from countries such as Burma, Bangladesh, Iraq, Somalia, Iran, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, among others.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Year | Population | Foreign born | Percentage foreign born\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960 | 46,259,000 | 6,350,296 | 13.73%\n |\n| 1970 | 59,565,000 | 5,105,556 | 8.57%\n |\n| 1980 | 79,297,000 | 5,012,524 | 6.32%\n |\n| 1990 | 111,698,000 | 6,555,782 | 5.87%\n |\n| 2000 | 142,648,000 | 4,242,689 | 2.97%\n |\n| 2005 | 157,935,000 | 3,254,112 | 2.06%\n |\n\n | ![](image) |\n| Source:[50] | Mostly those born before 1947\n |\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Pakistan\n\nLanguages of Pakistan (2017)[51]\n\n\n\nPunjabi (38.78%)\nPashto (18.24%)\nSindhi (14.57%)\nSaraiki (12.19%)\nUrdu (7.08%)\nBalochi (3.02%)\nHindko (2.24%)\nBrahui (1.24%)\nKashmiri (0.17%)\nOthers (2.47%)\n\n\n\n**Census history of major languages**\n  \n\n| Rank\n | Language\n | 2017 census\n | 1998 census\n | 1981 census\n | 1961 census\n | 1951 census\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Punjabi\\*\n | 38.78%\n | 44.15%\n | 48.17%\n | 56.39%\n | 57.08%\n |\n| 2\n | Pashto | 18.24%\n | 14.42%\n | 13.35%\n | 8.47%\n | 8.16%\n |\n| 3\n | Sindhi | 14.57%\n | 14.1%\n | 12.7%\n | 12.59%\n | 12.85%\n |\n| 4\n | Saraiki\\*\n | 12.19%\n | 10.53%\n | 9.54%\n |  |  |\n| 5\n | Urdu | 7.08%\n | 7.57%\n | 7.60%\n | 7.57%\n | 7.05%\n |\n| 6\n | Balochi | 3.02%\n | 3.57%\n | 3.02%\n | 2.49%\n | 3.04%\n |\n| 7\n | Others\n | 6.12%\n | 4.66%\n | 5.62%\n | 12.49%\n | 11.82%\n |\n\n\n* Saraiki and Hindko was included with Punjabi in the 1951 and 1961 censuses.\n\n\nPakistan is a multilingual country with dozens of languages spoken as first languages.[52][53] The majority Pakistan's languages belong to the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European language family.[54][55]\n\n\nUrdu is the national language and the lingua franca of Pakistan, and while sharing official status with English, it is the preferred and dominant language used for inter-communication between different ethnic groups.[52][53] Numerous regional languages are spoken as first languages by Pakistan's various ethnolinguistic groups. Languages with more than a million speakers each include Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki, Urdu, Balochi, Hindko, Pahari-Pothwari[b] and Brahui.[9]\n\n\nEthnologue lists 74 languages in Pakistan. Of these, 66 are indigenous and 8 are non-indigenous. In terms of their vitality, 7 are classified as 'institutional', 17 are 'developing', 37 are 'vigorous', 10 are 'in trouble', and 3 are 'dying'.[56]\n\n\n\n### Urdu (national language)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Urdu as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\n Urdu (\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648) is the national language (\u0642\u0648\u0645\u06cc \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646) and *lingua franca* of Pakistan.[57] Although only about 7% of Pakistanis speak it as their first language, it is widely spoken and understood as a second language by the vast majority of Pakistanis.[58][59]\n\n\nNo region in Pakistan uses Urdu as its mother tongue, though it is spoken as the first language of Muslim migrants (known as Muhajirs) in Pakistan who left India after independence in 1947.[60] Urdu was chosen as a symbol of unity for the new state of Pakistan in 1947, because it had already served as a *lingua franca* among Muslims in north and northwest British India.[61] It is written, spoken and used in all provinces/territories of Pakistan, and together with English as the main languages of instruction,[62] although the people from differing provinces may have different native languages.[63]\n\n\nUrdu is taught as a compulsory subject up to higher secondary school in both English and Urdu medium school systems, which has produced millions of second-language Urdu speakers among people whose native language is one of the other languages of Pakistan \u2013 which in turn has led to the absorption of vocabulary from various regional Pakistani languages,[64] while some Urdu vocabularies has also been assimilated by Pakistan's regional languages.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### Punjabi[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Punjabi as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nPunjabi (\u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0628\u06cc) is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan. It is spoken as a first language by almost 39% of Pakistanis.[67] It is the 11th most widely spoken language in India, and the third most-spoken native language in the Indian Subcontinent. The language is spoken among a significant overseas diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Punjabi is unusual among the Indo-Aryan languages and the broader Indo-European language family in its usage of lexical tone.[68]\n\n\n\n### Pashto[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Pashto as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nPashto (\u067e\u069a\u062a\u0648) is an Iranian language spoken as a first language by more than 18% of Pakistanis, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in northern Balochistan as well as in ethnic Pashtun communities in the cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, and most notably Karachi,[69][70][71][72] which may have the largest Pashtun population of any city in the world.[73]\n\n\nThere are three major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern (Peshawar) variety, and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas such as in Quetta.\n\n\n\n### Sindhi[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Sindhi as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nSindhi (\u0633\u0646\u068c\u064a) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken as a first language by almost 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The name \"Sindhi\" is derived from *Sindhu*, the original name of the Indus River.[74]\n\n\nLike other languages of this family, Sindhi has passed through Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) and Middle Indo-Aryan (Pali, secondary Prakrits, and Apabhramsha) stages of growth. 20th century Western scholars such as George Abraham Grierson believed that Sindhi descended specifically from the Vr\u0101ca\u1e0da dialect of Apabhramsha (described by Markandeya as being spoken in *Sindhu-de\u015ba*) but later work has shown this to be unlikely.[75] It entered the New Indo-Aryan stage around the 10th century CE.[76][77]\n\n\n\n### Saraiki[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Saraiki as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nSaraiki (\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc) is an Indo-Aryan language of the Lahnda group, spoken in central and southeastern Pakistan, primarily in the southern part of the province of Punjab. Saraiki is to a high degree mutually intelligible with Standard Punjabi[78][79] and shares with it a large portion of its vocabulary and morphology. At the same time in its phonology it is radically different[80] (particularly in the lack of tones, the preservation of the voiced aspirates and the development of implosive consonants), and has important grammatical features in common with the Sindhi language spoken to the south.[78]\n\n\nSaraiki is the language of about 26 million people in Pakistan, ranging across southern Punjab, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and border regions of northern Sindh and eastern Balochistan.[81]\n\n\n\n### Balochi[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Balochi as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nBalochi (\u0628\u0644\u0648\u0686\u06cc) is an Iranian language spoken as a first language by about 3% of Pakistanis, mostly in the Balochistan province. Rakshani is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. Sarhaddi is a sub-dialect of Rakshani. Other sub-dialects are Kalati (Qalati), Chagai-Kharani and Panjguri. Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi is very different from the rest.\n\n\n\n### Hindko[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Hindko as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nHindko (\u06c1\u0646\u062f\u06a9\u0648) is a cover term for a diverse group of Lahnda dialects spoken in several discontinuous areas in northwestern Pakistan, primarily in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.\nHindko is mutually intelligible with Punjabi and Saraiki,[82] and has more affinities with the latter than with the former.[83] Differences with other Punjabi varieties are more pronounced in the morphology and phonology than in the syntax.[84]\nThe word *Hindko*, commonly used to refer to a number of Indo-Aryan dialects spoken in the neighbourhood of Pashto, likely originally meant \"the Indian language\" (in contrast to Pashto).[85] An alternative local name for this language group is *Hindki*.[86][d]\n\n\n\n### Brahui[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The proportion of people with Brahui as their mother tongue in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n\nBrahui (\u0628\u0631\u0627\u06be\u0648\u06cc) is a Dravidian language which is spoken in the central part of Balochistan province. Brahui is spoken in the central part of Pakistani Balochistan, mainly in Kalat, Khuzdar and Mastung districts, but also in smaller numbers in neighbouring districts, as well as in Afghanistan which borders Pakistani Balochistan; however, many members of the ethnic group no longer speak Brahui.[87]\n\n\n\n### Minor languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map showing some of the minor languages in Pakistan as of 1998.\nOther languages spoken by linguistic minorities include the languages listed below, with speakers ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands. A few are highly endangered languages that may soon have no speakers at all.[88] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization defines five levels of language endangerment between \"safe\" (not endangered) and \"extinct\":[89]\n\n\n\n* Vulnerable - \"most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)\"\n* Definitely endangered \u2013 \"children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home\"\n* Severely endangered \u2013 \"language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves\"\n* Critically endangered \u2013 \"the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently\"\n* Extinct \u2013 \"there are no speakers left; included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s\"\n\n\nThe list below includes the findings from the third edition of *Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger* (2010; formerly the *Red Book of Endangered Languages*), as well as the online edition of the aforementioned publication, both published by UNESCO.[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Language\n | Status\n | Comments\n | ISO 639\u20133\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Balti language | Vulnerable[89] | Also spoken in: India\n | bft\n |\n| Bashkarik language | Definitely endangered[89] |  | gwc, xka\n |\n| Badeshi language | Critically endangered[89] |  | bdz\n |\n| Bateri language | Definitely endangered[89] |  | btv\n |\n| Bhadravahi language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: India\n | bhd\n |\n| Brahui language | Vulnerable[89] | Also spoken in: Afghanistan\n | brh\n |\n| Burushaski language | Vulnerable[89] |  | bsk\n |\n| Chilisso language | Severely endangered[89] |  | clh\n |\n| Dameli language | Severely endangered[89] |  | dml\n |\n| Domaaki language | Severely endangered[89] |  | dmk\n |\n| Gawar-Bati language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: Afghanistan\n | gwt\n |\n| Gowro language | Severely endangered[89] |  | gwf\n |\n| Jad language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: India\n | jda\n |\n| Kalasha language | Severely endangered[89] | \u00a0Not to be confused with Kalasha-ala language | kls\n |\n| Kalkoti language | Severely endangered[89] |  |  |\n| Kamkata-vari language, Kata-vari dialect, Kamviri dialect | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: Afghanistan\n | bsh, xvi\n |\n| Khowar language | Vulnerable[89] |  | khw\n |\n| Kundal Shahi language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: India\n |  |\n| Maiya language | Vulnerable[89] |  | mvy\n |\n| Ormuri language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: Afghanistan\n | oru\n |\n| Phalura language | Definitely endangered[89] |  | phl\n |\n| Purik language | Vulnerable[89] | Also spoken in: India\n | prx\n |\n| Savi language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: Afghanistan\n | sdg\n |\n| Spiti language | Vulnerable[89] | Also spoken in: India\n | spt\n |\n| Torwali language | Definitely endangered[89] |  | trw\n |\n| Ushojo language | Definitely endangered[89] |  | ush\n |\n| Wakhi language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: China, Tajikistan, Afghanistan\n | wbl\n |\n| Yidgha language | Definitely endangered[89] |  | ydg\n |\n| Zangskari language | Definitely endangered[89] | Also spoken in: India\n | zau\n |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Pakistan\n\nReligion in Pakistan (2017)[91][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n\nSunni Islam (80%)\nShia Islam (20%)\nHinduism (2.1%)\nChristianity (1.3%)\nOther religions (0.6%)\n\nAccording to the World Factbook, Library of Congress, Oxford University, over 96% of the population of Pakistan is Muslim and the remaining 4% is Hindu, Christian, and others.[92][93][94] Majority of the Muslims practice Sunni with a significant minority of Shi'as.\n\n\nNearly all Pakistani Sunni Muslims belong to the Hanafi school, although there are some Hanbalis and Ahl-e-Hadees. The majority of Shia Muslims belong to the Ithn\u0101'Ashariyyah branch,[92] while a smaller number practice Ismailism. There are small non-Muslim religious groups, including Christians, Ahmadis, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and Zoroastrians (Parsis),[95]\n\n\nThe religious breakdown of the Pakistani population as of Pakistan Census 2017 is as follows:\n\n\n\n* Muslims: 200,362,718\n* Hindus: 4,444,870\n* Christians: 2,642,048\n* Ahmadiyya: 191,737\n* All Others (including Zoroastrians, Sikhs, and Buddhists): 43,253\n\n\n### Recent changes and detailed demographic data[edit]\n\n\nPakistan Bureau of Statistics released religious data of Pakistan Census 2017 on 19 May 2021.[96] 96.47% are Muslims, followed by 2.14% Hindus, 1.27% Christians, 0.09% Ahmadis and 0.02% others.\n\n\nThe 2017 census showed marginal increase in the share of Hindus.The census also recorded Pakistan's first Hindu-majority district, called Umerkot District.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Christianity in Pakistan, while increasing in raw numbers, has fallen significantly in percentage terms since the last census. Christians are concentrated in the most developed parts of Pakistan, Lahore District (over 5% Christian), Islamabad Capital Territory (over 4% Christian), and Northern Punjab.\n\n\nThe Ahmadiyya movement shrunk in size (both raw numbers and percentage) between 1998 and 2017, while remaining concentrated in Lalian Tehsil, Chiniot District, where approximately 13% of the population is Ahmadiyya.\n\n\n\nHere are some maps of Pakistan's religious minority groups as of the 2017 census by district:\n![](image)\nHindu Proportion of each Pakistani District of each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n![](image)\nAhmadiyya Proportion of each Pakistani District of each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\n![](image)\nChristian Proportion of each Pakistani District of each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census\nVirtually all people not belonging to one of these minority groups were Sunni or Shia Muslim, with the most religiously homogeneous areas found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n## Pakistanis around the world[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Overseas Pakistanis\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | 4,000,000 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates | 1,600,000  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 1,200,000 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United States | 600,410[97] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 215,000[98] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Kuwait | 190,000 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Africa | 180,000[99] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Oman | 385,000 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 61,913[100] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 179,668 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Qatar | 52,500 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | 50,000 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Norway | 39,257[101] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 21,000 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand | 10,000 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ireland | 9,501 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 22,118[102] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Overseas Pakistani\n* Minorities in Pakistan\n* Ethnic groups of Pakistan\n* Languages of Pakistan\n* Indo-Iranians\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Major ethnolonguistic group in Azad Kashmir.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lack of exact numbers of speakers of the language due to the language not being represented in the previous censuses.

Lothers & Lothers (2010, p.\u00a09) estimate the Pakistani population at well over 2.5\u00a0million and the UK diaspora at over 0.5\u00a0million.

          "content": "<document>\n<title>List of cities in China by population</title>\n<content>\nThe five largest cities in China by population are Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chengdu.[1]\n\n\nAs of 2017, there were 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in urban areas.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Definition and classification[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the administrative divisions of China, there are three levels of cities, namely direct-administered municipalities (\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02), prefecture-level cities (\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02), and county-level cities (\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e02). The special administrative regions (\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a) of Hong Kong and Macau are not included in this administrative classification.\n\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a 'city' in the strictest sense of the term, but are, instead, an administrative unit comprising, typically, both the urban core (*a city in the strict sense*) and surrounding rural or less-urbanized areas.[3]\n\n\nPrefecture-level cities nearly always contain multiple counties (\u53bf), county-level cities, and other such sub-divisions. To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (*city in the strict sense*), the term \"\u5e02\u533a\" (*sh\u00ec q\u016b*; \"urban area\") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than 3,000 square kilometres (1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), sometimes only the urban core, whereas the agglomeration overtakes the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ec q\u016b\", or \"urban area\", would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.\n\n\nWhile in 2013 Chongqing had the largest population total of any special municipality, 28 million, only 4.5 million of the people were in the actual Chongqing urban area, with the remainder of the population in suburban and rural areas.[4]\n\n\n\n## List of major cities by population[edit]\n\n\nThe list contains all the cities with the administrative designation of \"national central city\" (\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57ce\u5e02) and \"sub-provincial city\" (\u526f\u7701\u7ea7\u57ce\u5e02) \u2013 including five \"cities with independent planning status\" (\u8ba1\u5212\u5355\u5217\u5e02) and ten large \"provincial capital cities\" (\u7701\u4f1a\u57ce\u5e02), as well as some large \"special economic zones\" (\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u533a\u57ce\u5e02), \"open coastal cities\" (\u6cbf\u6d77\u5f00\u653e\u57ce\u5e02), and \"prefecture-level cities\" (\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02).[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Legend:\n\u235f National Capital City\n# National Central City\n\\* Provincial Capital City\n~ Open Coastal

As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\n\n\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. urban areas or metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\n\n## 50 states and Washington, D.C.[edit]\n\n\n\nThis table lists the 333 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S. territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000. They are: Delaware, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n\nThe table displays:\n\n\n\n1. The city rank by population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n2. The city name[1]\n3. The name of the state in which the city lies[1]\n4.

It excludes urban-characterized settlements such as regency seats, which does not have city status. Indonesia has 93 cities classified as *kota* (city) and one provincial-level capital city. Population figures are taken from the 2020 census by Statistics Indonesia (BPS).[1]\n\n\nJakarta is the largest city and the only megacity in Indonesia, with a population of 10.70 million. As a primate city, Jakarta is nearly four times larger than the second largest city Surabaya. Jakarta's status is unique compared to other cities in Indonesia, since it is technically a province with a city management. It is subdividied into five administrative cities and an administrative regency, which are not self-governed (without municipal council nor government budget). All five of Jakarta's satellite cities also have passed one million mark in population, with the largest one being Bekasi.\n\n\nThe other largest cities by region include Medan (Sumatra, also the largest outside of Java), Samarinda (Kalimantan), Denpasar (Lesser Sunda Islands), Makassar (Sulawesi), Ambon (Maluku Islands), and Jayapura (Western New Guinea). Jayapura is also the fastest-growing city Indonesia, at 70% in a decade.\n\n\nMost of the provinces' largest cities in Indonesia are also their capital cities. The exceptions are Bekasi (West Java), Tangerang (Banten), Batam (Riau Islands), Banjarmasin (South Kalimantan), Tarakan (North Kalimantan), and Ternate (North Maluku).\n\n\n\n\n## Cities by

City populations found in this list only refer to the population found within the city's defined limits and any adjacent cantonment, if exists (except for Gujranwala and Okara). The census totals below come from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics[1] for the four provinces of Pakistan and the Islamabad Capital Territory, and from the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Planning & Development Department (PND AJK) for cities inside Azad Kashmir.[2]\n\n\nAs of the 2017 Census, there are two megacities, ten million-plus cities, and 100 cities having a population of 100,000 or more. Of these 100 cities, 58 are located in the country's most populous province, Punjab, 22 in Sindh, 11 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six in Balochistan, two in Azad Kashmir, and one in Islamabad Capital Territory. It is unknown whether Gilgit-Baltistan has any city with over 100,000 people or not, as Gilgit-Baltistan has not yet publicly released any 2017 census results. As in the previous census in 1998, the largest city of Gilgit-Baltistan was Gilgit, with 56,701 inhabitants.\n\n\n\n##
