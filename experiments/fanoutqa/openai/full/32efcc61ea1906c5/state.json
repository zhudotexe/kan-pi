W. Post, owns a large portfolio of cereal brands that include Bran Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Golden Crisp, Grape-Nuts, Honeycomb, Oreo O's, Pebbles, and Waffle Crisp, among others. The company also produces several pet food brands, including Rachael Ray Nutrish, Kibbles 'n Bits, and 9Lives, and markets Peter Pan Peanut Butter.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)C.W. Post, founder\nC. W. Post established his company in Battle Creek, Michigan, having lived there since 1891, when he was a patient at a holistic sanitarium operated by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.[1][2] Dr. Kellogg, with his brother W. K. Kellogg, had developed a dry corn flake cereal that was part of their patients\u2019 diet. Post's first product, introduced in 1895, was not a cereal, however, but a roasted, cereal-based beverage, Postum. Having developed an aversion to coffee during his time in the sanitarium, Post positioned Postum as a healthy alternative. Its advertising slogan, which he coined himself, was, \"There's a Reason.\" Postum's main ingredients were naturally caffeine-free wheat grain, bran, and molasses. Initially, Postum had to be brewed like coffee, but in 1911, Post introduced a powdered, instant formulation. This version of the product was manufactured in Battle Creek until it was discontinued in 2007. As of January 2013, Eliza's Quest Food had succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.\n\n\nIn 1897, Post introduced his first dry cereal, a crunchy blend of wheat and barley, which he called Grape Nuts. His first corn-flake product was introduced as \"Elijah's Manna\" in 1904. Owing to consumer resistance to the (inaccurate) biblical reference[3] that was so great that even Great Britain flatly refused to register the name as a trademark, it was renamed Post Toasties in 1907.[4]\n\n\nC. W. Post was an astute businessman who believed that advertising and aggressive marketing were the keys to a successful enterprise. Within 10 years of its incorporation, his Postum Cereal Company had more than $10 million in capital and was spending $400,000 a year on advertising, sums which were remarkable for the period.[5] Although he vigorously opposed labor unions, his employees were the highest-paid in his industry and working conditions at the Post factory were exemplary. He even developed a factory town in which he sold homes to his workers at favorable rates.\n\n\nPostum Cereal Company lost its founder in 1914. C.W. Post underwent an apparently successful appendectomy at the Mayo Clinic, but shortly after returning home to recuperate, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Post had for years suffered from bouts of illness and depression. While his death was without warning, his company was not left rudderless. His daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, had been raised in the business and was familiar with virtually every aspect of its operations.[6] She assumed control of the now $20-million Postum Company and managed its affairs for the next eight years. While she did not oversee major product innovations, she did have a good feel for business and for promoting talented managers. In addition, her second marriage, in 1920, was to Edward F. Hutton, the founder of a brokerage firm on Wall Street.\n\n\nGross revenues in 1921 were $17.75 million.[7] In 1922, Hutton took the newly incorporated Postum Cereal Company public by issuing 200,000 common shares. The 1920s was a period in which common stock was still considered highly speculative, and consequently the newly issued shares carried a dividend at the rate of $5.00 per year.\n\n\nRevenues in 1922 were essentially the same as in 1921, but in 1923, they were $22.25 million and a stock split, in the form of a 100% stock dividend, increased the authorized shares to 400,000. These shares also earned a $3.00 annual cash dividend, representing a 20% increase over the presplit rate. In 1925, with revenues now at $27.4 million, the stock was split once again and the dividend was increased to $4.00 per new share.\n\n\n\n### Major acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative placque at the Postum Cereal Company Factory, September 2014\nStarting in 1925, under the leadership of financier (and at one point, son in-law to the founder), E. F. Hutton as chairman and Colby M. Chester as president, Postum Cereal made the first of a series of corporate acquisitions which would within a few years transform it into the dominant U.S. packaged grocery products manufacturer.\n\n\nIt began late that year with the purchase of the Jell-O Company. Jell-O had been first produced in 1897 by Pearle Bixby Wait, a carpenter from the town of LeRoy in northern New York state. Mr. Wait's product was based upon a patent that had been issued to inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper in 1845, but which Cooper had never developed commercially. However, Wait was unsuccessful in marketing Jell-O, and in 1899, he sold the rights to it for $450 to a neighbor, Orator Francis Woodward, who had founded the Genesee Pure Food Company in 1897. Genesee became the Jell-O Company in 1923, the same year it began marketing D-Zerta, a sugar-free gelatin, and a powdered mixture for making ice cream in the kitchen.\n\n\nIn 1926, Postum Cereal acquired Igleheart Brothers, Inc (established in 1856), the makers of Swans Down cake flour, and followed this with the purchase of the Minute Tapioca Company. \"Tapioca Superlative\" had been invented in 1894 by a Boston woman, Susan Stavers, who made it from tapioca flakes that she ran through her coffee grinder. Later that year, she sold the rights to John Whitman, of Orange, Massachusetts, who changed its name to \"Minute Tapioca\". In 1908, he changed the name of his company to that of his product. The \"Minute\" brand would later become better known for a General Foods innovation introduced in 1949 known as Minute Rice, a brand of parboiled rice.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the Jell-O and Minute Tapioca acquisitions, Postum Cereal's revenues in 1926 jumped to $46.9 million. The number of shares stood at 1.375 million, including shares issued to acquire Jell-O and Minute Tapioca. The dividend was increased to $4.70 a year.\n\n\nThe acquisition spree continued in 1927 with the purchase of two similarly named confectionery companies, chocolate-maker Walter Baker (founded in 1765, making it the oldest component of the Postum constituent companies), and coconut-processor Franklin Baker, which had begun early in the 19th century as a flour broker, but whose confectionery products dated from 1895. This was followed by the purchase of Log Cabin Products, the maker of Log Cabin Syrup (first produced in 1887), and of Richard Hellmann, Inc (established in 1913), the producer of Blue Ribbon mayonnaise. And late in the year, Postum Cereal began selling its first coffee product, \"Sanka\", by obtaining US marketing rights from Dr Ludwig Roselius of Bremen, Germany. Roselius had developed the decaffeinated coffee in 1906 and began selling it in the US in 1923.[8]\n\n\nThree more acquisitions followed in 1928. The most important was that of the Cheek-Neel Coffee Company. Its product, Maxwell House, dating from 1892, was a well-known brand in what was still a fragmented US coffee market. Within a few years, however, it was to become the number one brand in America and would retain that position well into the 1980s. Also acquired during 1928 was the La France Manufacturing Company, a maker of starch and other laundry products (this being Postum's first venture into nonedibles), and the Calumet Baking Powder Company, the leading maker of this kitchen essential.\n\n\nFinancially, the year culminated on October 1 with the inclusion of Postum, Inc in the newly reformulated Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 common stocks.[9] By year-end, revenues stood at $101 million and the dividend on the five million authorized shares was $5.00 per year, a 25-fold increase since 1922.\n\n\n\n### Purchase of General Foods and renaming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Foods 1937 Specimen Stock Certificate\nBy far the most important acquisition of 1929 was of the frozen-food company owned by Clarence Birdseye,[10] called \"General Foods Company\". Birdseye (December 9, 1886 - October 7, 1956) was one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of the food industry. Born in New York City, he became interested in the frozen preservation of food during the course of working as a fur trader in Labrador between 1912 and 1916. By 1923, he had developed a commercially viable process for quick-freezing foods using a belt mechanism, which he patented. In 1924, with backing from three investors, he formed the General Seafoods Company, in Gloucester, Massachusetts, to produce frozen haddock fillets packed in plain cardboard boxes.\n\n\nThe founder's daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, was first to become excited about the prospects for the frozen foods business. In 1926, she had put into port at Gloucester on her yacht, *Hussar (IV)*, and was served a luncheon meal which, she learned to her amazement, had been frozen six months before. Despite her enthusiasm, it took Post three years to convince Postum's management to acquire the company. Postum paid $10.75 million for a 51% interest and its partner, Goldman Sachs, paid $12.5 million for the other 49%.[11] Following this acquisition, Postum, Inc changed its name to General Foods Corporation. Goldman sold its share back to General Foods in 1932, apparently at a slight loss.\n\n\nShortly after the acquisition, General Foods began test-marketing an expanded line of frozen foods, but the company quickly realized that a packaging process alone would not be sufficient to market frozen products in stores. To be sold, the packages had to be kept frozen while on display, so Birdseye engineers began development of a freezer cabinet designed specifically to hold frozen foods. The cabinet, which first appeared in 1934, required a great deal of space and electricity, which were not readily available in most grocery stores of the period. For those stores which could accommodate them, the payback was immediate. Housewives quickly realized that keeping packages of frozen food in the icebox could mean fresher meals and fewer trips to the market.[12]\n\n\nThe company published a cook book in 1932, the *General Foods Cook Book*, dedicated \"To the American homemaker\". Five editions were published between 1932 and 1937. The book includes photographs (among which is \"General Foods offers over twenty famous products for your well-stocked pantry shelf\") and a subject index.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## After General Foods[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Ralcorp announced plans to spin off Post Foods into a separate company. About a quarter of Ralcorp's sales in 2010 were generated by its Post Foods unit.[14] The spinoff was completed with an IPO for Post Holdings, Inc. on February 7, 2012.[15]\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired Michael Foods.[16] The following year, Post Foods purchased MOM Brands (formerly Malt-O-Meal Co.) creating the third largest breakfast cereal company in the US. At this point, Post Foods rebranded as Post Consumer Brands, and is headquartered in Lakeville, Minnesota.\n\n\nIn July 2017, Post Holdings bought Weetabix Limited for \u00a31.4\u00a0billion.[17] In 2019, the company began combining some of its MOM Brands and Weetabix cereal brands under the Three Sisters Cereal name.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Post Holdings announced that it was acquiring the Peter Pan peanut butter brand from Conagra Brands.[18] The transaction was completed on January 25, 2021.[19] With the acquisition of Peter Pan peanut butter on January 25, 2021, Post created a new group called Animated Brands,[20] with the Peter Pan brand being the founding member. Animated Brands is managed under Post Consumer Brands.\n\n\nOn June 1, 2021, Post announced it acquired the ready-to-eat (\"RTE\") cereal business of TreeHouse Foods.[21] The TreeHouse Foods RTE cereal business was added to Post Consumer Brands' broad portfolio of private label cereal products.\n\n\nIn February 2023, Post Holdings announced its acquisition of pet food brands like 9Lives, Kibbles \u2018n Bits and Gravy Train. Such acquisition would enable Post's entry to the 'pet food category'. After the completion of this acquisition, Post intends to develop a new pet food category within Post Consumer Brands. [22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### Postum advertisements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Postum\n\nPostum, a coffee substitute made out of roasted grain, was created in 1895. It was popular through the early 20th century, particularly during World War II when coffee was rationed.\n\n\n\nDue to its decline in popularity, Post announced its discontinuation in 2007.[25][26][27] It was later revived by Eliza's Quest Food in 2013.[28]\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## Post Consumer Brands brands \u2013 present cereals and products[edit]\n\n\n* 100% Bran \u2013 currently only available in Canada\n* Airly Foods - Butter\n* Airly Foods - Cheddar\n* Airly Foods - Chocolate\n* Airly Foods - Cinnamon\n* Airly Foods - Salted Caramel\n* Airly Foods - Sea Salt\n* Bran Flakes\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Maple & Brown Sugar[29]\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Cinnamon Roll\n* Better Oats - Classic Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Classic Strawberries & Cream\n* Better Oats - Organic Maple and Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Organic Bare\n* Better Oats - Organic Old Fashioned Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Steel Cut Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Quick Oats\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar with Protein\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Original\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Blueberry Muffin\n* Chips Ahoy!\n* CoCo Wheats\n* Farina (food) Mills hot wheat cereal\n* Cocoa Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles\n* Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles Treats\n* Fruity Pebbles Crisps[30]\n* Cocoa Pebbles Crisps\n* Golden Crisp\n* Grape-Nuts\n* Grape-Nuts Flakes\n* Great Grains Banana Nut Crunch\n* Great Grains Blueberry Morning\n* Great Grains Cranberry Almond Crunch\n* Great Grains Crunchy Pecans\n* Great Grains Raisins, Dates & Pecans\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 with Almonds\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 with Real Strawberries\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Pecan & Maple Brown Sugar\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Frosted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Whole Grain Honey Crunch\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Granola \u2013 Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Granola \u2013 French Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Granola \u2013 Maple Pecan\n* Honey Maid S'mores\n* Honeycomb\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Original[31]\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Chocolate\n* Oh's\n* Oreo O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Maple & Brown Sugar Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Original Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Apple Zings\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolately Chip Cookie Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Churr-O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cinnamon Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Coco Roos\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cookies & Cream\n* Malt-O-Meal - Crispy Rice\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Flakes\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Blasts\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Honey O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Puffs\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Buzzers\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Graham Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Nut Scooters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Almonds\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Honey\n* Malt-O-Meal - Peanut Butter Cups\n* Malt-O-Meal - Raisin Bran\n* Malt-O-Meal - S'mores\n* Malt-O-Meal - Strawberry Cream Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities with Marshmallows\n* Post Dunkin' cereal - Caramel Macchiato\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Chocolate Almond\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Mixed Berry Almond\n* Raisin Bran\n* Shredded Wheat (made by Nestl\u00e9 and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Original Spoon Size\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Original Big Biscuit\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Wheat'N Bran Spoon Size\n* Shreddies \u2013 currently only available in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany (made by Nestl\u00e9 and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Waffle Crisp\n\n## Post Consumer Brands discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\n* 40% Bran Flakes\n* Alpha-Bits\n* Beep Beep (with the Wile E.

Post, who took the cereal business seriously, was equipped to market and advertise his products nationwide; so successfully, in fact, that W.K. Kellogg broke away from his brother and in 1907 founded his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company (renamed the Kellogg Company in 1922). Kellogg's Corn Flakes eventually overtook Post Toasties in popularity and the latter brand is today only a minor player in the dry-cereal market.\n5. **^** See *International Directory of Company Histories*, Volume 2, pp 530-32, published by St. James Press, 1990, for details relating to the company during this period.\n6. **^** Biographical details of Post's life may be found in *American National Biography*, Volume 7, p. 732.\n7. **^** Financial details for the company during this period may be found in the annual issues of \u2019\u2019Moody\u2019s Manual of Investments American and Foreign Industrial Securities\u2019\u2019, published by Moody\u2019s Investor Services.\n8. **^** \"Sanka\" is a contraction of the French words, *sans caf\u00e9ine*. Roselius for many years had had little success in finding a viable decaffeination process. Legend has it that when a shipment of green coffee sank in Bremen harbor, the beans came out caffeine free. Ultimately, Roselius settled on a washing process under more sanitary conditions. General Foods purchased Roselius's American company outright in 1932 and the original German company, Sanka HAG, AG, in 1979.\n9. **^** \"djindexes.com\" (PDF).

It is not immediately clear how General Foods came to acquire the product name, but Birds Eye frozen vegetables were a major component of its business until the division was sold to Dean Foods in 1993.\n12. **^** The space and power requirements for the burgeoning frozen-food section was one factor which led to the rapid development of larger self-service supermarkets beginning in the late 1930s.\n13. **^** General Foods Consumer Service Department *General Foods Cook Book*.

Kellogg's produces cereal (outside North America) and convenience foods, including crackers and toaster pastries, and markets their products by several well-known brands including the Kellogg's brand itself, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, Eggo, and Cheez-It, along with cereal internationally such as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Coco Pops.\n\n\nKellogg's products are manufactured and marketed in over 180 countries.[3] Kellogg's largest factory is at Trafford Park in Trafford, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, which is also the location of its UK headquarters.[4] Other corporate office locations outside of Battle Creek include Chicago, Dublin (European Headquarters), Shanghai, and Quer\u00e9taro City.[5] Kellogg's held a Royal Warrant from Queen Elizabeth II until her death in 2022.[6]\n\n\nKellogg's was split into two companies on October 2, 2023, with WK Kellogg Co owning the North American cereal division, and the existing company being rebranded to **Kellanova**, owning brands such as Pop-Tarts and Pringles alongside the international cereal division. Kellogg's itself would become a brand name of both companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Will Keith Kellogg\n\n![](image)First Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Co. corn flakes package (1906), later to become the Kellogg Food Company in 1908\nIn 1876, John Harvey Kellogg became the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium (originally the Western Health Reform Institute founded by Ellen White) and his brother, W. K. Kellogg, worked as the bookkeeper. This is where corn flakes were created and led to the eventual formation of the Kellogg Company.\n\n\nFor years, W. K. Kellogg assisted his brother in research to improve the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played.[7] It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the following day, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked.[7]\n\n\nW. K. Kellogg persuaded his brother to serve the food in a flake form. Soon the flaked wheat was being packaged to meet hundreds of guest mail-order requests after they left the Sanitarium. However, Dr. John Harvey forbade his brother Will from distributing cereal beyond his consumers. As a result, the brothers fell out, and W. K. launched the **Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company** on February 19, 1906.[8][9] On July 4, 1907, a fire destroyed the main factory building. W.K. Kellogg had the new plant in full operation six months after the fire.[10]\n\n\nConvincing his brother to relinquish rights to the product, Will's company produced and marketed the hugely successful Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes and was renamed the **Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company** in 1909, taking on the current name of the **Kellogg Company** in 1922.[8]\n\n\nBy 1909, Will's company produced 120,000 cases of Corn Flakes daily. John, who resented his brother's success, filed suit against Will's company in 1906 for the right to use the family name. The resulting legal battle, which included a trial that lasted an entire month, ended in December 1920 when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in Will's favor.[11]\n\n\nIn 1931, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks from the usual 40. W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed to support people through the depression era. This practice remained until World War II and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980.[12]\n\n\nIn 1964, Kellogg's introduced its first non-cereal product. A pastry which can be heated in a toaster called Pop-Tarts.[13]\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970, the slogan \u201cKellogg's puts more into your day\u201d was used on Sunday morning TV shows. From 1969 to 1977, Kellogg's acquired various small businesses, including Salada Tea, Fearn International, Mrs. Smith's Pies, Eggo, and Pure Packed Foods;[14] however, it was later criticized for not diversifying further like General Mills and Quaker Oats were. After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's US market share hit a low of 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \"a fine company that's past its prime\" and the cereal market was being regarded as \"mature\". Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers aged 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior. The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, worth $3.7 billion at retail in 1983, totaled $5.4 billion by 1988 and had expanded three times as fast as the average grocery category. Kellogg's also introduced new products, including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits, and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post, which had difficulty in the adult cereal market.[15]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion.[16] Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.[17]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kellogg's became the world's second-largest snack food company (after PepsiCo) by acquiring the potato crisps brand Pringles from Procter & Gamble for $2.7 billion in a cash deal.[18]\n\n\nIn 2017, Kellogg's acquired Chicago-based food company Rxbar for $654 million.[19] Earlier that year, Kellogg's also opened new corporate office space in Chicago's Merchandise Mart for its global growth and IT departments.[20] In the UK, Kellogg's also released the W. K. Kellogg brand of organic, vegan and plant-based cereals (such as granolas, organic wholegrain wheat, and \"super grains\") with no added sugars.[21]\n\n\nIn 2018, Kellogg's decided to cease their operations in Venezuela due to the economic crisis the country is facing.[22] Their factories were taken by the Venezuelan state under the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro administration. In mid-2019, Venezuelan Kellogg's cereal boxes began portraying the Venezuelan flag and a motto from Maduro: \"Together, everything is possible\" (Spanish: *Juntos todo es posible*) alongside Kellogg's logo and mascots were sold all over the country. Kellogg's considers it as an illicit use, and the company stated they would take legal action.[23]\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, it was announced that Kellogg's was selling Famous Amos, Murray's, Keebler, Mother's, and Little Brownie Bakers (one of the producers of the cookies for the Girl Scouts of the USA) to Ferrero SpA for $1.4 billion.[24][25][26] On July 29, 2019, that sale was completed.[27] Kellogg's kept the Keebler cracker line and replaced the Keebler name on their crackers with the Kellogg's name.\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kellogg's announced their next-generation *Kellogg's\u00ae Better Days* global commitment, focusing on hunger, children, and farmers, with specific targets to reach by 2030.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Kellogg's partnered with GLAAD by \"launching a new limited edition \"All Together Cereal\" and donating $50,000 to support GLAAD's anti-bullying and LGBTQ advocacy efforts\". The All Together cereal combined six mini cereal boxes into one package to bring attention to anti-bullying.[29]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Kellogg's decided to work with suppliers to phase out the use of glyphosate by 2025, which some farmers have used as a drying agent for wheat and oats supplied to Kellogg's.[30]\n\n\nIn October 2021, workers at all of Kellogg's cereal-producing plants in the United States went on a strike conducted by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union over disagreements over the terms of a new labor contract.[31] On December 3, 2021, a tentative deal was struck to end the worker strike,[32] but the union members overwhelmingly rejected the tentative agreement[33] and Kellogg's management announced they would seek to replace all 1,400 striking workers.[34] On December 21, 2021, about 1,400 Kellogg workers approved a collective bargaining agreement, ending the strike, which had lasted 77 days.[35][36][37]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2022, Kellogg's announced that the company would spin off three cereal, snacks, and plant-based food divisions.[38][39] The North American cereal and plant-based food spin-off companies will keep Battle Creek as their headquarters and the new snack and international cereal company will be based in Chicago.[40] The successor company, known as Global Snacking Co. temporarily, represents 80 percent or $11.4 billion of Kellogg's sales. 60 percent of Global Snacking's business was snacks, and nearly half of the company's business was in the United States. The cereal business, temporarily called North America Cereal Co., would be the second-largest American cereal company and the largest in Canada and the Caribbean, with 5 of the top 11 brands and $2.4 billion in annual sales. Plant-based foods, representing $340 million in annual sales, would be called \"Plant Co.\" and could even be sold.[41] In January 2023, Kellogg's shelved its plans to spin off its plant food business and would retain it as part of Global Snacking Co.[42] On March 15, 2023, Kellogg's announced that North America Cereal Co. branch will be named WK Kellogg Co and Global Snacking Co. branch will be called Kellanova. The ticker symbol \"K\" will be used by Kellanova on the NYSE.[43] The split was completed on October 2, 2023.[44][45] The WK Kellogg Co has the NYSE stock symbol \"KLG\".[46]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Kellogg's reported earnings of US$1.269 billion, with an annual revenue of US$12.932 billion, a decline of 0.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Kellogg's market capitalization was valued at over US$22.1 billion in November 2018.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein mil. US$\n | Net incomein mil. US$\n | Total Assetsin mil.

Foremost among these is the design of the Kellogg's logo by Ferris Crane under the art direction of famed type guru Y. Ames. Another was the well-remembered jingle \"K E double-L, O double-good, Kellogg's best to you!\".\n\n\nWith the rising popularity of patent medicine in early 20th century advertising, The Kellogg Company of Canada published a book named *A New Way of Living* that showed readers \"how to achieve a new way of living; how to preserve vitality; how to maintain enthusiasm and energy; how to get the most out of life because of a physical ability to enjoy it\". It touted the All-Bran cereal as the secret to leading \"normal\" lives free of constipation.[82]\n\n\nKellogg's was a major sponsor throughout the run of the hit CBS panel show *What's My Line?*[83] It and its associated products Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies were also major sponsors for the PBS Kids children's animated series *Dragon Tales*.[84]\n\n\nKellogg's is a sponsor of USA Gymnastics and produced the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics, a 36-city tour held in 2016 after the Olympic games and featured performances by recent medal-winning gymnasts from the United States.[85]\n\n\nKellogg's is currently the title sponsor of three college football bowl games. First, it was announced in 2019 that Kellogg's would become the new title sponsor of the Sun Bowl game, with the game being branded as the \"Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl\".[86] This was followed in 2020 by the company using its Cheez-It brand to sponsor of the game now known as the Pop-Tarts Bowl.[87] In 2022, Kellogg's added the Citrus Bowl to its bowl sponsorships, with the game branded as the \"Cheez-It Citrus Bowl\".[88]\n\n\n\n### Premiums and prizes[edit]\n\n\nW.K. Kellogg was the first to introduce prizes in boxes of cereal. The marketing strategy that he established has produced thousands of different cereal box prizes that have been distributed by the tens of billions.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Children's premiums[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1909, Kellogg's Corn Flakes had the first cereal premium with *The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book.* The book was originally available as a prize that was given to the customer in the store with the purchase of two packages of the cereal.[90] But in 1909, Kellogg's changed the book giveaway to a premium mail-in offer for the cost of a dime. Over 2.5 million copies of the book were distributed in different editions over a period of 23 years.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Cereal box prizes[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, Kellogg's inserted a prize in the form of pin-back buttons into each box of Pep cereal. Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics and were available through 1947. There were five series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection.[89] Other manufacturers of major brands of cereal, including General Mills, Malt-O-Meal, Nestl\u00e9, Post Foods, and Quaker Oats, followed suit and inserted prizes into boxes of cereal to promote sales and brand loyalty.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nLicensed brands have been omitted since the corresponding mascots would be obvious (for example, Spider-Man is the mascot for Spider-Man Spidey-Berry).\n\n\n\n* Cocoa Hoots cereal: Newton the Owl\n* Cocoa Krispies cereal (Known as Choco Krispis in Latin America, Choco Krispies in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Switzerland, Chocos in India, and Coco Pops in Australia, the UK, and Europe): Jose (monkey), Coco (monkey), Melvin (elephant), Snagglepuss (Hanna-Barbera character), Ogg (caveman), Tusk (elephant), and Snap, Crackle and Pop (who were also, and remain as of February 2014, the Rice Krispies mascots; see below)\n* Corn Flakes cereal: Cornelius (rooster)\n* Frosted Flakes (known as Frosties outside the US/Canada, Zucaritas in Latin America and Sucrilhos in Brazil) cereal: Tony the Tiger\n* Froot Loops cereal: Toucan Sam\n* Honey Smacks (US)/Smacks (other markets) cereal: Dig 'Em Frog\n* Raisin Bran cereal: Sunny the Sun\n* Rice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) cereal: Snap, Crackle and Pop\n* Ricicles (UK Only) cereal: Captain Rik\n* Apple Jacks cereal: CinnaMon and Bad Apple\n* Honey Loops cereal: Loopy (bumblebee), Pops (honey bee)\n* Keebler cookies and crackers: Ernie and the Elves\n\n### Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's made its first foray into auto racing between 1991 and 1992 when the company sponsored the #41 Chevrolets fielded by Larry Hedrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series and driven by Phil Parsons, Dave Marcis, Greg Sacks, Hut Stricklin, and Richard Petty, but they gained greater prominence for their sponsorship of two-time Winston Cup Champion Terry Labonte from 1993 to 2006, the last 12 years of that as the sponsor for Hendrick Motorsports' No.5 car. Kellogg's sponsored the No.5 car for Labonte, Kyle Busch, Casey Mears, and Mark Martin until 2010, and it then served as an associate sponsor for Carl Edwards' #99 car for Roush Fenway Racing.\n\n\nKellogg's placed Dale Earnhardt on Kellogg's Corn Flakes boxes for 1993 six-time Winston Cup champion and 1994 seven-time Winston Cup champion, as well as Jeff Gordon on the Mini Wheats box for the 1993 Rookie of the Year, 1995 Brickyard 400 inaugural race, 1997 Champion, and 1998 three-time champion, and a special three-pack racing box set with Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte, and Dale Jarrett in 1996.\n\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has used some merchandising for their products. Kellogg's once released *Mission Nutrition*, a PC game that came free with special packs of cereal. It played in a similar fashion as *Donkey Kong Country*; users could play as Tony the Tiger, Coco the Monkey, or Snap, Crackle, and Pop. Kellogg's has also released \"Talking\" games. The two current versions are Talking Tony and Talking Sam. In these games, a microphone is used to play games and create voice commands for their computers. In Talking Tony, Tony the Tiger, one of Kellogg's most famous mascots, would be the main and only character in the game. In Talking Sam, Toucan Sam, another famous mascot, would be in the game, instead. Some [toy cars] have the Kellogg's logo on them, and occasionally their mascots.\n\n\nThere was also a Talking Snap Crackle and Pop software.\n\n\n\n### Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's frequently partners with the Olympic Games to feature American athletes from the Olympic Games on the packages of their cereal brands.[92] In 2017, the company announced its marketing campaign for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games featuring American athletes Nathan Chen, Kelly Clark, Meghan Duggan and Mike Schultz.[93]\n\n\n\n## Misleading claims[edit]\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\n> \n> We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims\u2014not once, but twice\u2014that its cereals improve children's health...\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the F.T.C.[94]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Kellogg's was found to be making unsubstantiated and misleading claims in advertising their cereal products by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).[94][95][96]\n\n\nKellogg's responded by stating \"We stand behind the validity of our product claims and research, so we agreed to an order that covers those claims. We believe that the revisions to the existing consent agreement satisfied any remaining concerns.\"[96]\n\n\nThe FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved kids' attentiveness by nearly 20%.[97]\n\n\nThe Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has also suggested that the language on Kellogg Pop-Tarts packages saying the pastries are \"Made with Real Fruit\" should be taken off the products.[98] In July 2012, the UK banned a \"Special K\" advertisement due to its citing caloric values that did not take into account the caloric value of milk consumed with the cereal.[99] In 2016 an ad telling UK consumers that Special K is \u201cfull of goodness\u201d and \u201cnutritious\u201d was banned.[100]\n\n\n\n### Questionable nutritional value[edit]\n\n\nSome of Kellogg's marketing has been questioned in the press, prompted by an increase in consumer awareness of the mismatch between the marketing messages and the products themselves.[101]\n\n\nFood bloggers are also questioning the marketing methods used by cereal manufacturing companies such as Kellogg's, due to their high sugar content and use of ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2021 Pop-Tarts lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA class-action lawsuit was filed against Kellogg's in October 2021 claiming they are not putting enough strawberries in their strawberry flavored Pop-Tarts, and seeking $5 million in damages.[103] In April 2022, the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge.[104]\n\n\nAnother lawsuit was filed against Kellog's in 2021, with the plaintiff claiming that Kellogg's defrauded customers regarding the contents of its Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts. The plaintiff stated she would not have purchased the Pop-Tarts had she known they did not contain milk, milkfat, or butter. In June 2022, a US district judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating that a reasonable consumer would not expect those ingredients.[105]\n\n\n\n## Recalls[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, the company voluntarily began to recall about 28 million boxes of Apple Jacks, Corn Pops, Froot Loops and Honey Smacks because of an unusual smell and flavor from the packages' liners that could make people ill. Kellogg's said about 20 people complained about the cereals, including five who reported nausea and vomiting. Consumers reported the cereal smelled or tasted waxy or like metal or soap. Company spokeswoman J. Adaire Putnam said some described it as tasting stale. However, no serious health problems had been reported.[106]\n\n\nThe suspected chemical that caused the illnesses was 2-methylnaphthalene, used in the cereal packaging process. Little is known about 2-methylnaphthalene's impact on human health as the Food and Drug Administration has no scientific data on its impact on humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also does not have health and safety data. This is despite the EPA having sought information on it from the chemical industry for 16 years. 2-Methylnaphthalene is a component of crude oil and is \"structurally related to naphthalene, an ingredient in mothballs and toilet-deodorant blocks\" that the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen.[107][108]\n\n\n*Kellogg's* offered consumers refunds in the meantime.[109] Only products with the letters \"KN\" following the use-by date were included in the recall.[110] The products were distributed throughout the US and began arriving in stores in late March 2010. Products in Canada were not affected.[111]\n\n\n\n### 2012 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's issued a voluntary recall of some of its \"Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size Original\" and \"Mini-Wheats Unfrosted Bite Size\" products due to the possibility of flexible metal mesh fragments in the food. The affected products varied in size from single-serving bowls to large 70-ounce cartons. Use-by dates printed on the recalled packages ranged from April 1, 2013, to September 21, 2013, and were accompanied by the letters KB, AP or FK.[112]\n\n\n\n## Human rights violations and strikes[edit]\n\n\n### Human right violations of palm oil in 2016[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Amnesty International in 2016, Kellogg's palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14-year-old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from chemicals such as Paraquat.[113][114] Kellogg's alleged not being aware of the child abuses due to traceability; Amnesty's human rights director replied that \"Using mealy-mouthed excuses about 'traceability' is a total cop-out.\"[115]\n\n\n\n### 2021 strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Kellogg's strike\n\nIn October 2021, over a thousand employees at four Kelloggs manufacturing plants in the United States went on strike for better working conditions and higher wages. Two months into the strikes, Kelloggs fired all the striking workers and posted their jobs in December after negotiations with the BCTGM union failed. During the talks, Kelloggs had threatened to move jobs to Mexico if the union did not agree to Kelloggs' proposal.[116] Kelloggs also filed a lawsuit against the union.[117] As a result, several calls for a boycott went viral.[118][119]\n\n\n\n## Political involvement[edit]\n\n\n### Genetically modified foods labelling[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's donated around US$2 million opposing California Proposition 37, a 2012 ballot initiative that, if enacted, would have required compulsory labeling of genetically engineered food products.[120] In March 2016, though, they vowed to label all of their products with genetically modified organisms as such by 2020.[121]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Kellogg's called on the President to support the Paris Agreement on climate change.[122] In 2016, Kellogg Company urged President-elect Donald Trump to \"continue the Paris Climate Agreement\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Voter ID laws[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has donated to notable groups opposing voter-ID laws, such as the Applied Research Center (now RaceForward).[124] The company also decided to remove their advertisements from the Breitbart News website.[125] Breitbart News in turn called for a boycott of Kellogg's products.[126]\n\n\n\n### Education grant[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Kellogg's gave the Calhoun School a $250,000 grant for a \"three-part youth-based project on issues of white privilege and institutionalized racism\".[127]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Trafford Park factory in Greater Manchester, England\u2014Kellogg's European base since 1938.[4] The factory produces more Corn Flakes than any other Kellogg's factory in the world.[128]\n* Australia:\n\t+ Pagewood[129]\n\t+ Charmhaven (snack and cereal plant closed in 2014.)[130]\n* Belgium: Zaventem & Mechelen plant\n* Brazil: S\u00e3o Paulo\n* Colombia: Bogot\u00e1\n* Canada:\n\t+ Mississauga, Ontario \u2013 Canadian head office\n\t+ Anjou, Quebec \u2013 Eastern Canada sales office\n\t+ Calgary, Alberta \u2013 Western Canada sales office\n\t+ London, Ontario \u2013 manufacturers and distributes cereals (including Corn Flakes) in Canada.

By 1963, loads of 'Khampa *tsampa* ' were being shipped to the Roof of the World.\n62. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Comedy News, Viral Videos, Late Night TV, Political Humor, Funny Slideshows\". *The Huffington Post*.

It is traditionally eaten as part of breakfast, or a snack food, primarily in Western societies.\n\n\nAlthough warm cereals like oatmeal and grits have the longest history, ready-to-eat cold cereals appeared around the late 19th century and are most often served with dairy products, traditionally cow's milk. They can also be paired with yogurt or plant-based milks, or eaten plain. Fruit or nuts are sometimes added. Many cereals are produced via extrusion.\n\n\nSome companies promote their products for the health benefits that come from eating oat-based and high-fiber cereals. In the United States, cereals are often fortified with vitamins but can still lack many of the vitamins needed for a healthy breakfast. A significant proportion of cereals have a high sugar content (\"sugar cereals\" or \"sugary cereals\" in common parlance). These cereals are frequently marketed towards children and often feature a cartoon mascot and may contain a toy or prize.\n\n\nBetween 1970 and 1998, the number of different types of breakfast cereals in the U.S. more than doubled, from about 160 to around 340; as of 2012[update], there were roughly 4,945 different types (estimate based on the mass customization of online shopping).[1] In this highly competitive market, cereal companies have developed an ever-increasing number of varieties and flavors (some are flavored like dessert or candy). Although many plain wheat-, oat- and corn-based cereals exist, many other varieties are highly sweetened, while some brands include freeze-dried fruit as a sweet element. The breakfast cereal industry has gross profit margins of 40\u201345%,[2] 90% penetration in some markets,[3] and has had steady and continued growth throughout its history.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nCereal grains, namely porridge (and especially oatmeal), became an important breakfast component in North America. Barley was a commonly used grain, though other grains and yellow peas could be used. In many modern cultures, porridge is still eaten as a breakfast dish.\n\n\n\n### Early America[edit]\n\n\nNative Americans had found a way to make ground corn palatable, later called *grits* (from the Old English word *gr\u0113ot*, meaning \"gravel\").[5] *Hominy* was another preparation. While this became a staple in the southern U.S., grits never gained a hold in the northern states.[6] Food reformers in the 19th century called for cutting back on excessive meat consumption at breakfast. They explored numerous vegetarian alternatives. Late in the century, the Seventh-day Adventists based in Michigan made these food reforms part of their religion, and non-meat breakfasts were featured in their sanitariums and led to new breakfast cereals.[7]\n\n\n\n### Cooked oatmeal[edit]\n\n\nFerdinand Schumacher, a German immigrant, began the cereals revolution in 1854 with a hand oats grinder in the back room of a small store in Akron, Ohio. His German Mills American Oatmeal Company was the nation's first commercial oatmeal manufacturer. He marketed the product locally as a substitute for breakfast pork. Improved production technology (steel cutters, porcelain rollers, improved hullers), combined with an influx of German and Irish immigrants, quickly boosted sales and profits.\n\n\n\n![](image)A Quaker Oats advertisement circa 1900\nIn 1877, Schumacher adopted the Quaker symbol, the first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal. The acceptance of \"horse food\" for human consumption encouraged other entrepreneurs to enter the industry. Henry Parsons Crowell started operations in 1882, and John Robert Stuart in 1885.[8] Crowell cut costs by consolidating every step of the processing\u2014grading, cleaning, hulling, cutting, rolling, packaging, and shipping\u2014in one factory operating at Ravenna, Ohio. Stuart operated mills in Chicago and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Stuart and Crowell combined in 1885 and initiated a price war. After a fire at his mill in Akron, Schumacher joined Stuart and Crowell to form the Consolidated Oatmeal Company.\n\n\nThe American Cereal Company (Quaker Oats, but see below) created a cereal made from oats in 1877, manufacturing the product in Akron, Ohio.[9] Separately, in 1888, a trust or holding company combined the nation's seven largest mills into the American Cereal Company using the Quaker Oats brand name. By 1900, technology, entrepreneurship, and the \"Man in Quaker Garb\"\u2014a symbol of plain honesty and reliability\u2014gave Quaker Oats a national market and annual sales of $10 million (equivalent to $370 million today).[10]\n\n\nEarly in the 20th century, the Quaker Oats Company (formed in 1901 to replace the American Cereal Company) ventured into the world market. Schumacher, the innovator; Stuart, the manager and financial leader; and Crowell, the creative merchandiser, advertiser, and promoter, doubled sales every decade. Alexander P. Anderson's steam-pressure method of shooting rice from guns created puffed rice and puffed wheat. Crowell's intensive advertising campaign in the 1920s and 1930s featured promotions with such celebrities as Babe Ruth, Max Baer, and Shirley Temple. Sponsorship of the popular *Rin-Tin-Tin* and *Sergeant Preston of the Yukon* radio shows aided the company's expansion during the depression. Meat rationing during World War II boosted annual sales to $90 million (equivalent to $1.5 billion today), and by 1956 sales topped $277 million ($3.1 billion today). By 1964 the firm sold over 200 products, grossed over $500 million ($4.9 billion today), and claimed that eight million people ate Quaker Oats each day. Expansion included the acquisition of Aunt Jemima Mills Company in 1926, which continues as a leading brand of pancake mixes and syrup, the sport drink Gatorade in 1983, and in 1986, the Golden Grain Company, producers of Rice-A-Roni canned lunch food. In 2001 Quaker Oats was itself bought out by PepsiCo.[11]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\nThe first cold breakfast cereal, Granula (not the same as granola), was invented in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson, operator of Our Home on the Hillside which was later replaced by the Jackson Sanatorium in Dansville, New York. The cereal never became popular, due to the inconvenient necessity of tenderizing the heavy bran and graham nuggets by soaking them overnight.[12][13][14]\n\n\nGeorge H. Hoyt created Wheatena circa 1879, during an era when retailers would typically buy cereal (the most popular being cracked wheat, oatmeal, and cerealine) in barrel lots, and scoop it out to sell by the pound to customers. Hoyt, who had found a distinctive process of preparing wheat for cereal, sold his cereal in boxes, offering consumers a more sanitary and consumer-friendly option.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Kellogg and Battle Creek, Michigan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1910 Kellogg's Corn Flakes advertisement\nPackaged breakfast cereals were considerably more convenient than a product that had to be cooked, and as a result of this convenience (and clever marketing), they became popular. Battle Creek, Michigan, was a center both of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and of innovation in the ready-to-eat cereal industry, and indeed, the church had a substantial impact on the development of cereal goods through the person of John Harvey Kellogg (1851\u20131943). Son of an Adventist factory owner in Battle Creek, Kellogg was encouraged by his church to train in medicine at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City in 1875. After graduating, he became medical superintendent at the Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek, established in 1866 by the Adventists to offer their natural remedies for illness. Many wealthy industrialists came to Kellogg's sanitarium for recuperation and rejuvenation.\n\n\nIn Battle Creek sanitarium guests found fresh air, exercise, rest, hydrotherapy, a strict vegetarian diet, and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. (They were accustomed to breakfasts of ham, eggs, sausages, fried potatoes, hot biscuits, hotcakes (pancakes), and coffee.) To supplement the center's vegetarian regimen, Kellogg experimented with granola. Soon afterwards he began to experiment with wheat, resulting in a lighter, flakier product. In 1891 he acquired a patent and then in 1895 he launched the Cornflakes brand, which overnight captured a national market. Soon there were forty rival manufacturers in the Battle Creek area. His brother William K. Kellogg (1860\u20131951) worked for him for many years until, in 1906, he broke away, bought the rights to Cornflakes, and set up the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company. William Kellogg discarded the health food concept, opting for heavy advertising and commercial taste appeal. Later, his signature on every package became the company trademark.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n### Charles W. Post[edit]\n\n\nThe second major innovator in the cereal industry was Charles W. Post, a salesman who was admitted to Kellogg's sanitarium as a patient in the late 1800s. While there, he grew deeply impressed with their all-grain diet. Upon his release, he began experimenting with grain products, beginning with an all-grain coffee substitute called Postum. In 1897 (or 1898) he introduced Grape-nuts, the concentrated cereal with a nutty flavor (containing neither grapes nor nuts). Good business sense, determination, and powerful advertising produced a multimillion-dollar fortune for Post in a few years. After his death, his company acquired the Jell-O company in 1925, Baker's Chocolate in 1927, Maxwell House coffee in 1928, and Birdseye frozen foods in 1929. In 1929, the company changed its name to General Foods. In 1985, Philip Morris Tobacco Company bought General Foods for $5.6 billion (equivalent to $15.9 billion today) and merged it with its Kraft division.[20] Because of Kellogg and Post, the city of Battle Creek, Michigan, is nicknamed the \"Cereal Capital of the World\".[21]\n\n\n\n### Muesli[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Muesli\n\nMuesli is a breakfast cereal based on uncooked rolled oats, fruit, and nuts. It was developed around 1900 by the Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital.[22] It is available in a packaged dry form such as Alpen or Familia Swiss M\u00fcesli, or it can be made fresh.\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nIn 1902, Force wheat flakes became the first ready-to-eat breakfast cereal introduced into the United Kingdom. The cereal, and the Sunny Jim character, achieved wide success in Britain, at its peak in 1930 selling 12.5 million packages in one year.\n\n\n\n### National advertising[edit]\n\n\nKellogg began the breakfast cereal marketing and introduced the first in-box prize in the early 1900s.[23] Quaker Oats entered the market with Puffed Rice and Wheat Berries it had introduced at the 1904 World Fair, with raw grains shot with hot compressed air from tubes, popping up to many times their size.[24] They were marketed as a revolution in food science.[23] In the 1920s, national advertising in magazines and radio broadcasts played a key role in the emergence of the fourth big cereal manufacturer, General Mills. In 1921, James Ford Bell, president of a Minneapolis wheat milling firm, began experimenting with rolled wheat flakes. After tempering, steaming, cracking wheat, and processing it with syrup, sugar, and salt, it was prepared in a pressure cooker for rolling and then dried in an electric oven. By 1925, Wheaties had become the \"Breakfast of Champions\". In 1928, four milling companies consolidated as the General Mills Company in Minneapolis. The new firm expanded packaged food sales with heavy advertising, including sponsorship of radio programs such as \"Skippy\", \"Jack Armstrong, The All-American Boy\", and baseball games. Jack Dempsey, Johnny Weissmuller, and others verified the \"Breakfast of Champions\" slogan. By 1941 Wheaties had won 12% percent of the cereal market. Experiments with the puffing process produced Kix, a puffed corn cereal, and Cheerios, a puffed oats cereal. Further product innovation and diversification brought total General Mills sales to over $500 million annually (18% in packaged foods) by the early 1950s.[25][26] In 1944 General Foods launched a marketing campaign for Grape Nuts, focusing on nutritional importance of breakfast.[19]\n\n\n\n### Sugar cereals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breakfast cereals primarily marketed to children, such as Froot Loops, are commonly brightly colored and high in sugar.\nAfter World War II, the big breakfast cereal companies\u2014now including General Mills, who entered the market in 1924 with Wheaties\u2014increasingly started to target children. The flour was refined to remove fiber, which at the time was considered to undermine digestion and absorption of nutrients, and sugar was added to improve the flavor for children. The new breakfast cereals began to look starkly different from their ancestors. Ranger Joe, the first pre-sweetened breakfast cereal of sugar-coated puffed wheat or rice, was introduced in the US in 1939.[27] Kellogg's Sugar Smacks, created in 1953, had 56% sugar by weight.[28] Different mascots were introduced, such as the Rice Krispies elves[29] and later pop icons like Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit.\n\n\n\n### Granola[edit]\n\n\nMain article: granola\n\nIn the 1960s, the modern version of granola was invented and popularized. It evolved from a product called Granula (similar to Grape Nuts) to the recognizable modern form involving at a minimum: sweetened toasted oats, but also possibly: dried fruit, puffed rice, nuts or chocolate.\n\n\n\n### Modern cereal[edit]\n\n\nOver 2016 to 2017, Americans purchased 3.1 billion boxes of cereal, mostly as ready to eat cold cereal.[30] In a $9.8 billion cereal market, cold cereal purchases were 88% of the total (12% for hot cereals), with the overall cereal market declining due to reduced consumption of sugar and dairy products.[30] Kellogg's and General Mills each had 30% of the market share for cold cereals. Honey Nut Cheerios was the leading cold cereal.[30]\n\n\n\n## Processing of grains[edit]\n\n\nThe processing of grains helps to separate the bran and cereal germ, but may remove nutrients, such as B vitamins and dietary fiber.[31] Processing is the modification of a grain or mixture of grains usually taking place in a facility remote from the location where the product is eaten. This distinguishes \"breakfast cereals\" from foods made from grains modified and cooked in the place where they are eaten.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Nutritional fortification[edit]\n\n\nBreakfast cereals may be fortified with dietary minerals and vitamins. For example, breakfast cereal in Canada may be fortified with specific micronutrient amounts per 100 grams of cereal, including thiamin, (2.0\u00a0mg), niacin (4.8\u00a0mg), and vitamin B6 (0.6\u00a0mg), among others.[32]\n\n\n\n## Gluten-free cereals[edit]\n\n\nBreakfast cereal companies make gluten-free cereals which are free of any gluten-containing grains. These cereals are targeted for consumers who suffer from gluten-related disorders, as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy, among others.[33][34] Some companies that produce gluten-free cereals include Kellogg's, General Mills, Nature's Path and Arrowhead Mills.\n\n\n\n## Warm cereals[edit]\n\n\nMost warm cereals can be classified as porridges, in that they consist of cereal grains which are soaked in hot water, cooked and/or boiled to soften them and make them palatable. Sweeteners, such as brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup, are often added either by the manufacturer, during cooking, or before eating. Porridge is especially popular in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and England. Porridge became important in Scotland due to the freezing winters. The Scottish people prefer porridge to be made with only water and salt while other prefer creamier substances to be added. Wales had a perfect climate for cultivating oats making porridge common in Welsh households. Ireland mixes porridge with whiskey as a cure for the common cold while England references the dish to the royal family and their traditions.[35]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nCommon hot cereals in parts of Canada include oatmeal, Cream of Wheat (and Cream of Rice) and Red River cereal. These hot cereals are typically served with maple syrup or brown sugar and milk or cream. Yogurt is also added to Red River cereal. Many Canadians also enjoy cereals similar to those in the United States market.\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nIn China, porridges such as rice congee, or those made with other ingredients (including corn meal or millet) are often eaten for breakfast. Eating breakfast cereal has become more important in China and specifically Hong Kong due to the increase of work and decrease in time.[36]\n\n\n\n### Greece[edit]\n\n\nIn Greece, cornmeal is poured into boiling milk to create a cereal of a thick consistency which is often served to young children. The cereal production in Greece has recently declined.[37]\n\n\n\n### Ireland[edit]\n\n\nOatmeal is a common breakfast in Ireland. Oatmeal and porridge have been consumed in Ireland since the 19th century.[35]\n\n\n\n### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn Russia, a breakfast is kasha, a porridge of buckwheat (Russian: \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430, romanized:\u00a0*grechka*), farina (Russian: \u043c\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430, romanized:\u00a0*manka*), or other grains. Kasha is found throughout much of Eastern Europe, including Poland and Croatia. Russia does not value breakfast cereals as much as other places. Most instances of cereal consumption is due to the desire for weight loss.[38]\n\n\n\n### South Africa[edit]\n\n\nPap is a porridge used in a variety of meals eaten throughout the day. In the Afrikaans culture of descendants of Dutch farmers and French Huguenots, it is usually sprinkled with sugar and then eaten with milk; it can be made to a very stiff consistency so that it forms\u2014what could be described as\u2014a softish lumpy crumble (called *krummel-pap*) or a more creamy porridge consistency (called *slap-pap*). It is generally made from maize (\"mielie\") meal and is sold under various brand names. Taystee Wheat is made into a creamy wheat-based porridge. Porridge brands unique to South Africa include Jungle Oats and Bokomo Maltabella (made from malted sorghum).[39] In other parts of Africa it is known as *ugali*, *bota*, and *banku* or \"makkau\".\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nScotland is famous for its consumption of oats. In Northern Ireland, the company White's has been milling oats in Tandragee since 1841.[40] England has incorporated porridge in their culture for centuries. Many of the different types of porridge were made specially for the royal family including a type of porridge called \"pea porridge\". This specific dish was made for King Richard II.[35]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nConsumption of breakfast cereal is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases.[41][42]\nRegular breakfast cereal consumption is associated with less risk of being overweight or obese and high-fiber breakfast cereals are associated with a lower risk of diabetes.[41]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Food portal\n\n\n* Cereal box prize\n* List of breakfast cereal advertising characters\n* List of breakfast cereals\n* List of breakfast topics\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Aichner T, Coletti P (2013). \"Customers' online shopping preferences in mass customization\". *Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice*. **15** (1): 20\u201335. doi:10.1057/dddmp.2013.34.\n2. **^** \nLawrence, Felicity (28 December 2006). \"How constipation cure became huge business\". *The Guardian*.

It was introduced in the United States, in 1952,[1] as \"Sugar Frosted Flakes\". The word \"sugar\" was dropped from the name in 1983. \n\n\nGeneric versions, such as store brands, are also available. Unlike many cereals, such as Cheerios, Shreddies and Rice Krispies, the name \u201cFrosted Flakes\u201d is so generic that it cannot be trademarked, and thus it often shares its name with competitors.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## International names[edit]\n\n\n\n\nNutritional info| Nutritional value per 1 cup (29\u00a0grams) |\n| --- |\n| Energy | 460\u00a0kJ (110\u00a0kcal) |\n|  |\n| **Carbohydrates**\n | 26 (9%)\n |\n| Sugars | 10\u00a0g |\n| Dietary fiber | <1\u00a0g (73%) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Fat**\n | 0\u00a0g (10%)\n |\n| Saturated | 0\u00a0g (7%) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Protein**\n | 1\u00a0g (2%)\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Other constituents** | **Quantity** |\n| Calories from fat | 942\u00a0kJ (225\u00a0kcal) |\n| Cholesterol | 0 mg (0%) |\n|  |\n| \n\n---\n\nValues may be different outside US market.\n |\n| \u2020Percentages estimated using US\u00a0recommendations for adults,[3] except for potassium, which is estimated based on expert recommendation from the National Academies.[4]Source: [1] |\n\n\n* **Frosted Flakes** (U.S. and Canada)\n* **Frosties** (UK, Ireland, Australia, Israel, most Commonwealth nations, and European and Middle East countries; formerly **Frostis** in Spain)\n* **Zucaritas** in the U.S. and Hispanic America (the word translates as \"little sugary things\")\n* **Sucrilhos** in Brazil (a fusion of sugar + crunch + milho)\n* **Corn Frosty** (\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u30d5\u30ed\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3) in Japan\n* **Corn Frost** (\ucf58\ud478\ub85c\uc2a4\ud2b8) in South Korea\n\n\n## Popularity[edit]\n\n\nFrosted Flakes was the second-best-selling cereal in the first half of 2017 within the US in gross sales, after Honey Nut Cheerios. [5]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nTony the Tiger has been the mascot of Frosted Flakes since its introduction. Tony is known for saying the cereal's slogan: \"They're Gr-r-reat!\" (the \"r\"s in \"Great\" being drawn-out). Tony the Tiger was originally voiced by Dallas McKennon, but Thurl Ravenscroft voiced him for more than 50 years, until his death in 2005. Tony was later voiced (in Canada and the US) by former professional wrestling play-by-play announcer Lee Marshall[6] until his death on April 27, 2014.[7] After Marshall's death, he was replaced with Tex Brashear. In the UK, Tom Hill voiced Tony after Ravenscroft's death. Tony is drawn wearing a red bandana on all Frosted Flakes cereal boxes.\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n* Kellogg's was a major sponsor of *Adventures of Superman* throughout most of the 1950s. Many of the Frosted Flakes commercials featuring the show's star George Reeves are available on the DVD release of the series' first season.\n* Frosted Flakes is a sponsor of Challenger Sports British Soccer Camps.[8]\n* From the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s, Frosted Flakes was a sponsor of children's programming on PBS, including *Sagwa*, *Dragon Tales* and *Barney & Friends*.\n\n\n### Varieties[edit]\n\n\nIn Canada and the United States:\n\n\n\n* **Frosted Rice**, a crisped rice variant introduced in 1977, similar to **Frosted Rice Krispies** and **Ricicles**.

Kellogg's produces cereal (outside North America) and convenience foods, including crackers and toaster pastries, and markets their products by several well-known brands including the Kellogg's brand itself, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, Eggo, and Cheez-It, along with cereal internationally such as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Coco Pops.\n\n\nKellogg's products are manufactured and marketed in over 180 countries.[3] Kellogg's largest factory is at Trafford Park in Trafford, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, which is also the location of its UK headquarters.[4] Other corporate office locations outside of Battle Creek include Chicago, Dublin (European Headquarters), Shanghai, and Quer\u00e9taro City.[5] Kellogg's held a Royal Warrant from Queen Elizabeth II until her death in 2022.[6]\n\n\nKellogg's was split into two companies on October 2, 2023, with WK Kellogg Co owning the North American cereal division, and the existing company being rebranded to **Kellanova**, owning brands such as Pop-Tarts and Pringles alongside the international cereal division. Kellogg's itself would become a brand name of both companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Will Keith Kellogg\n\n![](image)First Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Co. corn flakes package (1906), later to become the Kellogg Food Company in 1908\nIn 1876, John Harvey Kellogg became the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium (originally the Western Health Reform Institute founded by Ellen White) and his brother, W. K. Kellogg, worked as the bookkeeper. This is where corn flakes were created and led to the eventual formation of the Kellogg Company.\n\n\nFor years, W. K. Kellogg assisted his brother in research to improve the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played.[7] It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the following day, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked.[7]\n\n\nW. K. Kellogg persuaded his brother to serve the food in a flake form. Soon the flaked wheat was being packaged to meet hundreds of guest mail-order requests after they left the Sanitarium. However, Dr. John Harvey forbade his brother Will from distributing cereal beyond his consumers. As a result, the brothers fell out, and W. K. launched the **Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company** on February 19, 1906.[8][9] On July 4, 1907, a fire destroyed the main factory building. W.K. Kellogg had the new plant in full operation six months after the fire.[10]\n\n\nConvincing his brother to relinquish rights to the product, Will's company produced and marketed the hugely successful Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes and was renamed the **Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company** in 1909, taking on the current name of the **Kellogg Company** in 1922.[8]\n\n\nBy 1909, Will's company produced 120,000 cases of Corn Flakes daily. John, who resented his brother's success, filed suit against Will's company in 1906 for the right to use the family name. The resulting legal battle, which included a trial that lasted an entire month, ended in December 1920 when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in Will's favor.[11]\n\n\nIn 1931, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks from the usual 40. W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed to support people through the depression era. This practice remained until World War II and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980.[12]\n\n\nIn 1964, Kellogg's introduced its first non-cereal product. A pastry which can be heated in a toaster called Pop-Tarts.[13]\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970, the slogan \u201cKellogg's puts more into your day\u201d was used on Sunday morning TV shows. From 1969 to 1977, Kellogg's acquired various small businesses, including Salada Tea, Fearn International, Mrs. Smith's Pies, Eggo, and Pure Packed Foods;[14] however, it was later criticized for not diversifying further like General Mills and Quaker Oats were. After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's US market share hit a low of 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \"a fine company that's past its prime\" and the cereal market was being regarded as \"mature\". Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers aged 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior. The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, worth $3.7 billion at retail in 1983, totaled $5.4 billion by 1988 and had expanded three times as fast as the average grocery category. Kellogg's also introduced new products, including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits, and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post, which had difficulty in the adult cereal market.[15]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion.[16] Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.[17]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kellogg's became the world's second-largest snack food company (after PepsiCo) by acquiring the potato crisps brand Pringles from Procter & Gamble for $2.7 billion in a cash deal.[18]\n\n\nIn 2017, Kellogg's acquired Chicago-based food company Rxbar for $654 million.[19] Earlier that year, Kellogg's also opened new corporate office space in Chicago's Merchandise Mart for its global growth and IT departments.[20] In the UK, Kellogg's also released the W. K. Kellogg brand of organic, vegan and plant-based cereals (such as granolas, organic wholegrain wheat, and \"super grains\") with no added sugars.[21]\n\n\nIn 2018, Kellogg's decided to cease their operations in Venezuela due to the economic crisis the country is facing.[22] Their factories were taken by the Venezuelan state under the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro administration. In mid-2019, Venezuelan Kellogg's cereal boxes began portraying the Venezuelan flag and a motto from Maduro: \"Together, everything is possible\" (Spanish: *Juntos todo es posible*) alongside Kellogg's logo and mascots were sold all over the country. Kellogg's considers it as an illicit use, and the company stated they would take legal action.[23]\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, it was announced that Kellogg's was selling Famous Amos, Murray's, Keebler, Mother's, and Little Brownie Bakers (one of the producers of the cookies for the Girl Scouts of the USA) to Ferrero SpA for $1.4 billion.[24][25][26] On July 29, 2019, that sale was completed.[27] Kellogg's kept the Keebler cracker line and replaced the Keebler name on their crackers with the Kellogg's name.\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kellogg's announced their next-generation *Kellogg's\u00ae Better Days* global commitment, focusing on hunger, children, and farmers, with specific targets to reach by 2030.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Kellogg's partnered with GLAAD by \"launching a new limited edition \"All Together Cereal\" and donating $50,000 to support GLAAD's anti-bullying and LGBTQ advocacy efforts\". The All Together cereal combined six mini cereal boxes into one package to bring attention to anti-bullying.[29]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Kellogg's decided to work with suppliers to phase out the use of glyphosate by 2025, which some farmers have used as a drying agent for wheat and oats supplied to Kellogg's.[30]\n\n\nIn October 2021, workers at all of Kellogg's cereal-producing plants in the United States went on a strike conducted by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union over disagreements over the terms of a new labor contract.[31] On December 3, 2021, a tentative deal was struck to end the worker strike,[32] but the union members overwhelmingly rejected the tentative agreement[33] and Kellogg's management announced they would seek to replace all 1,400 striking workers.[34] On December 21, 2021, about 1,400 Kellogg workers approved a collective bargaining agreement, ending the strike, which had lasted 77 days.[35][36][37]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2022, Kellogg's announced that the company would spin off three cereal, snacks, and plant-based food divisions.[38][39] The North American cereal and plant-based food spin-off companies will keep Battle Creek as their headquarters and the new snack and international cereal company will be based in Chicago.[40] The successor company, known as Global Snacking Co. temporarily, represents 80 percent or $11.4 billion of Kellogg's sales. 60 percent of Global Snacking's business was snacks, and nearly half of the company's business was in the United States. The cereal business, temporarily called North America Cereal Co., would be the second-largest American cereal company and the largest in Canada and the Caribbean, with 5 of the top 11 brands and $2.4 billion in annual sales. Plant-based foods, representing $340 million in annual sales, would be called \"Plant Co.\" and could even be sold.[41] In January 2023, Kellogg's shelved its plans to spin off its plant food business and would retain it as part of Global Snacking Co.[42] On March 15, 2023, Kellogg's announced that North America Cereal Co. branch will be named WK Kellogg Co and Global Snacking Co. branch will be called Kellanova.

Foremost among these is the design of the Kellogg's logo by Ferris Crane under the art direction of famed type guru Y. Ames. Another was the well-remembered jingle \"K E double-L, O double-good, Kellogg's best to you!\".\n\n\nWith the rising popularity of patent medicine in early 20th century advertising, The Kellogg Company of Canada published a book named *A New Way of Living* that showed readers \"how to achieve a new way of living; how to preserve vitality; how to maintain enthusiasm and energy; how to get the most out of life because of a physical ability to enjoy it\". It touted the All-Bran cereal as the secret to leading \"normal\" lives free of constipation.[82]\n\n\nKellogg's was a major sponsor throughout the run of the hit CBS panel show *What's My Line?*[83] It and its associated products Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies were also major sponsors for the PBS Kids children's animated series *Dragon Tales*.[84]\n\n\nKellogg's is a sponsor of USA Gymnastics and produced the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics, a 36-city tour held in 2016 after the Olympic games and featured performances by recent medal-winning gymnasts from the United States.[85]\n\n\nKellogg's is currently the title sponsor of three college football bowl games. First, it was announced in 2019 that Kellogg's would become the new title sponsor of the Sun Bowl game, with the game being branded as the \"Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl\".[86] This was followed in 2020 by the company using its Cheez-It brand to sponsor of the game now known as the Pop-Tarts Bowl.[87] In 2022, Kellogg's added the Citrus Bowl to its bowl sponsorships, with the game branded as the \"Cheez-It Citrus Bowl\".[88]\n\n\n\n### Premiums and prizes[edit]\n\n\nW.K. Kellogg was the first to introduce prizes in boxes of cereal. The marketing strategy that he established has produced thousands of different cereal box prizes that have been distributed by the tens of billions.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Children's premiums[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1909, Kellogg's Corn Flakes had the first cereal premium with *The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book.* The book was originally available as a prize that was given to the customer in the store with the purchase of two packages of the cereal.[90] But in 1909, Kellogg's changed the book giveaway to a premium mail-in offer for the cost of a dime. Over 2.5 million copies of the book were distributed in different editions over a period of 23 years.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Cereal box prizes[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, Kellogg's inserted a prize in the form of pin-back buttons into each box of Pep cereal. Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics and were available through 1947. There were five series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection.[89] Other manufacturers of major brands of cereal, including General Mills, Malt-O-Meal, Nestl\u00e9, Post Foods, and Quaker Oats, followed suit and inserted prizes into boxes of cereal to promote sales and brand loyalty.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nLicensed brands have been omitted since the corresponding mascots would be obvious (for example, Spider-Man is the mascot for Spider-Man Spidey-Berry).\n\n\n\n* Cocoa Hoots cereal: Newton the Owl\n* Cocoa Krispies cereal (Known as Choco Krispis in Latin America, Choco Krispies in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Switzerland, Chocos in India, and Coco Pops in Australia, the UK, and Europe): Jose (monkey), Coco (monkey), Melvin (elephant), Snagglepuss (Hanna-Barbera character), Ogg (caveman), Tusk (elephant), and Snap, Crackle and Pop (who were also, and remain as of February 2014, the Rice Krispies mascots; see below)\n* Corn Flakes cereal: Cornelius (rooster)\n* Frosted Flakes (known as Frosties outside the US/Canada, Zucaritas in Latin America and Sucrilhos in Brazil) cereal: Tony the Tiger\n* Froot Loops cereal: Toucan Sam\n* Honey Smacks (US)/Smacks (other markets) cereal: Dig 'Em Frog\n* Raisin Bran cereal: Sunny the Sun\n* Rice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) cereal: Snap, Crackle and Pop\n* Ricicles (UK Only) cereal: Captain Rik\n* Apple Jacks cereal: CinnaMon and Bad Apple\n* Honey Loops cereal: Loopy (bumblebee), Pops (honey bee)\n* Keebler cookies and crackers: Ernie and the Elves\n\n### Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's made its first foray into auto racing between 1991 and 1992 when the company sponsored the #41 Chevrolets fielded by Larry Hedrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series and driven by Phil Parsons, Dave Marcis, Greg Sacks, Hut Stricklin, and Richard Petty, but they gained greater prominence for their sponsorship of two-time Winston Cup Champion Terry Labonte from 1993 to 2006, the last 12 years of that as the sponsor for Hendrick Motorsports' No.5 car. Kellogg's sponsored the No.5 car for Labonte, Kyle Busch, Casey Mears, and Mark Martin until 2010, and it then served as an associate sponsor for Carl Edwards' #99 car for Roush Fenway Racing.\n\n\nKellogg's placed Dale Earnhardt on Kellogg's Corn Flakes boxes for 1993 six-time Winston Cup champion and 1994 seven-time Winston Cup champion, as well as Jeff Gordon on the Mini Wheats box for the 1993 Rookie of the Year, 1995 Brickyard 400 inaugural race, 1997 Champion, and 1998 three-time champion, and a special three-pack racing box set with Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte, and Dale Jarrett in 1996.\n\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has used some merchandising for their products. Kellogg's once released *Mission Nutrition*, a PC game that came free with special packs of cereal. It played in a similar fashion as *Donkey Kong Country*; users could play as Tony the Tiger, Coco the Monkey, or Snap, Crackle, and Pop. Kellogg's has also released \"Talking\" games. The two current versions are Talking Tony and Talking Sam. In these games, a microphone is used to play games and create voice commands for their computers. In Talking Tony, Tony the Tiger, one of Kellogg's most famous mascots, would be the main and only character in the game. In Talking Sam, Toucan Sam, another famous mascot, would be in the game, instead. Some [toy cars] have the Kellogg's logo on them, and occasionally their mascots.\n\n\nThere was also a Talking Snap Crackle and Pop software.\n\n\n\n### Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's frequently partners with the Olympic Games to feature American athletes from the Olympic Games on the packages of their cereal brands.[92] In 2017, the company announced its marketing campaign for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games featuring American athletes Nathan Chen, Kelly Clark, Meghan Duggan and Mike Schultz.[93]\n\n\n\n## Misleading claims[edit]\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\n> \n> We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims\u2014not once, but twice\u2014that its cereals improve children's health...\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the F.T.C.[94]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Kellogg's was found to be making unsubstantiated and misleading claims in advertising their cereal products by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).[94][95][96]\n\n\nKellogg's responded by stating \"We stand behind the validity of our product claims and research, so we agreed to an order that covers those claims. We believe that the revisions to the existing consent agreement satisfied any remaining concerns.\"[96]\n\n\nThe FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved kids' attentiveness by nearly 20%.[97]\n\n\nThe Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has also suggested that the language on Kellogg Pop-Tarts packages saying the pastries are \"Made with Real Fruit\" should be taken off the products.[98] In July 2012, the UK banned a \"Special K\" advertisement due to its citing caloric values that did not take into account the caloric value of milk consumed with the cereal.[99] In 2016 an ad telling UK consumers that Special K is \u201cfull of goodness\u201d and \u201cnutritious\u201d was banned.[100]\n\n\n\n### Questionable nutritional value[edit]\n\n\nSome of Kellogg's marketing has been questioned in the press, prompted by an increase in consumer awareness of the mismatch between the marketing messages and the products themselves.[101]\n\n\nFood bloggers are also questioning the marketing methods used by cereal manufacturing companies such as Kellogg's, due to their high sugar content and use of ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2021 Pop-Tarts lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA class-action lawsuit was filed against Kellogg's in October 2021 claiming they are not putting enough strawberries in their strawberry flavored Pop-Tarts, and seeking $5 million in damages.[103] In April 2022, the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge.[104]\n\n\nAnother lawsuit was filed against Kellog's in 2021, with the plaintiff claiming that Kellogg's defrauded customers regarding the contents of its Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts. The plaintiff stated she would not have purchased the Pop-Tarts had she known they did not contain milk, milkfat, or butter. In June 2022, a US district judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating that a reasonable consumer would not expect those ingredients.[105]\n\n\n\n## Recalls[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, the company voluntarily began to recall about 28 million boxes of Apple Jacks, Corn Pops, Froot Loops and Honey Smacks because of an unusual smell and flavor from the packages' liners that could make people ill. Kellogg's said about 20 people complained about the cereals, including five who reported nausea and vomiting. Consumers reported the cereal smelled or tasted waxy or like metal or soap. Company spokeswoman J. Adaire Putnam said some described it as tasting stale. However, no serious health problems had been reported.[106]\n\n\nThe suspected chemical that caused the illnesses was 2-methylnaphthalene, used in the cereal packaging process. Little is known about 2-methylnaphthalene's impact on human health as the Food and Drug Administration has no scientific data on its impact on humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also does not have health and safety data. This is despite the EPA having sought information on it from the chemical industry for 16 years. 2-Methylnaphthalene is a component of crude oil and is \"structurally related to naphthalene, an ingredient in mothballs and toilet-deodorant blocks\" that the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen.[107][108]\n\n\n*Kellogg's* offered consumers refunds in the meantime.[109] Only products with the letters \"KN\" following the use-by date were included in the recall.[110] The products were distributed throughout the US and began arriving in stores in late March 2010. Products in Canada were not affected.[111]\n\n\n\n### 2012 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's issued a voluntary recall of some of its \"Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size Original\" and \"Mini-Wheats Unfrosted Bite Size\" products due to the possibility of flexible metal mesh fragments in the food. The affected products varied in size from single-serving bowls to large 70-ounce cartons. Use-by dates printed on the recalled packages ranged from April 1, 2013, to September 21, 2013, and were accompanied by the letters KB, AP or FK.[112]\n\n\n\n## Human rights violations and strikes[edit]\n\n\n### Human right violations of palm oil in 2016[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Amnesty International in 2016, Kellogg's palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14-year-old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from chemicals such as Paraquat.[113][114] Kellogg's alleged not being aware of the child abuses due to traceability; Amnesty's human rights director replied that \"Using mealy-mouthed excuses about 'traceability' is a total cop-out.\"[115]\n\n\n\n### 2021 strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Kellogg's strike\n\nIn October 2021, over a thousand employees at four Kelloggs manufacturing plants in the United States went on strike for better working conditions and higher wages. Two months into the strikes, Kelloggs fired all the striking workers and posted their jobs in December after negotiations with the BCTGM union failed. During the talks, Kelloggs had threatened to move jobs to Mexico if the union did not agree to Kelloggs' proposal.[116] Kelloggs also filed a lawsuit against the union.[117] As a result, several calls for a boycott went viral.[118][119]\n\n\n\n## Political involvement[edit]\n\n\n### Genetically modified foods labelling[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's donated around US$2 million opposing California Proposition 37, a 2012 ballot initiative that, if enacted, would have required compulsory labeling of genetically engineered food products.[120] In March 2016, though, they vowed to label all of their products with genetically modified organisms as such by 2020.[121]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Kellogg's called on the President to support the Paris Agreement on climate change.[122] In 2016, Kellogg Company urged President-elect Donald Trump to \"continue the Paris Climate Agreement\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Voter ID laws[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has donated to notable groups opposing voter-ID laws, such as the Applied Research Center (now RaceForward).[124] The company also decided to remove their advertisements from the Breitbart News website.[125] Breitbart News in turn called for a boycott of Kellogg's products.[126]\n\n\n\n### Education grant[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Kellogg's gave the Calhoun School a $250,000 grant for a \"three-part youth-based project on issues of white privilege and institutionalized racism\".[127]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Trafford Park factory in Greater Manchester, England\u2014Kellogg's European base since 1938.[4] The factory produces more Corn Flakes than any other Kellogg's factory in the world.[128]\n* Australia:\n\t+ Pagewood[129]\n\t+ Charmhaven (snack and cereal plant closed in 2014.)[130]\n* Belgium: Zaventem & Mechelen plant\n* Brazil: S\u00e3o Paulo\n* Colombia: Bogot\u00e1\n* Canada:\n\t+ Mississauga, Ontario \u2013 Canadian head office\n\t+ Anjou, Quebec \u2013 Eastern Canada sales office\n\t+ Calgary, Alberta \u2013 Western Canada sales office\n\t+ London, Ontario \u2013 manufacturers and distributes cereals (including Corn Flakes) in Canada.

Founded on the banks of the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, the company originally gained fame for being a large flour miller. Today, the company markets many well-known North American brands, including Gold Medal flour, Annie's Homegrown, L\u00e4rabar, Cascadian Farm, Betty Crocker, Yoplait, Nature Valley, Totino's, Pillsbury, Old El Paso, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, as well as breakfast cereals under the General Mills name, including Cheerios, Chex, Lucky Charms, Trix, Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula and the other monster cereals.[3]\n\n\nIt is headquartered in Golden Valley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement, late 1880s\n### Washburn-Crosby Company[edit]\n\n\nThe company can trace its history to the **Minneapolis Milling Company**, incorporated in 1856.[4] The company was founded by Illinois Congressman Robert Smith, who leased power rights to flour mills operating along the west side of Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Cadwallader C. Washburn acquired the company shortly after its founding and hired his brother William D. Washburn to assist in the company's development. In 1866 the Washburns got into the business themselves, building the Washburn \"B\" Mill at the falls. At the time, the building was considered to be so large and output so vast that it could not possibly sustain itself. However, the company succeeded, and in 1874 he built the even bigger Washburn \"A\" Mill.\n\n\nIn 1877, the mill entered a partnership with John Crosby to form the **Washburn-Crosby Company**, producing winter wheat Flour. That same year Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open the market for spring wheat.[5] Dunwoody was successful and became a silent partner.\n\n\nIn 1878, the \"A\" mill was destroyed in a flour dust explosion along with five nearby buildings, an event known as the Great Mill Disaster. The ensuing fire led to the death of 18 workers.[6] Construction of a new mill began immediately. Not only was the new mill safer but it also was able to produce a higher quality flour after the old grinding stones were replaced with automatic steel rollers, the first ever used.\n\n\nIn 1880, Washburn-Crosby flour brands won gold, silver and bronze medals at the Millers' International Exhibition in Cincinnati, causing them to launch the Gold Medal flour brand.[7]\n\n\nIn 1924, the company acquired a failing Twin Cities radio station, WLAG, renaming it WCCO (from Washburn-Crosby Company).\n\n\n\n### Founding as General Mills[edit]\n\n\n**General Mills** itself was created on June 20, 1928,[8] when Washburn-Crosby President James Ford Bell merged Washburn-Crosby with three other mills.[9] In the same year, General Mills acquired the Wichita Mill and Elevator Company of the industrialist Frank Kell of Wichita Falls, Texas. With the sale, Kell acquired cash plus stock in the corporation.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Postcard image of the Gold Medal Flour factory in Minneapolis c. 1900\nShares of the new company's stock were first sold on the New York Stock Exchange on November 30, 1928, at $65 per share. The newly merged company paid a dividend in 1928 and has continued the dividend uninterrupted ever since \u2013 one of only a few companies to pay a dividend every year since its founding.[8]\n\n\n\n### Engineering milestones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Mills's corporate campus in Golden Valley, Minnesota\nIn the 1930s, General Mills engineer, Thomas R. James, created the puffing gun, which inflated or distorted cereal pieces into puffed-up shapes. This new technology was used in 1937 to create Kix cereal and in 1941 to create Cheerioats (known today as Cheerios).\nIn 1939, General Mills engineer Helmer Anderson created the Anderson sealer. This new device allowed for bags of flour to be sealed with glue instead of just being tied with a string.\nIn 1956, General Mills created the tear-strip for easily opening packages.\n\n\n\n### Aeronautical Research Division and Electronics Division[edit]\n\n\nIn 1946, General Mills established their Aeronautical Research Division with chief engineer Otto C. Winzen. This division developed high altitude balloons in conjunction with the United States Navy Office of Naval Research (ONR), such as the Skyhook balloon.[11]\n\n\nIn 1956, hundreds of General Mills balloons carrying reconnaissance equipment were launched by the United States government under Project Genetrix to surveil Eastern bloc countries, in particular their nuclear capabilities.[12][13]\n\n\nThe aeronautical work of General Mills done around the time of the Second World War was continued by Raven Industries.[14]\n\n\nThe General Mills Electronics division developed the DSV *Alvin* submersible, which is notable for being used in investigating the wreck of *Titanic* among other deep-sea exploration missions.[15]\n\n\n\n### Merchandising and television[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1929, General Mills products contained box top coupons, known as Betty Crocker coupons, with varying point values, which were redeemable for discounts on a variety of housewares products featured in the widely distributed Betty Crocker catalog. The coupons and the catalog were discontinued by the company in 2006.\n\n\nGeneral Mills became the sponsor of the popular radio show *The Lone Ranger* in 1941. The show was then brought to television, and, after 20 years, their sponsorship came to an end in 1961.\n\n\n\n![](image)Former site of General Mills today on the Mississippi River at Minneapolis\nBeginning in 1959, General Mills sponsored the *Rocky and His Friends* television series, later known as *The Bullwinkle Show*. Until 1968, Rocky and Bullwinkle were featured in a variety of advertisements for General Mills. General Mills was also a sponsor of the Saturday-morning cartoons from the Total Television productions studio, including Tennessee Tuxedo.[16] The company also was a sponsor of the ABC western series *The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp*, starring Hugh O'Brian. The company, along with its subsidiary The Program Exchange, backed DiC Entertainment in syndicating the *Dennis the Menace* animated series based on the comic strip of the same name created by Hank Ketcham in 1986. From 1997 until May 31, 2004, General Mills sponsored and syndicated the first 82 episodes of the original *Sailor Moon* English dub (the remaining 17 of 82 episodes premiered on Cartoon Network's programming block Toonami in 1998).\n\n\n\n### Diversification: toys and restaurants[edit]\n\n\nThe first venture General Mills took into the toy industry was in 1965. The company bought Rainbow Crafts, which was the manufacturer of Play-Doh. General Mills's purchase of the company was significant because it brought production costs down and tripled the revenue.\n\n\nIn 1967, General Mills bought the Kenner toy company.\n\n\nGeneral Mills came out with their \"monster cereals\" in the 1970s. The cereals are now produced and sold seasonally around Halloween.[17]\n\n\nIn 1970, General Mills acquired a five-unit restaurant company called Red Lobster and expanded it nationwide. Soon, a division of General Mills titled General Mills Restaurants developed to take charge of the Red Lobster chain. In 1980, General Mills acquired the California-based Good Earth health food restaurant chain.[18] The company eventually converted the restaurants into other chain restaurants they were operating, such as Red Lobster.[19][20] In 1982, General Mills Restaurants founded a new Italian-themed restaurant chain called Olive Garden. Another themed restaurant, China Coast, was added before the entire group was spun off to General Mills shareholders in 1995 as Darden Restaurants.\n\n\nDuring the same decade, General Mills ventured further, starting the General Mills Specialty Retail Group. They acquired two clothing and apparel companies, Talbots and Eddie Bauer. The acquisition was short-lived. Talbots was purchased by a Japanese company, then known as JUSCO, and the Spiegel company purchased Bauer. Spiegel later declared bankruptcy, yet Bauer still remains, albeit in a smaller presence in the United States today.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Washburn \"A\" Mill, the producer of Gold Medal Flour, now the Minnesota Historical Society Mill City Museum\nFrom 1976 to 1985, General Mills went to court as the parent company of Parker Brothers, which held the rights on the brand name and gaming idea of the board game *Monopoly*, claiming that the so-called Anti-Monopoly game of an economics professor infringed their trademark. The dispute extended up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against them, saying that while they have exclusive rights to the game *Monopoly*, they cannot prevent others from using the word \"monopoly\" in the name of a game.\n\n\nIn 1985, General Mills's toy division was separated from its parent as Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. There were many potential acquirers of the business but it was floated on the stock exchange with General Mills's shareholders getting equivalent shares in Kenner Parker. This was more tax efficient for General Mills.[21]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1990, a joint venture with Nestl\u00e9 S.A. called Cereal Partners was formed[22] which markets cereals (including many existing General Mills cereal brands) outside the US and Canada under the Nestl\u00e9 name.\n\n\nIn 2001, the company purchased Pillsbury (sans Burger King) from Diageo, although it was officially described as a \"merger\".\n\n\nSince 2004, General Mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers. The company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain. The company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar.[23][24] General Mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving.[25]\n\n\nIn April 2011, General Mills announced that it will switch all 1 million eggs it uses each year to cage-free.[26]\n\n\nGeneral Mills was ranked #181 on the 2012 Fortune 500 list of America's largest corporations,[27] 161 in 2015 and was the third-largest food consumer products company in the United States.[28] During June 2012, the company's vice-president for diversity stated that General Mills opposes a Minnesota amendment banning gay marriage, stating that the company values \"inclusion\".[29] The company received positive feedback for its stand which might attract people to its global workforce.[30]\n\n\nThe company announced in September 2014 that it would acquire organic food producer Annie's Inc. for a fee of around $820 million, as part of its strategy to expand in the US natural foods market.[31] In October 2014, General Mills announced plans to cut 700 to 800 jobs, mostly in U.S., in corporate restructuring planned to be completed by the end of 2015.[32]\n\n\nIn 2015, citing climate change, General Mills promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent over 10 years.[33][34] In December 2016, the company announced it would be restructuring, splitting into four business groups based on global region, and cutting as many as 600 jobs.[35]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the company entered into the pet products industry, paying $8 billion to buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.[36] As of 2018, the company ranked 182nd on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[37]\n\n\nHaving launched its first regenerative agriculture pilot program in March 2019, the company has plans to improve soil health on 1 million acres of farmland by 2030 and has formed a partnership with Regrow Agriculture, a software and data analysis company that uses satellite imagery, weather data, and soil data to measure carbon sequestration in soil.[38][39]\n\n\nIn February 2020, General Mills was recognized by CDP as a global leader in corporate sustainability and received a place on the CDP \"A List\" for both climate change and water security.[40]\n\n\nOn May 15, 2021, General Mills announced that it was acquiring Tyson Foods's pet treat business, including True Chews, Nudges and Top Chews, for $1.2 billion.[41] The acquisition was completed on July 7, 2021.[42]\n\n\nIn April 2022, there were increasing news reports and complaints that the company's Lucky Charms cereal was somehow making individuals ill, with the most common complaints being gastrointestinal in nature, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The episodes have not yet resulted in a company- or FDA-initiated recall; an FDA spokesperson said they were investigating approximately 100 reports. These reports came as norovirus was circulating in some areas of the U.S. It is relatively rare for cereals, as opposed to other foods, to be contaminated by microbes, because they must be baked, although it is possible if conditions are unsanitary.[43][44]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2022, General Mills announced that it was acquiring TNT Crust, a supplier of frozen pizza crusts, from Peak Rock Capital.[45]\n\n\nOn May 25, 2022, General Mills announced that it was selling its Hamburger Helper and Suddenly Salad businesses to Eagle Family Foods Group for $610 million. The sale was completed on July 5, 2022.[46]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2023, General Mills acquired a pet supplement business, Fera Pets, Inc.[47]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Change to legal terms[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2014, the company announced that it had changed its legal terms on its website to introduce an arbitration clause requiring all disputes with General Mills to be resolved in small claims court or arbitration and not as a participant in a class action.[48][49] The change was made shortly after a judge's March 26, 2014, denial of a motion to dismiss a class action regarding the marketing of the company's Nature Valley brand products.[49] Users would be deemed to accept the terms by interacting with General Mills on its website in various ways, such as downloading coupons, subscribing to newsletters, or participating in Internet forums hosted on the website.[50][51] *The New York Times* stated that the agreement could be interpreted to additionally construe purchasing General Mills products at a grocery store or liking the company's Facebook page as assent to the terms;[48] General Mills disclaimed that interpretation, calling it a \"mischaracterization\".[51][52][53] The change in terms resulted in a massive backlash of protests via consumer groups and social media, and General Mills reverted the terms back to the original content after only a few days.[54]\n\n\n\n### Involvement in Israeli settlements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of companies operating in West Bank settlements\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights.[55] General Mills was listed on the database on account of the activities of its subsidiary General Mills Israel in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories,[56] which some have argued is illegal under international law.[57]\n\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Breakfast cereals[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Mills's breakfast cereals include:\n\n\n\n* Basic 4\n* Boo-Berry\n* Cascadian Farm\n* Cheerios and its variants\n* Chex and its variants\n* Cinnamon Toast Crunch\n* Cocoa Puffs\n* Cookie Crisp\n* Count Chocula\n* Fiber One / Fibre One\n* Franken-Berry\n* French Toast Crunch[58]\n* Gold Flakes\n* Golden Grahams\n* Honey Nut Clusters\n* Kix\n* Lucky Charms\n* Morning Summit[59]\n* Nesquik\n* Oatmeal Crisp\n* Raisin Nut Bran\n* Reese's Puffs\n* Total\n* Trix\n* Wheaties\n\nSome brands are marketed outside the US and Canada by the Cereal Partners joint venture using the Nestl\u00e9 brand.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Mills cereals no longer manufactured include:\n\n\n\n* Banana Wackies / Wackies (introduced 1965; discontinued 1968)[60]\n* Baron von Redberry and Sir Grapefellow (introduced 1972, discontinued 1975)[61]\n* Benefit (which contained psyllium, an Indian-grown grain used as a laxative and cholesterol-reducer)[62]\n* Body Buddies (introduced 1979; two flavors, Brown Sugar & Honey and Natural Fruit Flavor)[63]\n* Buc Wheats[63]\n* Bu\u00f1uelitos (\"Sweetened corn puffs with cinnamon and a touch of honey...

W. Post, owns a large portfolio of cereal brands that include Bran Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Golden Crisp, Grape-Nuts, Honeycomb, Oreo O's, Pebbles, and Waffle Crisp, among others. The company also produces several pet food brands, including Rachael Ray Nutrish, Kibbles 'n Bits, and 9Lives, and markets Peter Pan Peanut Butter.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)C.W. Post, founder\nC. W. Post established his company in Battle Creek, Michigan, having lived there since 1891, when he was a patient at a holistic sanitarium operated by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.[1][2] Dr. Kellogg, with his brother W. K. Kellogg, had developed a dry corn flake cereal that was part of their patients\u2019 diet. Post's first product, introduced in 1895, was not a cereal, however, but a roasted, cereal-based beverage, Postum. Having developed an aversion to coffee during his time in the sanitarium, Post positioned Postum as a healthy alternative. Its advertising slogan, which he coined himself, was, \"There's a Reason.\" Postum's main ingredients were naturally caffeine-free wheat grain, bran, and molasses. Initially, Postum had to be brewed like coffee, but in 1911, Post introduced a powdered, instant formulation. This version of the product was manufactured in Battle Creek until it was discontinued in 2007. As of January 2013, Eliza's Quest Food had succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.\n\n\nIn 1897, Post introduced his first dry cereal, a crunchy blend of wheat and barley, which he called Grape Nuts. His first corn-flake product was introduced as \"Elijah's Manna\" in 1904. Owing to consumer resistance to the (inaccurate) biblical reference[3] that was so great that even Great Britain flatly refused to register the name as a trademark, it was renamed Post Toasties in 1907.[4]\n\n\nC. W. Post was an astute businessman who believed that advertising and aggressive marketing were the keys to a successful enterprise. Within 10 years of its incorporation, his Postum Cereal Company had more than $10 million in capital and was spending $400,000 a year on advertising, sums which were remarkable for the period.[5] Although he vigorously opposed labor unions, his employees were the highest-paid in his industry and working conditions at the Post factory were exemplary. He even developed a factory town in which he sold homes to his workers at favorable rates.\n\n\nPostum Cereal Company lost its founder in 1914. C.W. Post underwent an apparently successful appendectomy at the Mayo Clinic, but shortly after returning home to recuperate, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Post had for years suffered from bouts of illness and depression. While his death was without warning, his company was not left rudderless. His daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, had been raised in the business and was familiar with virtually every aspect of its operations.[6] She assumed control of the now $20-million Postum Company and managed its affairs for the next eight years. While she did not oversee major product innovations, she did have a good feel for business and for promoting talented managers. In addition, her second marriage, in 1920, was to Edward F. Hutton, the founder of a brokerage firm on Wall Street.\n\n\nGross revenues in 1921 were $17.75 million.[7] In 1922, Hutton took the newly incorporated Postum Cereal Company public by issuing 200,000 common shares. The 1920s was a period in which common stock was still considered highly speculative, and consequently the newly issued shares carried a dividend at the rate of $5.00 per year.\n\n\nRevenues in 1922 were essentially the same as in 1921, but in 1923, they were $22.25 million and a stock split, in the form of a 100% stock dividend, increased the authorized shares to 400,000. These shares also earned a $3.00 annual cash dividend, representing a 20% increase over the presplit rate. In 1925, with revenues now at $27.4 million, the stock was split once again and the dividend was increased to $4.00 per new share.\n\n\n\n### Major acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative placque at the Postum Cereal Company Factory, September 2014\nStarting in 1925, under the leadership of financier (and at one point, son in-law to the founder), E. F. Hutton as chairman and Colby M. Chester as president, Postum Cereal made the first of a series of corporate acquisitions which would within a few years transform it into the dominant U.S. packaged grocery products manufacturer.\n\n\nIt began late that year with the purchase of the Jell-O Company. Jell-O had been first produced in 1897 by Pearle Bixby Wait, a carpenter from the town of LeRoy in northern New York state. Mr. Wait's product was based upon a patent that had been issued to inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper in 1845, but which Cooper had never developed commercially. However, Wait was unsuccessful in marketing Jell-O, and in 1899, he sold the rights to it for $450 to a neighbor, Orator Francis Woodward, who had founded the Genesee Pure Food Company in 1897. Genesee became the Jell-O Company in 1923, the same year it began marketing D-Zerta, a sugar-free gelatin, and a powdered mixture for making ice cream in the kitchen.\n\n\nIn 1926, Postum Cereal acquired Igleheart Brothers, Inc (established in 1856), the makers of Swans Down cake flour, and followed this with the purchase of the Minute Tapioca Company. \"Tapioca Superlative\" had been invented in 1894 by a Boston woman, Susan Stavers, who made it from tapioca flakes that she ran through her coffee grinder. Later that year, she sold the rights to John Whitman, of Orange, Massachusetts, who changed its name to \"Minute Tapioca\". In 1908, he changed the name of his company to that of his product. The \"Minute\" brand would later become better known for a General Foods innovation introduced in 1949 known as Minute Rice, a brand of parboiled rice.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the Jell-O and Minute Tapioca acquisitions, Postum Cereal's revenues in 1926 jumped to $46.9 million. The number of shares stood at 1.375 million, including shares issued to acquire Jell-O and Minute Tapioca. The dividend was increased to $4.70 a year.\n\n\nThe acquisition spree continued in 1927 with the purchase of two similarly named confectionery companies, chocolate-maker Walter Baker (founded in 1765, making it the oldest component of the Postum constituent companies), and coconut-processor Franklin Baker, which had begun early in the 19th century as a flour broker, but whose confectionery products dated from 1895. This was followed by the purchase of Log Cabin Products, the maker of Log Cabin Syrup (first produced in 1887), and of Richard Hellmann, Inc (established in 1913), the producer of Blue Ribbon mayonnaise. And late in the year, Postum Cereal began selling its first coffee product, \"Sanka\", by obtaining US marketing rights from Dr Ludwig Roselius of Bremen, Germany. Roselius had developed the decaffeinated coffee in 1906 and began selling it in the US in 1923.[8]\n\n\nThree more acquisitions followed in 1928. The most important was that of the Cheek-Neel Coffee Company. Its product, Maxwell House, dating from 1892, was a well-known brand in what was still a fragmented US coffee market. Within a few years, however, it was to become the number one brand in America and would retain that position well into the 1980s. Also acquired during 1928 was the La France Manufacturing Company, a maker of starch and other laundry products (this being Postum's first venture into nonedibles), and the Calumet Baking Powder Company, the leading maker of this kitchen essential.\n\n\nFinancially, the year culminated on October 1 with the inclusion of Postum, Inc in the newly reformulated Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 common stocks.[9] By year-end, revenues stood at $101 million and the dividend on the five million authorized shares was $5.00 per year, a 25-fold increase since 1922.\n\n\n\n### Purchase of General Foods and renaming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Foods 1937 Specimen Stock Certificate\nBy far the most important acquisition of 1929 was of the frozen-food company owned by Clarence Birdseye,[10] called \"General Foods Company\". Birdseye (December 9, 1886 - October 7, 1956) was one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of the food industry. Born in New York City, he became interested in the frozen preservation of food during the course of working as a fur trader in Labrador between 1912 and 1916. By 1923, he had developed a commercially viable process for quick-freezing foods using a belt mechanism, which he patented. In 1924, with backing from three investors, he formed the General Seafoods Company, in Gloucester, Massachusetts, to produce frozen haddock fillets packed in plain cardboard boxes.\n\n\nThe founder's daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, was first to become excited about the prospects for the frozen foods business. In 1926, she had put into port at Gloucester on her yacht, *Hussar (IV)*, and was served a luncheon meal which, she learned to her amazement, had been frozen six months before. Despite her enthusiasm, it took Post three years to convince Postum's management to acquire the company. Postum paid $10.75 million for a 51% interest and its partner, Goldman Sachs, paid $12.5 million for the other 49%.[11] Following this acquisition, Postum, Inc changed its name to General Foods Corporation. Goldman sold its share back to General Foods in 1932, apparently at a slight loss.\n\n\nShortly after the acquisition, General Foods began test-marketing an expanded line of frozen foods, but the company quickly realized that a packaging process alone would not be sufficient to market frozen products in stores. To be sold, the packages had to be kept frozen while on display, so Birdseye engineers began development of a freezer cabinet designed specifically to hold frozen foods. The cabinet, which first appeared in 1934, required a great deal of space and electricity, which were not readily available in most grocery stores of the period. For those stores which could accommodate them, the payback was immediate. Housewives quickly realized that keeping packages of frozen food in the icebox could mean fresher meals and fewer trips to the market.[12]\n\n\nThe company published a cook book in 1932, the *General Foods Cook Book*, dedicated \"To the American homemaker\". Five editions were published between 1932 and 1937. The book includes photographs (among which is \"General Foods offers over twenty famous products for your well-stocked pantry shelf\") and a subject index.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## After General Foods[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Ralcorp announced plans to spin off Post Foods into a separate company. About a quarter of Ralcorp's sales in 2010 were generated by its Post Foods unit.[14] The spinoff was completed with an IPO for Post Holdings, Inc. on February 7, 2012.[15]\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired Michael Foods.[16] The following year, Post Foods purchased MOM Brands (formerly Malt-O-Meal Co.) creating the third largest breakfast cereal company in the US. At this point, Post Foods rebranded as Post Consumer Brands, and is headquartered in Lakeville, Minnesota.\n\n\nIn July 2017, Post Holdings bought Weetabix Limited for \u00a31.4\u00a0billion.[17] In 2019, the company began combining some of its MOM Brands and Weetabix cereal brands under the Three Sisters Cereal name.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Post Holdings announced that it was acquiring the Peter Pan peanut butter brand from Conagra Brands.[18] The transaction was completed on January 25, 2021.[19] With the acquisition of Peter Pan peanut butter on January 25, 2021, Post created a new group called Animated Brands,[20] with the Peter Pan brand being the founding member. Animated Brands is managed under Post Consumer Brands.\n\n\nOn June 1, 2021, Post announced it acquired the ready-to-eat (\"RTE\") cereal business of TreeHouse Foods.[21] The TreeHouse Foods RTE cereal business was added to Post Consumer Brands' broad portfolio of private label cereal products.\n\n\nIn February 2023, Post Holdings announced its acquisition of pet food brands like 9Lives, Kibbles \u2018n Bits and Gravy Train. Such acquisition would enable Post's entry to the 'pet food category'. After the completion of this acquisition, Post intends to develop a new pet food category within Post Consumer Brands. [22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### Postum advertisements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Postum\n\nPostum, a coffee substitute made out of roasted grain, was created in 1895. It was popular through the early 20th century, particularly during World War II when coffee was rationed.\n\n\n\nDue to its decline in popularity, Post announced its discontinuation in 2007.[25][26][27] It was later revived by Eliza's Quest Food in 2013.[28]\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## Post Consumer Brands brands \u2013 present cereals and products[edit]\n\n\n* 100% Bran \u2013 currently only available in Canada\n* Airly Foods - Butter\n* Airly Foods - Cheddar\n* Airly Foods - Chocolate\n* Airly Foods - Cinnamon\n* Airly Foods - Salted Caramel\n* Airly Foods - Sea Salt\n* Bran Flakes\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Maple & Brown Sugar[29]\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Cinnamon Roll\n* Better Oats - Classic Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Classic Strawberries & Cream\n* Better Oats - Organic Maple and Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Organic Bare\n* Better Oats - Organic Old Fashioned Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Steel Cut Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Quick Oats\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar with Protein\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Original\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Blueberry Muffin\n* Chips Ahoy!\n* CoCo Wheats\n* Farina (food) Mills hot wheat cereal\n* Cocoa Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles\n* Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles Treats\n* Fruity Pebbles Crisps[30]\n* Cocoa Pebbles Crisps\n* Golden Crisp\n* Grape-Nuts\n* Grape-Nuts Flakes\n* Great Grains Banana Nut Crunch\n* Great Grains Blueberry Morning\n* Great Grains Cranberry Almond Crunch\n* Great Grains Crunchy Pecans\n* Great Grains Raisins, Dates & Pecans\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 with Almonds\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 with Real Strawberries\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Pecan & Maple Brown Sugar\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Frosted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Whole Grain Honey Crunch\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Granola \u2013 Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Granola \u2013 French Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats \u2013 Granola \u2013 Maple Pecan\n* Honey Maid S'mores\n* Honeycomb\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Original[31]\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Chocolate\n* Oh's\n* Oreo O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Maple & Brown Sugar Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Original Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Apple Zings\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolately Chip Cookie Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Churr-O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cinnamon Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Coco Roos\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cookies & Cream\n* Malt-O-Meal - Crispy Rice\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Flakes\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Blasts\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Honey O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Puffs\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Buzzers\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Graham Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Nut Scooters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Almonds\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Honey\n* Malt-O-Meal - Peanut Butter Cups\n* Malt-O-Meal - Raisin Bran\n* Malt-O-Meal - S'mores\n* Malt-O-Meal - Strawberry Cream Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities with Marshmallows\n* Post Dunkin' cereal - Caramel Macchiato\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Chocolate Almond\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Mixed Berry Almond\n* Raisin Bran\n* Shredded Wheat (made by Nestl\u00e9 and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Original Spoon Size\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Original Big Biscuit\n* Shredded Wheat \u2013 Wheat'N Bran Spoon Size\n* Shreddies \u2013 currently only available in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany (made by Nestl\u00e9 and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Waffle Crisp\n\n## Post Consumer Brands discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\n* 40% Bran Flakes\n* Alpha-Bits\n* Beep Beep (with the Wile E.

Kellogg's Corn Flakes eventually overtook Post Toasties in popularity and the latter brand is today only a minor player in the dry-cereal market.\n5. **^** See *International Directory of Company Histories*, Volume 2, pp 530-32, published by St. James Press, 1990, for details relating to the company during this period.\n6. **^** Biographical details of Post's life may be found in *American National Biography*, Volume 7, p. 732.\n7. **^** Financial details for the company during this period may be found in the annual issues of \u2019\u2019Moody\u2019s Manual of Investments American and Foreign Industrial Securities\u2019\u2019, published by Moody\u2019s Investor Services.\n8. **^** \"Sanka\" is a contraction of the French words, *sans caf\u00e9ine*.

Ultimately, Roselius settled on a washing process under more sanitary conditions. General Foods purchased Roselius's American company outright in 1932 and the original German company, Sanka HAG, AG, in 1979.\n9. **^** \"djindexes.com\" (PDF).

As Quaker Mill Company, the company was founded in 1877 in Ravenna, Ohio. In 1881, Henry Crowell bought the company and launched a national advertising campaign for Quaker Oats.\n\n\nIn 1911, the company acquired the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package was introduced in 1915. Although Quaker Oats Company claims that the \"Quaker man\" is not meant to resemble or represent an actual person, the company identified the Quaker man as William Penn in advertising dating back to 1909. \n\n\nIn 1983, Quaker acquired Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., the maker of Van Camp's and Gatorade. In 2001, PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats for $14 billion, primarily to acquire the Gatorade brand.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Precursor miller companies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1905 magazine advertisement.\nIn the 1850s, Ferdinand Schumacher and Robert Stuart founded oat mills. Schumacher founded the German Mills American Oatmeal Company in Akron, Ohio, and Stuart founded the North Star Mills in Hearst, Ontario, Rupert's Land. In 1870, Schumacher ran his first known cereal advertisement in the Akron Beacon Journal newspaper. In 1877, the Quaker Mill Company of Ravenna, Ohio, was founded. \n\n\nAccording to some accounts, Quaker Mill partner Henry Seymour came up with the brand name after discovering an encyclopedia article about Quakers. He stated that the qualities describing Quakers, such as integrity, honesty, and purity, were traits that he wanted customers to associate with the company's product. According to the company, William Heston also claimed to have selected the name.[2] Quaker Mill Company held the trademark on the Quaker name. In Ravenna, Ohio, on September 4, 1877, Henry Seymour of the Quaker Mill Company applied for the first trademark for a breakfast cereal[3]\u2014\"a figure of a man in 'Quaker garb'\".[4][2]\n\n\nIn 1879, John Stuart and his son Robert joined with George Douglas to form Imperial Mill and set up their operation in Chicago, Illinois. In 1881, Henry Parsons Crowell bought the Quaker Mill Company;[2] the following year, he launched the first national magazine advertising campaign for breakfast cereal, introducing a cereal box that made it possible to buy in quantities other than bulk. He also bought the bankrupt Quaker Oat Mill Company in Ravenna and held the key positions of general manager, president and chairman of the company from 1888 until late 1943, becoming known as the cereal tycoon. He donated more than 70% of his wealth to the Crowell Trust.\n\n\nIn 1888, the American Cereal Company was formed by the merger of seven major oat millers. Ferdinand Schumacher became president, Henry Crowell the general manager, and John Stuart the secretary-treasurer. In 1889, the American Cereal Company introduced the half-ounce trial size and, as a promotion, distributed one to every home in Portland, Oregon, via boys on bicycles. Later, this promotion was extended to other cities. A second promotion involved placing dinner plates within the then-regular (not round) boxes of oats.\n\n\n\n### Quaker Oats Company[edit]\n\n\nIn 1901, the Quaker Oats Company was founded in New Jersey with headquarters in Chicago, by the merger of four oat mills: the Quaker Mill Company in Ravenna, Ohio, which held the trademark on the Quaker name; the cereal mill in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, owned by John Stuart, his son Robert Stuart, and their partner George Douglas; the German Mills American Oatmeal Company in Akron, Ohio, owned by Schumacher; The Rob Lewis & Co. American Oats and Barley Oatmeal Corporation. Formally known as \"Good For Breakfast\" instant oatmeal mix. In the same year, the whole merged company was acquired by Crowell, who also bought the bankrupt Quaker Oat Mill Company, also in Ravenna.[5]\n\n\nIn 1908, Quaker Oats introduced the first in a series of cookie recipes on the box. In 1911, Quaker Oats purchased the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package made its first appearance in 1915. Later that year, Quaker offered the first cereal box premium to buyers. By sending in one dollar and the cutout picture of the \"Quaker Man\" customers received a double boiler for the cooking of oatmeal. \n\n\nIn the 1920s, Quaker introduced \"Quaker Quick Oats\", an early convenience food, and also offered a crystal radio set built in the same cylindrical canister as Quick Oats, with the same label, for US$1 plus two trademarks cut from Quaker Oats packages.[6] In the 1930s, Quaker was one of the many companies using the Dionne Quintuplets for promotional purposes.[7] Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)The company's contribution to the US war effort.\nDuring World War II, the company, through its subsidiary the Q. O. Ordnance Company, operated the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant (six miles west of Grand Island) as a government-owned, contractor-operated 11,960-acre site.[9] Construction began in March 1942 and production ended in August 1945.[10] It manufactured millions of pieces of various artillery munitions (41 warehouses and 219 magazines of a total of 280,800\u00a0ft\u00b2 were built).[11]\n\n\nIn 1946, artist Jim Nash was commissioned to produce a head portrait of the Quaker Man, which became the basis for Haddon Sundblom's famous version of 1957. In 1972, John Mills designed the current logo.\n\n\nIn 1968, a plant was built in Danville, Illinois, which now makes Pearl Milling Company pancake mixes, Oat Squares, Life Cereals Quaker Oh's, Bumpers, Quisp, King Vitamin Natural Granola Cereals, and Chewy granola bars, as well as Puffed Rice for use as an ingredient for other products in other plants.\n\n\nIn 1969, Quaker acquired Fisher-Price, a toy company. In 1991, Quaker Oats spun off its Fisher-Price division.\n\n\nIn 1971, the company financed the making of the film *Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory*, based on the famous children\u2019s novel by Roald Dahl. In return the company obtained a license to use a number of the product names mentioned in the film for candy bars. The film was considered a box office disappointment at the time of release, and the film\u2019s original distributor Paramount eventually sold the rights back to Quaker Oats, who then sold the rights to Warner Bros. because the company had no involvement in the film business. The film became extremely popular in the 1980s via repeated television airings and home video sales.[12]\n\n\nIn 1972, Quaker Oats purchased Louis Marx and Company, a company that created one quarter of all toys and trains manufactured in the mid-1950s. It sold the business after four years.[13]\n\n\nIn 1982, Quaker Oats purchased US Games, a company that created games for the Atari 2600. It went out of business after one year. That same year, Quaker Oats acquired Florida-based orange juice plant Ardmore Farms, which it would own until selling it to Country Pure Foods in 1998.[14][15]\n\n\nIn 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of Van Camp's and Gatorade.[16]\n\n\nQuaker bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million.[17] Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000.[18] It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners, Dr Pepper Snapple Group.\n\n\nIn 1996, Quaker spun off its frozen food business, selling it to Aurora Foods (which was bought by Pinnacle Foods in 2004).\n\n\nIn August 2001, Quaker Oats was acquired by PepsiCo for $14 billion,[19] primarily for the Gatorade brand.\n\n\nStarting in 1987, actor Wilford Brimley appeared in television commercials for Quaker. In the commercials, he extolled the virtues and healthfulness of oat consumption, sometimes to a young child. \"It's the right thing to do\" was a common slogan during the commercials.[20]\n\n\n\n### Major facility[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Quaker Oats facility in Peterborough, Ontario.\nThe major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in Peterborough, Ontario. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company[21] in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as \"The Electric City\" due to its hydropower resources,[22] attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The Trent\u2013Severn Waterway also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. On December 11, 1916, the factory all but completely burned to the ground. When the smoke had settled, 23 people had died and Quaker was left with $2,000,000 in damages. Quaker went on to rebuild the facility, incorporating the few areas of the structure that were not destroyed by fire.\n\n\nWhen PepsiCo purchased Quaker Oats in 2001, many brands were consolidated from facilities around Canada to the Peterborough location, which assumed the new QTG (Quaker Tropicana Gatorade) moniker. Local production includes Quaker Oatmeal, Quaker Chewy bars, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Pearl Milling Company instant pancake mixes and pancake syrups, Quaker Oat Bran and Corn Bran cereals, Gatorade sports drinks, the Propel fitness water sub-brand, Tropicana juices, and various Frito-Lay snack products. Products are easily identified by the *manufacturer by* address on the packaging. The Peterborough facility supplies the majority of Canada and exports limited portions to the United States. The Quaker plant sells cereal production byproducts to companies that use them to create fire logs and pellets.\n\n\nUntil 2022, Quaker Oats had a major R&D facility located in Barrington, Illinois. After numerous acquisitions the site was renamed, but retained its research and development focus.[23]\n\n\n\n### Land giveaways in cereal boxes[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 1902, the company's oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford, Connecticut. The lots, sometimes as small as 10 feet by 10 feet, were carved out of a 15-acre, never-built subdivision called Liberty Park. A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, redeemed their coupons for the free deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the \"oatmeal lots\". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several tracts would need to be combined before building could start. The legal deeds created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from them. In the mid-1970s, the town put an end to the oatmeal lots with a \"general foreclosure\" condemning nearly all of the property, which is now part of a BiC Corporation plant.[24]\n\n\nIn 1955, Quaker Oats again gave away land as part of a promotion, this one tied to the *Sergeant Preston of the Yukon* television show in the United States. The company offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike.[24]\n\n\n\n## Logo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Quaker Oats standing \"Quaker Man\" logo c.1900.\nStarting in 1877, the Quaker Oats logo had a figure of a Quaker man depicted full-length, sometimes holding a scroll with the word \"Pure\" written across it, resembling the classic woodcuts of William Penn (founder of the Province of Pennsylvania), the 17th-century philosopher and early Quaker.[25] Quaker Oats advertising dating back to 1909 did, indeed, identify the \"Quaker man\" as William Penn, and referred to him as \"standard bearer of the Quakers and of Quaker Oats\".[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Quaker Oats box, featuring the pre-2012 \"Quaker Man\" logo.\nIn 1946, graphic designer Jim Nash created a black-and-white head-and-shoulders portrait of the smiling Quaker Man, and Haddon Sundblom's now-familiar color head-and-shoulders portrait (using fellow Coca-Cola artist Harold W. McCauley as the model) debuted in 1957. The monochromatic 1969 Quaker Oats Company logo, modeled after the Sundblom illustration, was created by Saul Bass, a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and corporate logos. In 2012, the company enlisted the firm of Hornall Anderson to give the \"Quaker man\" a slimmer, somewhat younger look.[27][28] The man is now sometimes referred to as \"Larry\" by insiders at Quaker Oats.[29] And in 1965, a new advertising slogan was introduced: \"Nothing is better for thee, than me\".\n\n\nThe company states that its current \"Quaker man\" logo \"does not represent an actual person. His image is that of a man dressed in Quaker garb, including a Quaker hat, chosen because the Quaker faith projected the values of honesty, integrity, purity and strength\".[30]\n\n\nThe company has never had any ties with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). When the company was being built up, Quaker businessmen were known for their honesty (truth is often considered a Quaker testimony). The Quaker man was the first registered trademark for breakfast cereal in the United States; the character was registered on September 4, 1877.[31]\n\n\nMembers of the Religious Society of Friends have occasionally expressed frustration at being confused with the Quaker Oats representation.[32][33] Friends have twice protested the Quaker name being used for advertising campaigns seen as promoting violence. In 1990, some Quakers started a letter-writing campaign after a Quaker Oats advertisement depicted Popeye as a Quaker who used violence against aliens, sharks, and Bluto.[34] Later in that decade, more letters were sparked by Power Rangers toys included in Cap'n Crunch cereal.[35]\n\n\n\n## Informed consent controversy, research on children[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1946 to 1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of disabled children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a *Science Club* and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. They were not told that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron, and the consent form contained no information indicating this.[36][37] The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign.[38] The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997.[39]\n\n\n\n### Trans fat content and litigation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, two California consumers filed a class action lawsuit against the Quaker Oats Company. The plaintiffs alleged that Quaker marketed its products as healthy even though they contained unhealthy trans fat. Specifically, Quaker's Chewy Granola Bars, Instant Oatmeal, and Oatmeal to Go Bars contained trans fat,[40] yet their packaging featured claims like \"heart healthy\", \"wholesome\", and \"smart choices made easy\".[*citation needed*] The plaintiffs' complaint cited current scientific evidence that trans fat causes coronary heart disease[41] and is associated with a higher risk of diabetes[42] and some forms of cancer.[43] In 2014, Quaker agreed to remove trans fats from its products, at a cost of $1.4 million, although the company denied false or misleading labelling.[44]\n\n\n\n## US brands[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2005[update], these are the product brands marketed under the Quaker Oats name in the US:\n\n\n\n### Breakfast cereals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cap'n Crunch cereal.\n![](image)Life cereal.\nA 1981 TV commercial for the Quaker Corn Bran cereal.\n* Cap'n Crunch\n* Life cereal\n* Quisp\n* Mother's Natural Foods\n* Quaker 100% Natural Granola\n* Kretschmer Wheat Germ\n* Mr. T Cereal\n* Muffets (\"The round shredded wheat\")\n* Quaker Oatmeal Squares\n* Quaker Toasted Oatmeal\n* Quaker Oh's (sold to Post in 2014)\n* Quaker Corn Bran\n* Quaker Oat Bran\n* Quaker Grits\n* Quaker Oatmeal\n* Quaker Instant Oatmeal\n* Quaker Puffed Rice\n* Quaker Puffed Wheat\n* Quaker Oatmeal with Dinosaur Eggs\n* Graham Bumpers\n* Coco Bumpers\n* King Vitaman\n\n\n### Other breakfast foods[edit]\n\n\n* Quaker Oatmeal To Go (re-branded from Breakfast Squares in 2006)\n* Pearl Milling Company (re-branded from Aunt Jemima in 2021)\n* Quaker Breakfast Cookies\n\n\n### Snacks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chewy Granola Bar.\n* Quaker Crispy Minis (Rice Chips and Rice Cakes) (known as Snack-a-Jacks in the UK)\n* Quakes Rice Snacks\n* Quaker Soy Crisps\n* Quaker Snack Bars\n* Chewy Granola Bars\n* Quaker Mini Delights\n* Yogurt bars\n* Quaker Oatmeal Cookies\n* Greek Yogurt\n\n\n### Mixes[edit]\n\n\n* Quaker Tortilla Mix\n* Rice-A-Roni\n* Pasta Roni\n* Near East\n\n\n### Drinks[edit]\n\n\n* Milk Chillers\n* Tropicana fruit Juices\n* Sunbolt (defunct)\n\n\n## UK brands[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2008[update], these are the product brands marketed under the Quaker Oats name in the UK:[45]\n\n\n\n### Breakfast cereals[edit]\n\n\n* Sugar Puffs (sold in 2006 to Big Bear t/a Honey Monster Foods)[46]\n\n\n### Hot cereals[edit]\n\n\n* Quaker Oats\n* Oatso Simple (various flavours)\n* Quaker Oats Super Goodness Porridge\n* Quaker Oats Protein Porridge\n* Scott's Porage Oats\n* Scott's So Easy\n(the Scott's brand, previously a rival, is now also owned by Quaker)\n\n\n### Ready to eat cereal[edit]\n\n\n* Harvest Crunch\n* Quaker Wholesome Granola\n* Quaker Oat Granola\n* Quaker Oat Muesli\n* Quaker Oat Crisp\n\n\n### Cereal bars[edit]\n\n\n* Harvest Bar\n* Oat Bars (Original with golden syrup or Mixed berry flavors)\n\n\n### Snacks[edit]\n\n\n* New Quaker Fruit & Oat Squeeze\n* New Quaker Porridge to Go\n* Snack-a-Jacks\n\n\n## The Netherlands brands[edit]\n\n\nThese are the product brands marketed under the Quaker Oats name in the Netherlands:[47]\n\n\n\n### Hot cereals[edit]\n\n\n* Quaker Oats\n* Quaker Oats Express\n\n\n### Ready to eat cereal[edit]\n\n\n* Quaker Cruesli\n* Quaker Cruesli Zero Sugar\n* Quaker Cruesli Colours\n* Quaker Granola & Muesli\n\n\n### Cereal bars[edit]\n\n\n* Oat Bars (Original with golden syrup or chocolate flavors)\n\n\n## The Philippines brands[edit]\n\n\n* Quaker Instant Oatmeal\n* Quaker Oatmeal Cookies\n* Quaker Instant Oats Caldo\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Matthew Herper and Betsy Schiffman (2 August 2001). \"Pepsi Bought Quaker.
