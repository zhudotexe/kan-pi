R. R. Tolkien. The film is the first instalment in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.\n\n\nSet in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains part of his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their perilous journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. \n\n\nIt premiered on 10 December 2001 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was then released on 19 December in the United States and on 20 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It received praise for its visual effects, performances, Jackson's direction, screenplay, musical score, and faithfulness to the source material. It grossed over $880 million worldwide in its initial release, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2001 and the fifth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release.[5] Following subsequent reissues, it has as of 2021 grossed over $898 million.[4] Like its successors, *The Fellowship of the Ring* is widely recognized as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 74th Academy Awards, it was nominated for thirteen awards, including Best Picture, winning for Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects.\n\n\nIn 2007, the American Film Institute named it one of the 100 greatest American films in history, being both the most recent film and the only film released in the 21st century to make it to the list. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[6] Two sequels, *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*, followed in 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of his power, to dominate the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons Gollum and it is subsequently found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history.\n\n\nSixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and brutally tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman, but discovers his betrayal and alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazgûl servants to find Frodo.\n\n\nFrodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Nazgûl before arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf at the Inn of The Prancing Pony. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises to escort them to Rivendell; however, they are ambushed by the Nazgûl on Weathertop, and their leader, the Witch-King, stabs Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, an Elf and Strider's beloved, locates Strider and rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazgûl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by the Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other.\n\n\nLearning of Saruman's betrayal from Gandalf and now realizing that they are facing threats from both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, decides against keeping the Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider—who is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of *mithril*.\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman's spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin's Bane: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship reaches Lothlórien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship.\n\n\nThe Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring's magic and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cast of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n![](image)The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.[7] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly.[8] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[9] The film is noted for having an ensemble cast,[10] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n\n\n* Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: A young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999.[11] Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[12] Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[13] Jake Gyllenhaal unsuccessfully auditioned for the role.[14]\n* Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: An Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[12] while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.[15] Patrick McGoohan was also offered the role, but turned it down due to health issues.[16] Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer also turned down the role.[17][18] Richard Harris expressed interest in the part.[19] John Astin auditioned for Gandalf.[20] Sam Neill was also offered the role but declined due to his scheduling conflict with *Jurassic Park III*. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with *X-Men*.[13] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[9] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[7]\n* Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn: A Dúnedain ranger and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[21] Nicolas Cage also received an offer, declining because of \"family obligations\",[22] while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn.[*citation needed*] Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[12] Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down because he does not want to be typecast and believed it to be a similar role in *Gladiator*.[12] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[21] Executive producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[7] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[23] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[24] and carrying his \"hero\" sword around with him off-camera.[7]\n* Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee: Better known as Sam, a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[7] before Astin was cast, James Corden read for the part.[25]\n* Sean Bean as Boromir: A son of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[12]\n* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[12]\n* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, would later portray Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy.[12] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.[7] Rhys-Davies also played Gimli's father Glóin during the scene where the fellowship is forged.\n* Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[12]\n* Liv Tyler as Arwen: An elf of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in *Plunkett & Macleane*, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[12] Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[26]\n* Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: The elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Lucy Lawless was considered for the role.[27]\n* Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: The fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the *palantír*. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[23] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[12]\n* Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[13]\n* Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of *The Lord of the Rings*, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[12] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in *The Hobbit*, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[28]\n* Andy Serkis as Gollum (voice/motion-capture): A wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the Ring after bearing it for 500 years. This character appears briefly in the prologue. In Mordor, one can only hear his voice shouting and in Moria, only his eyes and his nose appear. Serkis was working on the 1999 six-episode *Oliver Twist* miniseries when his agent told him that Jackson wanted to approach him to play Gollum. Despite ultimately accepting the role, Serkis was initially doubtful about taking the part as one of his *Oliver Twist* fellow actors opined that it wasn't a good idea if his face wasn't going to appear onscreen, aside that Jackson was unsure if Gollum could be portrayed with motion-capture performance as they wished.[29]\n\n\nThe cast also includes:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Sala Baker as Sauron:[30] The Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master, who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form.\n* Marton Csokas as Celeborn the Wise: The Elven-Lord of Lothlórien and Galadriel's husband.\n* Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: The commander of Saruman's Uruk-Hai forces.\n* Craig Parker as Haldir: The leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien.\n* Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad: The last Elven-King of the Noldor.\n* Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: The last High King of Arnor and Gondor.\n* Harry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\n* Director Peter Jackson has a small cameo as a man with a carrot in Bree.\n\n\n## Comparison to the source material[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord of the Rings\n\nJackson, Walsh and Boyens made numerous changes to the story, for purposes of pacing and character development. Jackson said his main desire was to make a film focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the \"backbone\" of the story.[31] The prologue condenses Tolkien's backstory, in which The Last Alliance's seven-year siege of the Barad-dûr is a single battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his spirit flees.[32]\n\n\nSome events and characters from the book are condensed or omitted (such is the case of Tom Bombadil) at the beginning of the film. The time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years in the book, is compressed for timing reasons.[33] The filmmakers also decided to move the opening scenes of *The Two Towers*, the Uruk-hai ambush and Boromir's death, to the film's linear climax.[31][33]\n\n\nThe tone of the Moria sequence was altered. In the book, following the defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against the resistance of the rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting \"there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there,\" though no one seems to think this likely. Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria.[34] One detail that many critics commented upon is that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria (\"They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance\"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in (\"Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket. The noise is incredible.\").[35][36][37][38][39]\n\n\nWhen Frodo is struck by a Nazgûl at Weathertop, in the book, the elf Glorfindel rides him to Rivendell, whereas in the film, Arwen takes on this role.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Production of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDirector Peter Jackson began working with Christian Rivers to storyboard the series in August 1997, as well as getting Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth.[40] Jackson told them to make Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, and to think of it in a historical manner.[41]\n\n\nIn November,[41] Alan Lee and John Howe became the film trilogy's primary conceptual designers, having had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other tie-ins. Lee worked for the Art Department creating places such as Rivendell, Isengard, Moria, and Lothlórien, giving Art Nouveau and geometry influences to the Elves and Dwarves respectively.[41][42] Though Howe contributed with Bag End and the Argonath,[41][42] he focused on the design of the characters' armour, having studied it his entire life.[43] Weta and the Art Department continued to design, with Grant Major turning the Art Department's designs into architecture, and Dan Hennah scouting locations.[41] On 1 April 1999, Ngila Dickson joined the crew as costume designer. She and 40 seamstresses would create 19,000 costumes, 40 per version for the actor and their doubles, wearing them out for an impression of age.[24]\n\n\n\n### Filming locations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arwen faces the Nazgûl at the Fords of Bruinen (Arrow River)\nFilming took place in various locations across New Zealand. A list of filming locations, sorted by appearance order in the film:[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Fictionallocation\n | Specific locationin New Zealand\n | General areain New Zealand\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mordor (Prologue) | Whakapapa skifield | Tongariro National Park |\n| Hobbiton | Matamata | Waikato |\n| Gardens of Isengard | Harcourt Park | Upper Hutt |\n| The Shire woods | Otaki Gorge Road | Kāpiti Coast District |\n| Bucklebury Ferry | Keeling Farm, Manakau | Horowhenua |\n| Forest near Bree | Takaka Hill | Nelson |\n| Trollshaws | Waitarere Forest | Horowhenua |\n| Flight to the Ford | Tarras | Central Otago |\n| Ford of Bruinen | Arrow River, Skippers Canyon | Queenstown and Arrowtown |\n| Rivendell | Kaitoke Regional Park | Upper Hutt |\n| Eregion | Mount Olympus | Nelson\n |\n| Dead Marshes | Kepler Mire | Southland |\n| Dimrill Dale | Lake Alta | The Remarkables |\n| Dimrill Dale | Mount Owen | Nelson\n |\n| Lothlórien | Paradise | Glenorchy |\n| River Anduin | Upper Waiau River | Fiordland National Park |\n| River Anduin | Rangitikei River | Rangitikei District |\n| River Anduin | Poets' Corner | Upper Hutt\n |\n| Parth Galen | Paradise | Glenorchy\n |\n| Amon Hen | Mavora Lakes, Paradise and Closeburn | Southern Lakes |\n\n\n### Special effects[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* makes extensive use of digital, practical and make-up special effects. One notable illusion used in almost every scene involved setting a proper scale so that the characters all appear to be the correct height. For example, Elijah Wood is 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall in real life, but his character, Frodo Baggins, is barely four feet in height. A variety of techniques were used to depict the hobbits and Gimli the Dwarf as being of diminutive stature. Fortunately, John-Rhys Davies – who played Gimli – happens to be the correct height in proportion to the hobbit actors, so did not need to be filmed separately as a third height variation. Large- and small-scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including Bag End in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the edit between the two. Forced perspective was also employed, so that it would look as though the short hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.\n\n\nFor the battle between the Last Alliance and Sauron's forces that begins the film, an elaborate CGI animation system, called MASSIVE, was developed by Stephen Regelous; it allowed thousands of individual animated characters, or \"agents\" in the program, to act independently. This lent the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The \"Making of\" Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: for instance, in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the field could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy.\n\n\nThe digital creatures were important due to Jackson's requirement of biological plausibility. Their surface texture was scanned from large maquettes before numerous digital details of their skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the Balrog, Gray Horsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire.\n\n\n\n### Score[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (soundtrack)\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Music of *The Lord of the Rings* film series.\n\nJames Horner turned down the offer to compose the score.[46] The musical score for *The Lord of the Rings* films was composed by Howard Shore. It was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Voices, The London Oratory School Schola, and the Maori Samoan Choir, and featured several vocal soloists. Shore wrote almost four hours of finalized music for the film (of which just over three hours are used as underscore), featuring a number of non-orchestral instruments, and a large number (49–62) of leitmotives.\n\n\nTwo original songs, \"Aníron\" and the end title theme \"May It Be\", were composed and sung by Enya, who allowed her label, Reprise Records, to release the soundtrack to *The Fellowship of the Ring* and its two sequels. In addition to these, Shore composed \"In Dreams\", which was sung by Edward Ross of the London Oratory School Schola.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe world premiere of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was held at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 10 December 2001. It was released on Wednesday, 19 December 2001 internationally in most major territories on 10,000 screens.[47] It opened in New Zealand on 20 December.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nA special featurette trailer was released in 2000. The trilogy sizzle reel was shown before *Thirteen Days* and the teaser trailer before *Pearl Harbor*. The theatrical trailer was attached with the television premiere of *Angel* and before *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Both trailers appeared as Easter eggs on the *Rush Hour 2* and *Little Nicky* home video releases.\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on VHS and DVD on 6 August 2002.[48] It was the best-selling DVD release at the time with 14.5 million copies being sold. This record was dethroned by *Finding Nemo* the following year.[49]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Theatrical and extended release[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 November 2002, an extended edition was released on VHS and DVD, with 30 minutes of new material, added special effects and music, plus 19 minutes of fan-club credits, totaling to 228 minutes.[50][51][52] The DVD set included four commentaries and over three hours of supplementary material.\n\n\nOn 29 August 2006, a limited edition of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on DVD. The set included both the film's theatrical and extended editions on a double-sided disc along with all-new bonus material.\n\n\n\n#### Blu-ray edition[edit]\n\n\nThe theatrical Blu-ray version of *The Lord of the Rings* was released in the United States on 6 April 2010. There were two separate sets: one with digital copies and one without.[53] The individual Blu-ray disc of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on 14 September 2010 with the same special features as the complete trilogy release, except there was no digital copy.[54]\n\n\nThe extended Blu-ray editions were released in the US on 28 June 2011.[55] This version has a runtime of 238 minutes[51][56] (the extended editions include the names of all fan club members at the time of their release; the additional 10 minutes in the Blu-ray version are because of expanded member rolls, not any additional story material).\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released in Ultra HD Blu-ray on 30 November 2020 in the United Kingdom and on 1 December 2020 in the United States, along with the other films of the trilogy, including both the theatrical and the extended editions of the films.[57]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn its opening day, it grossed $18.2 million in the United States and Canada from 3,359 cinemas and $11.5 million in 13 countries, including $3 million from 466 screens in the United Kingdom.[3][58] It grossed $75.1 million in its first five days in the United States and Canada, including $47.2 million on its opening weekend, placing it at number one at the US box office, setting a December opening record, beating *Ocean's Eleven*.[59][3]\n\n\nThe film also opened at number one in 29 international markets and remained there for a second week in all but the Netherlands. It set a record opening day gross in Australia with $2.09 million from 405 screens, beating the record $1.3 million set by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*. It had a record opening weekend in Germany with 1.5 million admissions and in Spain with a gross of $5.3 million from 395 screens. It also grossed a record $2.5 million in 15 days in New Zealand.[60] This record would last for less than a decade before being surpassed by *Avatar*.[61] In its first 15 days, it had grossed $183.5 million internationally and $178.7 million in the United States and Canada for a worldwide total of $362.2 million.[60][3]\n\n\nIn its initial release, it went on to gross $313.4 million in the United States and Canada and $547.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $860.5 million.[5] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 54 million tickets in the US and Canada in its initial theatrical run.[62] Following subsequent reissues, the film has grossed $316.1 million in the United States and Canada and $582.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $898.2 million.[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Differences between *The Lord of the Rings* book and film series\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Full of eye-popping special effects, and featuring a pitch-perfect cast, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* brings J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to vivid life.\"[63] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[64] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[65]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released to universal critical acclaim. Colin Kennedy for *Empire* gave the film five stars out of five, writing \"Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s *The Fellowship of the Ring* as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history... Putting formula blockbusters to shame, *Fellowship* is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations...\"[66] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three out of four stars and stating that while it is not \"a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth\", it is \"a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right\".[67] *USA Today* also gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"this movie version of a beloved book should please devotees as well as the uninitiated\".[68] In his review for *The New York Times*, Elvis Mitchell wrote, \"The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is mentioned\".[69] Lisa Schwarzbaum for *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film an A grade and wrote \"The cast take to their roles with becoming modesty, certainly, but Jackson also makes it easy for them: His *Fellowship* flows, never lingering for the sake of admiring its own beauty ... Every detail of which engrossed me. I may have never turned a page of Tolkien, but I know enchantment when I see it\".[70] In his review for the BBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"Funny, scary, and totally involving\", and wrote that Jackson turned \"the book's least screen-worthy volume into a gripping and powerful adventure movie\".[71] In his review for *The Guardian*, Xan Brooks wrote \"Rather than a stand-alone holiday blockbuster, *The Fellowship of the Ring* offers an epic act one\", and commented that the ending was \"closer in spirit to an art-house film than a popcorn holiday romp\".[72]\n\n\nIn his review for the *New York Post*, Lou Lumenick gave the film four stars out of four, praising Jackson's direction, the casting, the sets, and the score, and describing the film as \"the three most exciting hours we've seen on a movie screen in years\" and \"easily one of the year's best movies\".[73] In her review for *The Washington Post*, Rita Kempley gave the film five stars out of five, and praised the cast, in particular, \"Mortensen, as Strider, is a revelation, not to mention downright gorgeous. And McKellen, carrying the burden of thousands of years' worth of the fight against evil, is positively Merlinesque\".[74] *Time* magazine's Richard Corliss praised Jackson's work: \"His movie achieves what the best fairy tales do: the creation of an alternate world, plausible and persuasive, where the young — and not only the young — can lose themselves. And perhaps, in identifying with the little Hobbit that could, find their better selves\".[75] In his review for *The Village Voice*, J. Hoberman wrote, \"Peter Jackson's adaptation is certainly successful on its own terms\".[76] *Rolling Stone* magazine's Peter Travers wrote, \"It's emotion that makes *Fellowship* stick hard in the memory... Jackson deserves to revel in his success. He's made a three-hour film that leaves you wanting more\".[77] A mixed review was written by Peter Bradshaw. Writing for *The Guardian*, he lauded the art direction and the visual look of the film, but he also commented \"there is a strange paucity of plot complication, an absence of anything unfolding, all the more disconcerting because of the clotted and indigestible mythic back story that we have to wade through before anything happens at all\". Overall, Bradshaw found the tone of the film too serious and self-important, and wrote \"signing up to the movie's whole hobbity-elvish universe requires a leap of faith... It's a leap I didn't feel much like making – and, with two more movie episodes like this on the way, the credibility gap looks wider than ever.\"[78] Jonathan Rosenbaum was also less positive about *The Fellowship of the Ring*: in his review for the *Chicago Reader*, he granted that the film was \"full of scenic splendors with a fine sense of scale\", but he commented that its narrative thrust seemed \"relatively pro forma\", and that he found the battle scenes boring.[79]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\nIn 2002, the film won four Academy Awards from thirteen nominations.[80] The winning categories were for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score.

He is best known for his portrayal of Frodo Baggins in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003) and *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012).\n\n\nWood made his film debut with a small part in *Back to the Future Part II* (1989). He went on to achieve recognition as a child actor with roles in *Avalon* (1990), *Paradise* (1991), *Radio Flyer* (1992), *Forever Young* (1992), *The Adventures of Huck Finn* (1993), and *The Good Son* (1993).

Following the success of *The Lord of the Rings*, Wood has appeared in a wide range of films, including *Spy Kids 3D: Game Over* (2003)*, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* (2004), *Sin City* (2005), *Green Street* (2005), *Everything Is Illuminated* (2005), *Paris, je t'aime* (2006), *Bobby* (2006), *Celeste and Jesse Forever* (2012), and *I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore* (2017).\n\n\nWood's voice roles include Mumble in the *Happy Feet* film franchise (2006–2011), the title protagonist in *9* (2009), Spyro the Dragon in the *Legend of Spyro* video game trilogy (2006–2008), Beck on Disney XD's *Tron: Uprising* (2012–2013), and Wirt in the Cartoon Network miniseries *Over the Garden Wall* (2014). He also played Ryan Newman on the FX dark comedy series *Wilfred* (2011–2014), for which he received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actor, and Todd Brotzman in the BBC America series *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency* (2016–2017).\n\n\nWood founded the record label Simian Records in 2005, which was dissolved in 2015. He directed the 2007 music video \"Energy\" for The Apples in Stereo. In 2010, Wood co-founded a film production company for horror films, The Woodshed, renamed SpectreVision in 2013. Wood is also a disc jockey and has toured globally with his friend Zach Cowie as the duo Wooden Wisdom.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nWood was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on January 28, 1981, the second of three children[1] born to Debbie (*née* Krause) and Warren Wood, who operated a delicatessen together.[2] He is of English, Danish,[3] Irish, and German ancestry, and was raised Catholic.[4][5][6] He has an older brother named Zachariah[7] and a younger sister named Hannah. At age seven, he began modeling and taking piano lessons in his hometown.[8][9] In elementary school, he appeared in *The Sound of Music* and played the title character in *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*. He also served as a choirboy in a production of *See How They Run*. His parents sold their delicatessen in 1989 and the family, without his father, moved to Los Angeles in order for Wood to pursue an acting career. His parents divorced when he was 15.[10]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1988–1998: Early work[edit]\n\n\nWood modeled and appeared in local commercials. He got his first break in the music video for Paula Abdul's \"Forever Your Girl,\" directed by David Fincher. This was followed by a pivotal role in the made-for-TV film, *Child in the Night,* and a minor role in *Back to the Future Part II*, as a boy from a futuristic 2015 who teases Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) for playing an arcade game because \"you have to use your hands\".[11] Nine-year-old Wood auditioned for a role in *Kindergarten Cop*, but was told by director Ivan Reitman that his performance was not believable, which Wood later said was \"a harsh thing to say to a nine-year-old.\"[12]\n\n\nPlaying Aidan Quinn's son in *Avalon* garnered professional attention for Wood; the film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards.[13] A small part in Richard Gere's *Internal Affairs* was followed by the role of a boy who brings estranged couple Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson back together in *Paradise* (1991). In 1992, Wood co-starred with Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis in *Forever Young*,[14] and with Joseph Mazzello in *Radio Flyer*.[15]\n\n\nIn 1993, Wood played the title character in Disney's adaptation of Mark Twain's novel, *The Adventures of Huck Finn*, and co-starred with Macaulay Culkin in the psychological thriller *The Good Son*. The following year, he starred in *The War*, alongside Kevin Costner. Roger Ebert's review of the film praised Wood highly, stating that Wood \"has emerged, I believe, as the most talented actor, in his age group, in Hollywood history.\"[16]\n\n\nWood's title role–opposite Bruce Willis–in the Robert Reiner film *North* (1994) was followed by a Super Bowl commercial for Lay's \"Wavy\" potato chips (with Dan Quayle).[17] In 1995, Wood appeared in the music video for The Cranberries' \"Ridiculous Thoughts,\"[18] played the lead role in *Flipper*, and co-starred in Ang Lee's critically acclaimed *The Ice Storm*.[19] In 1997, Wood played Jack \"The Artful Dodger\" Dawkins in a made-for-TV adaptation of *Oliver Twist*, alongside Richard Dreyfuss.[20] The following year, he had a leading role in the sci-fi disaster film *Deep Impact,* and a starring role in *The Faculty*, directed by Robert Rodriguez.

R. R. Tolkien's multi-volume novel. Wood was a fan of the book series, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[22] He was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[23] Wood was the first actor to be cast.[24] This gave Wood top billing, alongside a cast that included Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Miranda Otto, Sean Bean, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and John Rhys-Davies.[25][26][27] \nThe *Lord of the Rings* trilogy was filmed in New Zealand, in a process taking more than one year for principal photography alone, with pick-up shots annually for the next four years.[28][29]\nBefore the cast left the country, Jackson gave Wood two gifts: one of the One Ring props used on the set and Sting, Frodo's sword. He was also given a pair of prosthetic \"hobbit feet\" of the type worn during filming.[30]\n\n\nIn 2002, Wood lent his voice to the DTV release of *The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina*. Later that year, the second part of Peter Jackson's trilogy was released, titled *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, in which Wood had a reduced role from the first movie. \nIn 2003, Wood starred in the DTV film *All I Want* and also cameoed as 'The Guy' in *Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over*.

With a career spanning more than six decades, he is noted for his roles on the screen and stage in genres ranging from Shakespearean dramas and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction. He is regarded as a British cultural icon and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991.[2][3] He has received numerous accolades, including a Tony Award, six Olivier Awards, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards and five Emmy Awards.\n\n\nMcKellen made his stage debut in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's *Richard II* and Marlowe's *Edward II*. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain. He has earned five Olivier Awards for his roles in *Pillars of the Community* (1977), *The Alchemist* (1978), *Bent* (1979), *Wild Honey* (1984), and *Richard III* (1995). \n\n\nMcKellen made his Broadway debut in *The Promise* (1965). He went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role as Antonio Salieri in *Amadeus* (1980). He was further nominated for *Ian McKellen: Acting Shakespeare* (1984). He returned to Broadway in *Wild Honey* (1986), *Dance of Death* (1990), *No Man's Land* (2013), and *Waiting for Godot* (2013), the latter being a joint production with Patrick Stewart.[4]\n\n\nMcKellen achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in *Richard III* (1995), James Whale in *Gods and Monsters* (1998), Magneto in the *X-Men* films, and Gandalf in *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003) and *The Hobbit* (2012–2014) trilogies. Other notable film roles include *A Touch of Love* (1969), *Plenty* (1985), *Six Degrees of Separation* (1993), *Restoration* (1995), *Mr. Holmes* (2015), and *The Good Liar* (2019).\n\n\nMcKellen came out as gay in 1988, and has since championed LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[5] McKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] He is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation and FFLAG.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[9][10] the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[11] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951 after his father had been promoted.[11][12] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal\".[12] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old\".[13]\n\n\nMcKellen's father was a civil engineer[14] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[15] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[16] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met\".[17] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 25. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a Quaker, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying any more\".[18] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[19]\n\n\nMcKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[20] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[21] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to *Peter Pan* at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[11] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's reenactment of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".[11]\n\n\nHis sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, *Twelfth Night*,[22] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their *Macbeth* and Wigan High School for Girls' production of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[23]\n\n\nIn 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[24] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the college. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in *Henry IV* alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), *Cymbeline* (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and *Doctor Faustus*.[25][26][27] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a significant impact on McKellen's future career.[28]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1965–1985: National Theatre acclaim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen (Antonio Salieri) alongside Jane Seymour (Constanze Mozart) in *Amadeus*, c. 1981\nMcKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, as Roper in *A Man for All Seasons*, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's *Cymbeline* had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[25][27] After four years in regional repertory theatres, McKellen made his first West End appearance, in *A Scent of Flowers*, regarded as a \"notable success\".[25] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Shakespeare's *Richard II* (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Christopher Marlowe's *Edward II* (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh Festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[29]\n\n\nOne of McKellen's first major roles on television was as the title character in the BBC's 1966 adaptation of *David Copperfield*, which achieved 12 million viewers on its initial airings. After some rebroadcasting in the late 60s, the master videotapes for the serial were wiped, and only four scattered episodes (3, 8, 9 and 11) survive as telerecordings, three of which feature McKellen as adult David. McKellen had taken film roles throughout his career—beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in *A Touch of Love*, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in *Priest of Love*,[30] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[24] In 1969, McKellen starred in three films, Michael Hayes's *The Promise*, Clive Donner's epic film *Alfred the Great*, and Waris Hussein's *A Touch of Love* (1969).\n\n\nIn the 1970s, McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles. From 1973 to 1974, McKellen toured the United Kingdom and Brooklyn Academy of Music portraying Lady Wishfort's Footman, Kruschov, and Edgar in the William Congreve comedy *The Way of the World*, Anton Chekov's comedic three-act play *The Wood Demon* and William Shakespeare tragedy *King Lear*. The following year, he starred in Shakespeare's *King John*, George Colman's *The Clandestine Marriage*, and George Bernard Shaw's *Too True to Be Good*. From 1976 to 1977 he portrayed Romeo in the Shakespeare romance *Romeo & Juliet* at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The following year he played King Leontes in *The Winter's Tale*.[31]\n\n\nIn 1976, McKellen played the title role in William Shakespeare's *Macbeth* at Stratford in a \"gripping ... out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, and Iago in *Othello*, in award-winning productions directed by Trevor Nunn.[25] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn. From 1978 to 1979 he toured in a double feature production of Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night*, and Anton Chekov's *Three Sisters* portraying Sir Toby Belch and Andrei, respectively.[32] In 1979, McKellen gained acclaim for his role as Antonio Salieri in the Broadway transfer production of Peter Shaffer's play *Amadeus*. It was an immensely popular play produced by the National Theatre originally starring Paul Scofield. The transfer starred McKellen, Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze Mozart. *The New York Times* theatre critic Frank Rich wrote of McKellen's performance \"In Mr. McKellen's superb performance, Salieri's descent into madness was portrayed in dark notes of almost bone-rattling terror\".[33] For his performance, McKellen received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.[34]\n\n\nIn 1981, McKellen portrayed writer and poet D. H. Lawrence in the Christopher Miles directed biographical film, *Priest of Love*. He followed up with Michael Mann's horror film *The Keep* (1983). In 1985, he starred in *Plenty*, the film adaptation of the David Hare play of the same name. The film was directed by Fred Schepisi and starred Meryl Streep, Charles Dance, John Gielgud, and Sting. The film spans nearly 20 years from the early 1940s to the 1960s, around an Englishwoman's experiences as a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II when she has a one-night stand with a British intelligence agent. The film received mixed reviews with Roger Ebert of *The Chicago Sun-Times* praising the film's ensemble cast writing, \"The performances in the movie supply one brilliant solo after another; most of the big moments come as characters dominate the scenes they are in\".[35]\n\n\n\n### 1986–2000: Established actor[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, he returned to Broadway in the revival of Anton Chekhov's first play *Wild Honey* alongside Kim Cattrall and Kate Burton. The play concerned a local Russian schoolteacher who struggles to remain faithful to his wife, despite the attention of three other women. McKellen received mixed reviews from critics in particular Frank Rich of *The New York Times* who praised him for his \"bravura and athletically graceful technique that provides everything except, perhaps, the thing that matters most—sustained laughter\". He later wrote, \"Mr. McKellen finds himself in the peculiar predicament of the star who strains to carry a frail supporting cast\".[36] In 1989 he played Iago in production of *Othello* by the Royal Shakespeare Company.[37] McKellen starred in the British drama *Scandal* (1989) a fictionalised account of the Profumo affair that rocked the government of British prime minister Harold Macmillan. McKellen portrayed John Profumo. The film starred Joanne Whalley, and John Hurt. The film premiered at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and competed for the Palme d'Or. When his friend and colleague, Patrick Stewart, decided to accept the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the American television series, *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, McKellan strongly advised him not to throw away his respected theatrical career to work in television. However, McKellan later conceded that Stewart had been prudent in accepting the role, which made him a global star and later followed his example such as co-starring with Stewart in the *X-Men* superhero film series.[38]\n\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, he acted in a world tour of a lauded revival of *Richard III*, playing the title character. The production played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two weeks before continuing its tour where Frank Rich of *New York Times* was able to review it. In his piece, he praised McKellen's performance writing, \"Mr McKellen's highly sophisticated sense of theatre and fun drives him to reveal the secrets of how he pulls his victims' strings whether he is addressing the audience in a soliloquy or not\".[39] For his performance he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.[40]\n\n\nIn 1992, he acted in Pam Gems's revival of Chekov's *Uncle Vanya* at the Royal National Theatre alongside Antony Sher, and Janet McTeer. In 1993, he starred in the film *Six Degrees of Separation* based on the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award nominated play of the same name. McKellen starred alongside Will Smith, Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing. The film was a critical success. That same year, he also appeared in the western *The Ballad of Little Jo* opposite Bob Hoskins and the action comedy *Last Action Hero* starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year, he appeared in the superhero film *The Shadow* with Alec Baldwin and the James L. Brooks directed comedy *I'll Do Anything* starring Nick Nolte. \n\n\nIn 1995, McKellen made his screenwriting debut with *Richard III*, an ambitious adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name, directed by Richard Loncraine.[41][42] The film reimagines the play's story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Britain, with Richard depicted as a fascist plotting to usurp the throne. McKellen stars in the title role alongside an ensemble cast including Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Broadbent, Kristen Scott Thomas, Nigel Hawthorne and Dame Maggie Smith. As executive producer he returned his £50,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, *The Washington Post* film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] Film critic Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* praised McKellen's adaptation and his performance in his four star review writing, \"McKellen has a deep sympathy for the playwright ... Here he brings to Shakespeare's most tortured villain a malevolence we are moved to pity. No man should be so evil, and know it. Hitler and others were more evil, but denied out to themselves. There is no escape for Richard. He is one of the first self-aware characters in the theatre, and for that distinction he must pay the price\".[45] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. That same year, he appeared in the historical drama *Restoration* (1995) also starring Downey Jr., as well as Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, and David Thewlis. He also appeared in the British romantic comedy *Jack and Sarah* (1995) starring Richard E. Grant, Samantha Mathis, and Judi Dench.\n\n\nIn 1993, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries *Tales of the City*, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin. Later that year, McKellen appeared in the HBO television film *And the Band Played On* based on the acclaimed novel of the same name about the discovery of HIV. For his performance as gay rights activist Bill Kraus, McKellen received the CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[46] From 1993 to 1997 McKellen toured in a one-man show entitled, *A Knights Out*, about coming out as a gay man. Laurie Winer from *The Los Angeles Times* wrote, \"Even if he is preaching to the converted, McKellen makes us aware of the vast and powerful intolerance outside the comfortable walls of the theatre. Endowed with a rare technique, he is a natural storyteller, an admirable human being and a hands-on activist\".[47] From 1997 to 1998, he starred as Dr. Tomas Stockmann in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's *An Enemy of the People*.[48] Later that year he played Garry Essendine in the Noël Coward comedy *Present Laughter* at the West Yorkshire Playhouse.[49] In 1998, he appeared in the modestly acclaimed psychological thriller *Apt Pupil*, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King.[50] McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. That same year, he played James Whale, the director of *Frankenstein* in the Bill Condon directed period drama *Gods and Monsters*, a role for which he was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing it to Roberto Benigni in *Life is Beautiful* (1998).[24]\n\n\nIn 1995, he appeared in the BBC television comedy film *Cold Comfort Farm* starring Kate Beckinsale, Rufus Sewell, and Stephen Fry. The following year he starred as Tsar Nicholas II in the HBO made-for-television movie *Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny* (1996) starring Alan Rickman as Rasputin. For his performance, McKellen earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination and received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film win. McKellen appeared as Mr Creakle in the BBC series *David Copperfield* (1999) based on the Charles Dickens classic novel. The miniseries starred a pre-*Harry Potter* Daniel Radcliffe, Bob Hoskins, and Dame Maggie Smith.\n\n\n\n### 2000–2011: International stardom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the world premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* in Wellington, 1 December 2003\nIn 1999, McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film *X-Men* and its sequels *X2: X-Men United* (2003) and *X-Men: The Last Stand* (2006).[24] He later reprised his role of Magneto in 2014's *X-Men: Days of Future Past*, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's *X-Men: First Class*.[51]\n\n\nWhile filming the first *X-Men* film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation of *The Lord of the Rings* (consisting of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*), released between 2001 and 2003. He won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in *The Fellowship of the Ring* and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the *Lord of the Rings* films.[52]\n\n\nMcKellen returned to the Broadway stage in 2001 in an August Strindberg play *The Dance of Death* alongside Helen Mirren, and David Strathairn at the Broadhurst Theatre. *The New York Times* Theatre critic Ben Brantley praised McKellen's performance writing, \"[McKellen] returns to Broadway to serve up an Elysian concoction we get to sample too little these days: a mixture of heroic stage presence, actorly intelligence, and rarefied theatrical technique\".[53] McKellen toured with the production at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End and to the Sydney Art's Festival in Australia. On 16 March 2002, he hosted *Saturday Night Live*. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show *The Simpsons* in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long-running British soap opera, *Coronation Street*, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film *Eighteen* as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Kate Winslet at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007\nMcKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as *Emile* (which was shot in three weeks following the *X2* shoot),[54] *Neverwas* and *Asylum*. In 2006, he appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in *The Da Vinci Code* opposite Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. During a 17 May 2006 interview on *The Today Show* with the *Da Vinci Code* cast and director Ron Howard, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[55] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction'. I mean, walking on water? It takes ... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story\". He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[55]\n\n\nMcKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais's comedy series *Extras*, where he played himself directing Gervais's character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2007, McKellen narrated the romantic fantasy adventure film *Stardust* starring Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, which was a critical and financial success. That same year, he lent his voice to the armored bear Iorek Byrnison in the Chris Weitz-directed fantasy film *The Golden Compass* based on the acclaimed Philip Pullman novel *Northern Lights* and starred Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. The film received mixed reviews but was a financial success.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the 2007 BAFTA Awards\nIn 2007, he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of *King Lear* and *The Seagull*, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in *The Prisoner*, a remake of the 1967 cult series *The Prisoner*.[56] In 2009, he appeared in a very popular revival of *Waiting for Godot* at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[57][58] From 2013 to 2014, McKellen and Stewart starred in a double production of Samuel Beckett's *Waiting for Godot* and Harold Pinter's *No Man's Land* on Broadway at the Cort Theatre. *Variety* theatre critic Marilyn Stasio praised the dual production writing, \"McKellen and Stewart find plenty of consoling comedy in two masterpieces of existential despair\".[59] In both productions of Stasio claims, \"the two thespians play the parts they were meant to play\".[59] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[60] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n### 2012–present: Career expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Billy Crudup and Patrick Stewart promoting *Waiting for Godot* and *No Man's Land* (2013)\nMcKellen reprised the role of Gandalf on screen in Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation of *The Hobbit* starting with *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012), followed by *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* (2013), and finally *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014).[62] Despite the series receiving mixed reviews, it emerged as a financial success. McKellen also reprised his role as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in James Mangold's *The Wolverine* (2013), and Singer's *X-Men: Days of Future Past* (2014). In November 2013, McKellen appeared in the *Doctor Who* 50th anniversary comedy homage *The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot*.[63] From 2013 to 2016, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom *Vicious* as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years.[64][65] The show's original title was \"Vicious Old Queens\". There are ongoing jokes about McKellen's career as a relatively unsuccessful character actor who owns a tux because he stole it after doing a guest spot on \"Downton Abbey\" and that he holds the title of \"10th Most Popular ‘Doctor Who’ Villain\". Liz Shannon Miller of *IndieWire* noted while the concept seemed, \"weird as hell\", that \"Once you come to accept McKellen and Jacobi in a multi-camera format, there is a lot to respect about their performances; specifically, the way that those decades of classical training adapt themselves to the sitcom world. Much has been written before about how the tradition of the multi-cam, filmed in front of a studio audience, relates to theatre, and McKellen and Jacobi know how to play to a live crowd\".[66]\n\n\nIn 2015, McKellen reunited with director Bill Condon playing an elderly Sherlock Holmes in the mystery film *Mr. Holmes* alongside Laura Linney. In the film based on the novel *A Slight Trick of the Mind* (2005), Holmes now 93, struggles to recall the details of his final case because his mind is slowly deteriorating. The film premiered at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival with McKellen receiving acclaim for his performance. *Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers praised his performance writing, \"Don't think you can take another Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes? Snap out of it. Apologies to Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, but what Ian McKellen does with Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective in Mr Holmes is nothing short of magnificent ... Director Bill Condon, who teamed superbly with McKellen on the Oscar-winning Gods and Monsters, brings us a riveting character study of a lion not going gentle into winter\".[67] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins's Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's *The Dresser*, alongside Edward Fox, Vanessa Kirby, and Emily Watson.[68] Television critic Tim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised the film and the central performances writing, \"there's no escaping that Hopkins and McKellen are the central figures here, giving wonderfully nuanced performances, onscreen together for their first time in their acclaimed careers\".[69] For his performance McKellen received a British Academy Television Award nomination for his performance.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen in 2019\nIn 2017, McKellen portrayed in a supporting role as Cogsworth (originally voiced by David Ogden Stiers in the 1991 animated film) in the live-action adaptation of Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after *Gods and Monsters* and *Mr. Holmes*) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[70] The film was released to positive reviews and grossed $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film, the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and the 17th highest-grossing film of all time.[71][72][73] In 2017, McKellen appeared in the documentary *McKellen: Playing the Part*, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor.\n\n\nIn October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at the Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[74] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[75][76] To celebrate his 80th birthday, in 2019 McKellen performed in a one-man stage show titled *Ian McKellen on Stage: With Tolkien, Shakespeare, Others and YOU* celebrating the various performances throughout his career. The show toured across the UK and Ireland (raising money for each venue and organisation's charity) before a West End run at the Harold Pinter Theatre and was performed for one night only on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre.[77]\n\n\nThe following year, he appeared in Kenneth Branagh's historical drama *All is True* (2018) portraying Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, opposite Branagh and Judi Dench. In 2019, he reunited with Condon for a fourth time in the mystery thriller *The Good Liar* opposite Helen Mirren, who received praise for their onscreen chemistry.[78] That same year, he appeared as Gus the Theatre Cat in the movie musical adaptation of *Cats* directed by Tom Hooper. The film featured performances from Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench. The film was widely panned for its poor visual effects, editing, performances, screenplay, and was a box office disaster.[79] In 2021, he played the title role in an age-blind production of *Hamlet* (having previously played the part in a UK and European tour in 1971), followed by the role of Firs in Chekov's *The Cherry Orchard* at the Theatre Royal, Windsor.[80][81]\n\n\nIn 2023 he is set to star in period thriller *The Critic* directed by Anand Tucker. The film is written by Patrick Marber adapted off the 2015 novel *Curtain Call* by Anthony Quinn. The film will premiere at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.[82]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[83] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972.[84] They lived in Earls Terrace, Kensington, London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor.[84] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, it was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends, with Mathias later directing McKellen in *Waiting for Godot* at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[85] As of 2005, McKellen had been living in Narrow Street, Limehouse, for more than 25 years, more than a decade of which had been spent in a five-storey Victorian conversion.[86]\n\n\nMcKellen is an atheist.[87] In the late 1980s, he lost his appetite for every kind of meat but fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[88] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[89]\n\n\nMcKellen has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the *Lord of the Rings* and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. All but one of the other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo (John Rhys-Davies did not get the tattoo, but his stunt double Brett Beattie did).[90][91]\n\n\nMcKellen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[92] In 2012, he stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment\".[93]\n\n\nMcKellen became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[94] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and *X-Men* co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[95]\n\n\nMcKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[96] He was made a Freeman of the City of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. He was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[97] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Manchester Pride 2010\nWhile McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public while appearing on the BBC Radio programme *Third Ear* hosted by conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne.[99] The context that prompted McKellen's decision, overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career, was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[24] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[100][24][101] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[24] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, \n\n\n> I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[102]\n> \n> \n\n He has said of this period: \n\n\n> My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[17]\n> \n> \n\n Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.\n\n\nIn 2003, during an appearance on *Have I Got News For You*, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay\".[103][104] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Europride 2003 in Manchester\nMcKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented:\n\n\n\n\n> I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about—nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[106]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation[8] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[107]\n\n\nIn 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[17] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[108] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[7] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[6]\n\n\n\nIn 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:\n\n\n> I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one ... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[109]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[110] In December 2008, he was named in *Out*'s annual Out 100 list.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[112] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[113]\n\n\nIn 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[114]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.[115]\n\n\nA cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[116][117]\n\n\nMcKellen is an honorary board member for the New York- and Washington, D.C.-based organization Only Make Believe.[118] Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012[119] and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013.[120] He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage.\n\n\nMcKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming *The Hobbit* in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (*Waiting for Godot* in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[121] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[122]\n\n\nTogether with a number of his *Lord of the Rings* co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 McKellen joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nA friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to *For Ian Charleson: A Tribute*.[124] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[125][126] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ian McKellen on screen and stage\n\n## Accolades and honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ian McKellen\n\n![](image)The hands of McKellen on a 1999 *Gods and Monsters* plaque in London's Leicester Square\nMcKellen has received two Academy Award nominations for his performances in *Gods and Monsters* (1999), and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001).

Jane* (1997), *A Perfect Murder* (1998), *A Walk on the Moon* (1999), and *28 Days* (2000).\n\n\nMortensen gained international attention for playing Aragorn in the fantasy trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003). He gained acclaim for his collaborations with filmmaker David Cronenberg in the thrillers *A History of Violence* (2005), *Eastern Promises* (2007), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and *A Dangerous Method* (2011).[4] He gained additional Academy Award nominations for his leading roles as an anarchist father in *Captain Fantastic* (2016) and as Tony Lip in *Green Book* (2018). Mortensen made his directorial debut with *Falling* (2020), in which he also starred.\n\n\nAside from acting, Mortensen has explored fine arts, photography, poetry, and music. In 2002, he founded the Perceval Press to publish both his works and the works of little-known artists and authors. Mortensen sang and composed for part of *The Lord of the Rings* soundtrack and has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was born in New York City on October 20, 1958,[3] the son of Grace Gamble (née Atkinson; July 8, 1928 – April 25, 2015) and Viggo Peter Mortensen Sr. (May 8, 1929 – March 2, 2017). His mother was American, while his father was Danish. They met in Norway.[5] His maternal grandfather was a Canadian from Nova Scotia. His paternal grandmother was from Trondheim, Norway.[6][7]\n\n\nThe family moved to Venezuela, then Denmark, and eventually settled in Argentina. They lived successively in the provinces of Córdoba, Chaco, and Buenos Aires. Mortensen attended primary school and acquired a fluent proficiency in Spanish while his father managed poultry farms and ranches.[8] He was baptized Lutheran, the tradition of his father.[9]\n\n\nWhen Mortensen was 11 and his brothers 8 and 6, their parents divorced. The three boys returned with their mother to the United States, where Viggo spent the rest of his childhood in New York State. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1976.[10][11] He attended St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, earning a bachelor's degree in 1980 in Spanish studies and politics.[12]\n\n\nUpon graduating, Mortensen went to Europe, living for a time in the United Kingdom and Spain, before returning to Denmark. There he took various jobs such as driving trucks in Esbjerg and selling flowers in Copenhagen.[13][14] He eventually returned to the United States to pursue an acting career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\n### 1980s–1990s: First films[edit]\n\n\nMortensen's first film role was in *The Purple Rose of Cairo* (1985), but his scenes were deleted from the final cut.[16] His first onscreen appearance was playing an Amish farmer in Peter Weir's *Witness*. He was cast in *Witness* because the director thought he had the right face for the part of an Amish man. He had also been simultaneously cast for another role as a soldier in Shakespeare in the Park's production of *Henry V*, but he decided to choose acting in the film because he wanted to try something new. He credited that decision and the very positive experience on the film as the start of his film career.[17]\n\n\nAlso in 1985, he was cast in the role of Bragg on the TV series *Search for Tomorrow*. Mortensen's 1987 performance in *Bent* at the Coast Playhouse, Los Angeles, won him a Dramalogue Critics' Award. The play, about homosexual prisoners in a concentration camp, was known for the leading performance by Ian McKellen.[18] Mortensen later costarred with him in the film trilogy *The Lord of the Rings*. In 1987, Mortensen guest starred as a police detective on the hit TV series *Miami Vice.*[19]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Mortensen appeared in supporting roles in a variety of films, including Jane Campion's *The Portrait of a Lady*, *Young Guns II*, *Prison*, *Boiling Point*, *Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III*, Sean Penn's *The Indian Runner*, Danny Cannon's *The Young Americans*, Carl Colpaert's *The Crew*, which won the São Paulo Film Festival Audience Award, Brian de Palma's *Carlito's Way*, *Crimson Tide*, *G.I. Jane*, *Daylight*, *A Walk on the Moon*, *American Yakuza*, Charles Robert Carner's remake *Vanishing Point*, Philip Ridley's films *The Reflecting Skin* and *The Passion of Darkly Noon*, the remake films *A Perfect Murder* and Gus Van Sant's *Psycho* (the 1998 remakes of two Alfred Hitchcock's movies *Dial M for Murder* and *Psycho*), *28 Days*, and *The Prophecy*, with Christopher Walken. Of these roles, Mortensen was probably best known for playing Master Chief John Urgayle in *G.I. Jane*.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2000s: *The Lord of the Rings* and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, December 1, 2003\nAnother major mainstream breakthrough came in 1999, when Peter Jackson cast him as Aragorn in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy. According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for Stuart Townsend, and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son's enthusiasm for the J. R. R. Tolkien novel.[21] He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Aragorn, and was ranked No. 15 on a 2015 survey of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" conducted by *Empire*.[22]\n\n\nIn *The Two Towers* DVD extras, the film's swordmaster, Bob Anderson, described Mortensen as \"the best swordsman I've ever trained.\" Mortensen often performed his own stunts, and even the injuries he sustained during several of them, including two broken toes, did not dampen his enthusiasm. At one point during shooting of *The Two Towers*, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Brett Beattie (stunt double for John Rhys-Davies) all had painful injuries, and during a shoot of them, running in the mountains, Peter Jackson jokingly referred to the three as \"the walking wounded.\"[23] Also, according to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, Mortensen purchased the two horses, Uraeus and Kenny, whom he had ridden and bonded with over the duration of the films.[24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Mortensen starred as Frank Hopkins in *Hidalgo*, the story of an ex-army courier who travels to Arabia to compete with his horse, Hidalgo, in a dangerous desert race for a contest prize.[25]\n\n\n\nMortensen starred in David Cronenberg's 2005 film *A History of Violence* as a family man revealed to have had an unsavory previous career. He was nominated for a Satellite Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for this role.[26] In the DVD extras for *A History of Violence*, Cronenberg related that Mortensen is the only actor he had come across who would come back from weekends with his family with items he had bought to use as props on the set.[27] \n\n![](image)Mortensen interviewed by eTalk Daily at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, for *A History of Violence*\nIn 2006, he starred as Captain Diego Alatriste in the Spanish language film *Alatriste*, based on the series of novels *The Adventures of Captain Alatriste*, written by the Spanish writer Arturo Pérez-Reverte.[28]\n\n\nIn September 2007, the film *Eastern Promises*, directed by David Cronenberg, was released to critical acclaim for the film itself and for Mortensen's performance as a Russian gangster on the rise in London. His nude fight scene in a steam room was applauded by Roger Ebert: \"Years from now, it will be referred to as a benchmark.\"[29] Mortensen's performance in *Eastern Promises* resulted in his winning the Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film award from the British Independent Film Awards.[30] He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.[31]\n\n\nMortensen appeared as himself in the 2009 film *Reclaiming The Blade*, in which he discussed his passion for the sword and his sword-work in films such as *The Lord of the Rings* and *Alatriste*. Mortensen also talked about his work with Bob Anderson, the swordmaster on *The Lord of the Rings*, *Alatriste*, *Pirates of the Caribbean* and many others.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the 32nd Genie Awards in March 2012\nIn 2009, Mortensen performed in *The People Speak*, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn's *A People's History of the United States*. While it was reported in April 2009 that Mortensen had, at least temporarily, retired from film acting,[33] Mortensen said he was misquoted. In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have \"plans to do another movie\" at the time and that he was \"taking a little break now. I don't have anything lined up.\"[34] In 2009 he joined the cast of *The Road*, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name,[35] and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on *A Dangerous Method*.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s–present: Critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\nAfter two years, Mortensen returned to theater in 2011, starring in Ariel Dorfman's *Purgatorio* (\"Purgatory\") in Madrid.[37] *Purgatorio* is Mortensen's first play in Spanish. The play is about a man and woman confined either a psychiatric hospital or prison together. During production, Mortensen's mother became ill and he pulled out of the initial premiere date, the first time he had ever done so for a project. The play premiered from November 4 to December 18.[38]\n\n\nDuring production for the 2012 film *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, Mortensen was offered to reprise his role as Aragorn, but he declined because the character does not appear in the novel the film is based on.[39]\n\n\nMortensen starred in the 2016 film *Captain Fantastic*, for which he received his second Academy Award nomination.[40] Alonso Duralde of *TheWrap* praised Mortensen's performance, saying, \"The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant, and impatient but also warm, loving, and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and a passionate defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes, and more with subtlety and grace\".[41]\n\n\nIn 2018, he starred in the film *Green Book*. Mortensen portrayed Tony Lip, an Italian-American bouncer hired to drive and protect pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow South from 1962 to 1963. Reflecting on the character, Mortensen stated, \"I was attracted to playing Tony in part because it was a different kind of character, but the main thing I liked about him was his heart\".[42] Mortensen received his third Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Lip.[43]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Mortensen together with Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson from *The Lord of the Rings* in May 2020 joined actor Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart*, which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[44]\n\n\nIn 2020 he released his directorial debut *Falling* which he also wrote, produced, composed the score for and starred in alongside Lance Henriksen.[45] Mortensen had based the story on his own family's history, including his parents suffering from dementia. The film is dedicated to his brothers, Charles and Walter Mortensen.[46]\n\n\nMortensen was cast as British cave diver Rick Stanton in the biographical film *Thirteen Lives* directed by Ron Howard which was released in July 2022.[47] Mortensen was taught cave diving by Stanton personally to prepare for the role.[48]\n\n\nHe reunited with David Cronenberg in the horror sci-fi film *Crimes of the Future* alongside Kristen Stewart with filming beginning in August 2021.[49] Mortensen will also reunite with Lisandro Alonso on the film *Eureka*.[50] Mortensen and Caleb Landry Jones will star together in the Vietnam War thriller *Two Wolves* which will be directed by documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney.[51]\n\n\nHe wrote, directed, and stars in a Western film titled *The Dead Don't Hurt*. It also stars Vicky Krieps and it was shot in Mexico.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Literary and arts career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen in 2010\n### Perceval Press[edit]\n\n\nWith part of his earnings from *The Lord of the Rings*, Mortensen founded the Perceval Press publishing house—named after the knight from the legend of King Arthur—to help other artists by publishing works that might not find a home in more traditional publishing venues.[54] *Perceval Press* is also the home of Mortensen's many personal artistic projects in the area of fine arts, photography, poetry, song, and literature.[55]\n\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nMortensen is also an author, with various books of poetry, photography, and painting published. His poems are written in English, Danish, and Spanish. With anthropologists Federico Bossert and Diego Villar, he has written several works related to ethnography of natives in South America,[56] specifically in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

His paintings are frequently abstract and often contain fragments of his poetry therein.[63] His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in *A Perfect Murder* are his own.[64]\n\n\nMortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music. Viggo was first introduced to Buckethead's work while working on sounds for an educational CD on Greek mythology. The finished product included a guitar part by Buckethead, which caught Viggo's ear and led him to initiate contact with the guitarist. The collaboration grew from there.[65]\n\n\nMortensen's discography includes:[66]\n\n\n\n* 1994: *Don't Tell Me What to Do*\n* 1997: *One Less Thing to Worry About*\n* 1998: *Recent Forgeries*\n* 1999: *The Other Parade*\n* 1999: *One Man's Meat*\n* 1999: *Live at Beyond Baroque*\n* 2003: *Pandemoniumfromamerica*\n* 2004: *Live at Beyond Baroque II*\n* 2004: *Please Tomorrow*\n* 2004: *This, That, and the Other*\n* 2005: *Intelligence Failure*\n* 2006: *3 Fools 4 April*\n* 2007: *Time Waits for Everyone*\n* 2008: *At All*\n* 2010: *Canciones de Invierno*\n* 2011: *Reunion*\n* 2013: *Acá*\n* 2015: *Under the Weather*\n* 2016: *Seventeen Odd Songs*\n* 2017: *Preguntas Desde la Orilla*\n* 2018: *Godzilla Sleeps Alone*\n\nMortensen is featured on *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* soundtrack, singing \"Aragorn's Coronation\" (the name of the extended version of this song in the 3rd original sound track is \"The Return of the King\"), the words by Tolkien and the music composed by Mortensen.[67] In the extended DVD edition of the first *Lord of the Rings* movie, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, he sings the song \"The Lay of Beren and Lúthien\".[68]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\nMortensen holds dual American and Danish citizenship.[1] He has stated that he was raised speaking English and Spanish, and sometimes feels that, when speaking Spanish, he \"can get to the heart of the matter better\".[69]\n\n\nMortensen met singer Exene Cervenka in 1986 on the set of the comedy *Salvation!* The couple married on July 8, 1987. On January 28, 1988, Cervenka gave birth to their son, who later played his on-screen son in the film *Crimson Tide* in 1995. His son graduated from Columbia University in 2010 with a B.A. in archaeology and has been working at Perceval Press, which was founded by his father.[70][71][72] Mortensen and Cervenka lived in Idaho for three years.[73] They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1997.[74] Since 2009, he has been in a relationship with Spanish actress Ariadna Gil. Though the couple reside in Madrid, Mortensen spends much of his time in the United States, and has stated, \"I am a citizen and longtime resident of the United States and am attached to its landscapes, history, and people.\"[75][76] He has owned property in Sandpoint, Idaho, and spends time there when not filming movies.[77]\n\n\nMortensen has talked about his family's struggles with dementia, seeing both of his parents, three of his four grandparents, aunts, uncles, and his stepfather battle the condition.[78] In 2016, Mortensen traveled to New York to take care of his father,[75] who died a year later.[78] Two years earlier, Mortensen's mother had also died from complications of the condition.[78]\n\n\nMortensen was a close friend of Icelandic painter Georg Guðni Hauksson until the latter's death in 2011. He had long been an admirer of Georg Guðni's work as a landscape artist, and the two published books together as well as maintaining a close friendship.[79]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMortensen has expressed a liking for association football, ice hockey and baseball. His favorite teams include Argentine club San Lorenzo de Almagro,[80] English team Fulham,[81] Spanish team Real Madrid,[82] Turkish team Beşiktaş,[83] and both the Argentine and Danish national teams.[84] His favorite soccer players are Diego Maradona and Héctor \"Bambino\" Veira.[85] He is a fan of the Montreal Canadiens and wore a Canadiens shirt underneath his costume throughout the filming of the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy.[86] During the 100th anniversary celebrations of the Montreal Canadiens, Mortensen introduced one of his idols, Guy Lafleur, to the crowd at the Bell Centre in Montreal.[87] He is also a fan of the New York Mets and, in an interview promoting 2009 film *The Road*, was seen wearing apparel indicating his support for the Australian Football League's Collingwood Magpies.[88] While appearing on the *Late Show with David Letterman*, he held a sign supporting the New York Giants of the NFL.[89]\n\n\n\n### Political activities[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was one of the signers of the \"Toronto Declaration\" protesting against spotlighting Tel Aviv at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.[90][91]\n\n\nIn 2015 Mortensen donated $1,000 to Irish political party Sinn Fein.[92]\n\n\nMortensen endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for U.S. president during the primaries for the 2016 election.[93] After Sanders failed to win the Democratic Party nomination, Mortensen endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[94] He wrote an open letter just before Election Day 2016 in which he listed the reasons he disagreed with Hillary Clinton’s policies and could not support her in the race against Donald Trump, though he thought that Clinton would be elected president.[95] He went on to narrate a documentary, *The Revolution Televised*, about the 2016 presidential election and the protests in the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention.[96]\n\n\nSince 2018 Mortensen has been a member of the Catalan NGO Òmnium Cultural, a pro-independence organization dedicated to promoting Catalan culture and language in the arts and the public sphere.[97] His longtime partner and her extended family were supporters of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. In 2019, he publicly criticized the use of his character Aragorn by the far-right Spanish party Vox during the campaign for the 2019 Spanish general election.[98]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

His acting roles include Mikey Walsh in *The Goonies* (1985), Billy Tepper in *Toy Soldiers* (1991), Daniel Ruettiger in *Rudy* (1993), Samwise Gamgee in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003), Doug Whitmore in *50 First Dates* (2004), Bill in *Click* (2006), Lynn McGill in the fifth season of *24* (2006), Oso in *Special Agent Oso* (2009–2012), Raphael in *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* (2012–2017), Bob Newby in the second season of Netflix's *Stranger Things* (2017),[1] and Ed in *No Good Nick* (2019).\n\n\nAstin is the son of actress Patty Duke and adopted by actor John Astin. He has received various recognitions including a Screen Actors Guild Award and two Young Artist Awards. Astin was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1994 for the short film *Kangaroo Court*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAstin was born in Santa Monica, California, on February 25, 1971, as the son of actress Patty Duke (1946–2016) and Michael Tell (born 1950).[2][3][4] However, at the time, it was reported that entertainer Desi Arnaz Jr. was his biological father. During that time, Duke also had a personal relationship with Michael Tell, a writer, music promoter, and publisher of the newspaper *The Las Vegas Israelite*. When Duke became pregnant, she was unsure whether Arnaz or Tell was the father, so Tell offered to marry her as a way out of the scandal. The marriage lasted only 13 days in 1970, and ended before Astin was born.[5][6][7]\n\n\nOn August 5, 1972, Duke married actor John Astin, having been in a relationship with him for two years. When the wedding guests were invited to speak, 18-month-old Astin looked at John and cried, \"Daddy!\", to which the Episcopal priest performing the ceremony remarked, \"Well, that about does it!\"[8] John subsequently adopted Astin. In 1973, Duke gave birth to Astin's brother Mackenzie Astin, who also became an actor. Duke and John Astin divorced in 1985.[9] Duke married Mike Pearce in 1986,[5] and they adopted a son, Kevin, in 1989.[9]\n\n\nWhen Astin was 14, Duke told him that Arnaz was his father, and the two developed a relationship. However, in his mid-20s, Astin met a relative of Michael Tell who suggested they were related. Sean set out to find the truth about his biological father, and underwent genetic tests which showed Tell was his biological father.[10] Astin has maintained close relationships with all three, and saying: \"Desi Arnaz Jr. loves me, and I love him. We are so close ... Science tells me ... that he's not my biological father. Science tells me that Mike Tell is.\" Astin considers John his father, as John was the one who raised him. Astin is also close to his stepfather, Mike Pearce, saying, \"I can call any of them on the phone any time I want to. John, Desi, Mike, or Papa Mike ... my four dads.\"[5]\n\n\nAstin is of German and Irish ancestry through his mother and Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish through his biological father.[11][12][13] Astin attended Catholic school and later became a Protestant.[14]\n\n\nAstin attended the Crossroads High School for the Arts and undertook master classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory in Los Angeles. He graduated cum laude from UCLA with a B.A. in History and English (American literature and culture). An alumnus of Los Angeles Valley College, Astin served on the school's board of directors of the Patrons Association and the Arts Council.[15]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astin in 1997\nAstin's first acting role was in a 1981 television film titled *Please Don't Hit Me, Mom*,[16] in which he played an 8-year-old child with an abusive mother (portrayed by his real-life mother Patty Duke). Astin made his film debut at the age of 13 as Mikey in *The Goonies* (1985).\n\n\nAfter *The Goonies*, Astin appeared in several more films, including the Disney television film *The B.R.A.T. Patrol*, opposite Nia Long, Tim Thomerson, and Brian Keith; *Like Father Like Son* (1987); *White Water Summer* with Kevin Bacon (1987), *The War of the Roses* (1989); the World War II film *Memphis Belle* (1990); *Toy Soldiers* (1991); *Encino Man* (1992); and the college football biopic *Rudy* (1993), about the life-changing struggles and rewards of the titular character, Daniel Ruettiger.\n\n\nIn 1994, Astin directed and co-produced (with his wife, Christine Astin) the short film *Kangaroo Court*, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Live Action Short Film. Astin continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, including the Showtime science fiction film *Harrison Bergeron* (1995), the Gulf War film *Courage Under Fire* (1996), and the Warren Beatty political satire *Bulworth* (1998).\n\n\n\n### *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Astin played Samwise Gamgee in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy, consisting of *The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001), *The Two Towers* (2002), and *The Return of the King* (2003). Many awards were bestowed upon the trilogy, particularly its final installment, which earned eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Astin received seven award nominations for his own performance, and won five, including the Saturn Award, the Sierra Award, the Seattle Film Critics Award, and the Utah Film Critics Award (all for Best Supporting Actor), and the Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male or Female in an Effects Film.[17][*better source needed*] *The Return of the King* cast as an ensemble received awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, the Screen Actors Guild, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, and received a Gold Derby Award.[18][*better source needed*]\n\n\nThroughout the filming process, Astin became close friends with several cast members, and became particularly good friends with costar Elijah Wood. Astin's daughter, Alexandra, is in the closing scene of *The Return of the King*. She plays his onscreen daughter, Elanor Gamgee, who runs out to him as he returns from the Grey Havens.\n\n\nWhile working on *The Lord of the Rings*, Astin persuaded a number of fellow cast and crew members, including director Peter Jackson, to assist him in making his second short film, *The Long and Short of It*. The film, which takes place on a street in Wellington, New Zealand, premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and can be found on the DVD for *The Two Towers*, along with a \"making of\" video.\n\n\nIn 2004, Astin released *There and Back Again* (ISBN 0-312-33146-0), a memoir (co-written with Joe Layden) of his film career with emphasis on his experiences during production of *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The title is derived from the title of J. R. R. Tolkien's novel *The Hobbit*, as well as the fictional book written by Bilbo Baggins in *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n\n\n### After *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astin at UIUC, 2009\nSince *The Lord of the Rings*, Astin has continued to work in film and television. His film roles have included the Adam Sandler comedies *50 First Dates* and *Click*. Astin played the role of Malibu High School principal Mike Matthews in the film *Smile*.[19][*better source needed*]\n\n\nIn television, Astin guest-starred as Lynn McGill in ten episodes of the fifth season of the Fox drama *24*. He also appeared in the made-for-TV films *Hercules* and *The Colour of Magic* and in episodes of *Monk*, *Las Vegas*, *My Name is Earl* (in which he parodied his 1993 film *Rudy* with co-stars Charles S. Dutton and Chelcie Ross), and *Law & Order*, among other shows. Astin directed a 2003 episode of the TV series *Angel*, titled \"Soulless\".

He made his breakthrough as the character Legolas in *The Lord of the Rings* film series. He reprised his role in *The Hobbit* film series. Considered by some to be the Errol Flynn of his time,[4][5][6] he gained further notice appearing in epic fantasy, historical, and adventure films, notably as Will Turner in the *Pirates of the Caribbean* film series, Paris in *Troy* (2004), Balian de Ibelin in *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005), and the Duke of Buckingham in *The Three Musketeers* (2011).\n\n\nBloom appeared in Hollywood films such as the war film *Black Hawk Down* (2001), the Australian Western *Ned Kelly* (2003), the romantic comedy *Elizabethtown* (2005), and *New York, I Love You* (2007). In 2020 he gained acclaim for the Afghanistan War drama film *The Outpost* (2020). He also starred in the Amazon Prime Video series *Carnival Row* (2019–2023).\n\n\nHe made his professional stage debut in *In Celebration* at the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End in 2007 and starred in a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet* in 2013. He returned to the theatre in a West End revival of Tracy Letts' *Killer Joe* in 2018. In 2009, Bloom was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In 2015 he received the BAFTA Britannia Humanitarian Award.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBloom was born on 13 January 1977 in Canterbury, Kent, and was named after the 16th-century English composer Orlando Gibbons.[8][9] He has an older sister, Samantha Bloom.[10]\n\n\nBloom initially believed that his biological father was his mother's husband, the South African-born anti-apartheid novelist Harry Bloom (1913–1981), who died when Bloom was four years old. However, when he was thirteen, Bloom's mother revealed to him that his biological father was actually Colin Stone, his mother's partner and family friend.[11][12][13] Stone, the principal of the Concorde International language school,[14] became Orlando Bloom's legal guardian after Harry Bloom's death.[13]\n\n\nBloom's mother, Sonia Constance Josephine (*née* Copeland), was born in Kolkata, India, the daughter of British parents Francis John Copeland, a physician and surgeon, and Betty Constance Josephine (*née* Walker), who were from Kent. Through her, Bloom is a cousin of photographer Sebastian Copeland.[15][16] Bloom's mother's family lived in Tasmania (Australia), Japan, and India.[11]\n\n\nBloom was brought up in the Church of England.[17] He attended St Peter's Methodist Primary School,[18] then the junior school of The King's School before proceeding to St Edmund's School Canterbury. Bloom was discovered to be dyslexic,[13][19] and was encouraged by his mother to take art and drama classes.[13] After being spurred into action following his school prize submission to panto actor Richard Sieben in 1992, in 1993, he moved to London to follow a two-year A-Level course in Drama, Photography and Sculpture at Fine Arts College, Hampstead. He then joined the National Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and earning a scholarship to train at the British American Drama Academy.[20] Bloom began acting professionally with television roles in episodes of *Casualty* and *Midsomer Murders*,[13] and subsequently made his film debut in *Wilde* (1997), opposite Stephen Fry, before entering the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he studied acting.[21]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBloom's first appearance on the screen was in a small role, as a rent boy, in the 1997 film *Wilde*. Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999,[22] he was cast in his first major role, playing Legolas in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003).[20] He had originally auditioned for the part of Faramir, who does not appear until the second movie, but the director, Peter Jackson, cast him as Legolas instead. While shooting a scene, he broke a rib after falling off a horse, but eventually recovered and continued shooting.[23] At the same time, Bloom also played a brief role in Ridley Scott's war film *Black Hawk Down* as PFC Todd Blackburn. In 2002, he was chosen as one of the *Teen People* \"25 Hottest Stars Under 25\", despite him having turned 25, and was named *People*'s hottest Hollywood bachelor in the magazine's 2004 list.[20] All members of the cast of the Rings films were nominated for Best Ensemble Acting at the Screen Actors Guild Awards for three years in a row, finally winning in 2003 for the third film, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*. Bloom has also won other awards, including European Film Awards, Hollywood Festival Award, Empire Awards and Teen Choice Awards, and has been nominated for many others. Most of Bloom's box office successes have been as part of an ensemble cast.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2005 Venice Film Festival\nBloom next starred opposite Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp in *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl*, which was a blockbuster hit during the summer of 2003. After the success of *Pirates*, Bloom next took to the screen as Paris, the man who effectively started the Trojan War, in the 2004 Spring blockbuster, *Troy* opposite Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole. He subsequently played the lead roles in Ridley Scott's *Kingdom of Heaven* and Cameron Crowe's *Elizabethtown* (both 2005). In 2006, Bloom starred in sequel *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* and in the independently made *Haven*, of which he was also executive producer. In the same year he was one of the guest stars in the sitcom *Extras*, in which he portrayed an exaggeratedly arrogant, narcissistic version of himself who had a great loathing for Johnny Depp (his co-star in *Pirates of the Caribbean*); Bloom pushed for *Extras* to go further by making his part unlikable, and contributed to the gag about him admiring Depp out of sheer jealousy, that Depp was far more talented than he was, not to mention rated higher than him on the 'top hottest' charts.[25] Also in 2006, Bloom was the most searched male on Google News.[13] As of May 2007, Bloom has appeared in four of the top 15 highest-grossing films of all time.[22]\n\n\nBloom then again portrayed Will Turner, in *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End*, released on 24 May 2007. Bloom, who had intended to become a stage actor after graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, had stated that he would like to leave films for a time and instead appear in stage roles,[20] and is \"avidly looking for the right sort of material that [he] can do something with\"[26] and go \"back to basics.\"[27] During the summer of 2007, he appeared in a London revival of *In Celebration*, a play by David Storey.[27][28] His character was one of three brothers returning home for their parents' 40th wedding anniversary.[29] On 24 August 2007 he made his first ever TV commercial appearance on late-night Japanese TV, promoting the Uno brand of cosmetics maker Shiseido. A \"one night only\", 2-minute version of the Sci-Fi themed commercial kicked off the product's marketing campaign.[30] In 2008 he signed on to play a small role in the British film *An Education*[31] but dropped out to take the lead in Johnnie To's film *Red Circle*. Also in 2009, he was one of many stars to appear in *New York, I Love You*, which contained 12 short films in one.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2010 *Cinema for Peace* gala in Berlin, Germany\nBloom appeared in *The Three Musketeers* opposite Milla Jovovich, Logan Lerman, Matthew Macfadyen, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Juno Temple and Christoph Waltz, released in 2011. Bloom reprised his role as Legolas in parts two and three of *The Hobbit*, Peter Jackson's three-part prequel to *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy.[32] He made his Broadway stage debut as Romeo in *Romeo and Juliet* in August 2013 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre.[33] *The New York Times* theatre critic Ben Brantley described Bloom's performance as \"a first-rate Broadway debut\" in the title role: \"For once, we have a Romeo who evolves substantively, from a posturing youth in love with love, to a man who discovers the startling revelation of real love, with a last-act descent into bilious, bitter anger that verges on madness.\"[34]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Bloom stated that he would like to return for a fifth *Pirates of the Caribbean* film. Bloom did reprise his character, Will Turner, in a supporting role in the fifth film, *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*, which was released in May 2017.[35]\n\n\nBloom starred in the Trafalgar Studios production of *Killer Joe* in 2018. Bloom is currently starring in the Amazon Prime TV show *Carnival Row*, which was filming its second season in Prague before temporarily postponing production due to COVID-19. Together with a number of his *Lord of the Rings* co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 he joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[36]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Bloom starred in the war film *The Outpost* in which he portrayed the character of captain Benjamin Keating. In 2023, he played Danny Moore, a Nissan marketing executive in the sports film *Gran Turismo* based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2015 British Fashion Awards\nBloom has said that he tries \"not to exclude himself from real life as much as possible.\"[13] During filming in Morocco for *Kingdom of Heaven*, Bloom rescued and adopted a dog, Sidi (a black Saluki mix with a white mark on his chest).[37][38]\n\n\nIn 2004, he became a full member of SGI-UK (the UK branch of Soka Gakkai International), a lay Buddhist association affiliated with the teachings of Nichiren.[39][40]\n\n\nBloom has also been a part of Global Green, an environmental company, since the early 2000s.[24] As part of his environmental involvement, he has renovated his London home to use solar panels, incorporate recycled materials, and has used energy efficient lightbulbs.[13][24] Bloom has been approached by UNICEF to act as an international ambassador.[24]\n\n\nInvolved in modelling work, in 2002 he starred opposite English actress Kate Beckinsale in a Gap television advertisement directed by Cameron Crowe.[41]\n\n\nBloom has a tattoo of the Elvish word \"nine\" on his right wrist, written in fictional Tengwar Elvish script, a reference to his involvement in *The Lord of the Rings* as one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and Elijah Wood) got the same tattoo with the exception of John Rhys-Davies whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[42][43][44][45] Bloom also has a tattoo of a sun on his lower left abdomen, which he got at age 15 before moving to London.\n\n\nOn 12 February 2009, Bloom actively participated in the 'Australia Unites' fundraiser to raise support for the victims of the Australian bushfires on 7 February 2009.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2009, Bloom speaking to a schoolboy in Ukraine in 2016\nOn 12 October 2009, Bloom was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He has been involved in the organisation since 2007 and has visited schools and villages in Nepal in support of sanitation and education programmes.[47] Bloom also visited the city of Sloviansk in the east of Ukraine in April 2016 to raise awareness of the education crisis facing children during the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014–2015.[48] In 2023, Bloom returned to Ukraine again as a Goodwill Ambassador. Bloom met children affected by the war at a children's centre in Kyiv and met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[49]\n\n\nBloom has sustained several injuries: he broke his left arm and cracked his skull three times, broke his nose while playing rugby union, broke his right leg skiing in Switzerland, broke his left leg in a motorbike crash, and broke his right wrist while snowboarding.[22] He also broke his back when he slipped trying to reach a roof terrace of a friend's house and fell three floors.[50] He also broke some ribs while shooting *The Lord of the Rings*.[51]\n\n\nOn 13 July 2009, four hooded teenagers broke into the Hollywood Hills home of Bloom and stole nearly half a million dollars' worth of possessions. The burglars, dubbed the \"Bling Ring,\" targeted the homes of celebrities.

He is best known for playing Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck in Peter Jackson's film trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003), and Charlie Pace on the ABC television drama *Lost* (2004–2010).\n\n\nMonaghan first gained fame as Hetty Wainthropp's sidekick Geoffrey in *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates* (1996–1998). His first film role was as Sasha in the television film *Hostile Waters* (1997) based on the true story of a Soviet and a US submarine colliding in the Cold War. His other film roles include playing the young mutant Chris Bradley formerly known as Maverick in the superhero film *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* (2009) and playing Beaumont Kin in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019), reuniting with J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of *Lost.* He also has hosted the nature programme *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* (2012–2016).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMonaghan was born in West Berlin, West Germany, to British parents: Maureen, a nurse, and Austin Monaghan, who was of Irish descent, a science teacher.[3] Monaghan's family lived in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart and Münster, moving about every four years. When he was about 11 years old, his family moved to Heaton Moor in Stockport, England.[4] In Stockport, he attended St Anne's Roman Catholic High School (where his uncle taught and later became head teacher) and Aquinas College, where he studied English literature, drama and geography.\n\n\n\n## Career and events[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Monaghan held many occupations when he was younger, he long wanted to be an actor. After his second year at St Anne's, Monaghan became a regular in school plays such as *Oliver Twist*, *A Christmas Carol* and *Bugsy Malone* before joining the Manchester Youth Theatre. There, he was scouted for *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates*, in which he starred alongside Patricia Routledge and Derek Benfield as Hetty's under-aged sidekick, Geoffrey Shawcross, for four series. Monaghan has since credited Routledge as \"an amazing teacher\" who taught him some \"very valuable lessons\" that have influenced his acting career.[5][6][*non-primary source needed*] He made his feature-film debut as Russian sailor Sasha in the TV film *Hostile Waters*.[7]\n\n\nMonaghan later starred in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy as Meriadoc Brandybuck, for which he achieved international acclaim and success. Monaghan narrated *Ringers: Lord of the Fans*, a documentary about *The Lord of the Rings* fandom. He also provided the narration for The Discovery Channel's documentary *Devil's Bible* in 2008. He also appeared in *Soldiers of Fortune* alongside Sean Bean and Christian Slater. \nHe was a regular cast member on the ABC series *Lost* from 2004 to 2007, playing English former rockstar and drug addict Charlie Pace. Monaghan originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer. The role of Charlie was then changed from an old, washed up rocker from the 1980s, to a young one-hit wonder to accommodate Monaghan's age. Monaghan returned to the series as a special guest star after departing from the main cast.\n\n\nIn 2009, Monaghan starred as Chris Bradley / Bolt in *X-Men Origins: Wolverine*. On 15 July 2009, it was confirmed that he would join the cast of ABC Studios' science-fiction television series *FlashForward* as the character Simon. The series premiered on 24 September 2009.[8] It was cancelled after its first season.[9]\n\n\nOn 18 March 2010, Monaghan was spotted at the Universal Sheraton filming a short titled *Gloria*. It was part of a programme titled REESES Puff's Extraordinary Cinema (where the teenagers replace the pros[*clarification needed*]). He played the part of Caleb Reese.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 2010, Monaghan and US actress Megan Fox made an appearance as a couple in an abusive relationship in the music video for Rihanna and Eminem's song \"Love the Way You Lie\". Scenes include the celebrities on top of a liquor store. Fox and Monaghan also filmed inside the store and \"at a seedy dive bar next door\" to the store.[12]\n\n\nIn November 2012, a new show on Channel 5 titled *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* started airing in the United Kingdom. The documentary shows Monaghan travelling to different locations such as Venezuela and Ecuador to film and interact with the exotic and often dangerous local wildlife.[13]\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, Monaghan appeared in various live-action teasers for 2K Marin's science-fiction video game *The Bureau: XCOM Declassified*.[14]\n\n\nMonaghan is a fan of *The Gaffer Tapes: Fantasy Football Podcast* and has appeared as a guest in both April-November 2016 and May 2018, as well as submitting several audio questions which are played on the podcast. While appearing as a guest, Monaghan said \"It's the best fantasy football podcast out there\".[15]\n\n\nMonaghan is a contributing writer for the music and culture magazine *Paste*, primarily writing articles about Premier League football.[16]\n\n\nMonaghan is the voice of Sightseeing Manchester's bus tour, recorded in March 2016.\n\n\nSince August 2018, he has been starring as a serial killer in Channel 9 Australia's murder-mystery/drama TV series *Bite Club*, which is filmed in and around Sydney.\n\n\nHe was named as part of the cast for the last film in the sequel trilogy which is *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*, reuniting with J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of *Lost*. He appeared as Beaumont.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Monaghan joined together with fellow *Lord of the Rings* castmates Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, along with writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson, to appear on Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart,* which reunites the cast of popular films through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[17] Monaghan and castmate Billy Boyd started the podcast *The Friendship Onion* where they talk about their time filming *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMonaghan is a nature lover and has been active in the planting of trees and cacti. He bought a mango-tree forest in India.[18] Monaghan has a great love for insects and reptiles that he developed during his childhood, and has kept an exotic assortment of pets, including a leaf-mantis named Gizmo, a black widow spider named Witchitar and an albino snake named Blink.[19] The newly discovered species of spider *Ctenus monaghani* (de:Ctenus monaghani) is named after him.[20]\n\n\nAn avid outdoorsman, Monaghan enjoys activities such as surfing, kayaking, snowboarding, football, basketball and hiking. He has also explained that he likes hunting for insects and reptiles outdoors. He learned karate as a child, used to practise yoga and often goes to the gym for strength and weight training. He is a longtime fan of Manchester United since his childhood.[21]\n\n\nMonaghan loves to play all games and has hosted game nights for fellow cast members in the past, and is also fond of *The New York Times*' crossword puzzle. He enjoys playing *League of Legends* with fellow *Lord of the Rings* cast member Billy Boyd. He is fluent in English and German.[22]\n\n\nOn his right arm he has a tattoo of the English word \"nine\" written in the artificial script of Tengwar, a reference to his involvement in *The Lord of the Rings* and the fact that his character was one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. Seven other cast members and John Rhys-Davies' stunt double also got matching tattoos during the film's production, at Monaghan's instigation. Below that tattoo is another that reads, \"Life imitates art\", an Oscar Wilde quote. On his left arm is a tattoo, \"Living is easy with eyes closed\", a line from The Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". He also has two stars tattooed on his left foot: one black, and one white.[23] In 2010, Monaghan got two more tattoos, one on the upper side of the back (\"Love you take is equal to the love you make\", taken from the song \"The End\" by The Beatles). The other, done by Kat Von D on the reality TV series *LA Ink*, is located on his lower right arm and reads \"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter\", a quote from Yoda.\n\n\nHe resides in Los Angeles, California. In 2008, Monaghan held a photographic exhibition in Los Angeles in which he sold prints of his own works.

He has also received three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations with one win, and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\n\n\n![](image)John Rhys-Davies at Galaxy Con Richmond in 2023\nRhys-Davies is also known for his performances in the films *Victor/Victoria* (1982), *The Living Daylights* (1987), *The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement* (2004), and *Aquaman* (2018). He is also known for his extensive voice work including *Aladdin and the King of Thieves* (1996), *The Jungle Book 2* (2003), *Gargoyles* (1995–1996), and *SpongeBob SquarePants* (2000–2002).\n\n\nHe also gained acclaim for his television roles as Macro in *I, Claudius* (1976), Vasco Rodrigues in *Shōgun* (1980), and Michael Malone in *The Untouchables* (1993). From 1995 to 1997 he portrayed Professor Maximillian Arturo in *Sliders*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies was born in Salisbury on 5 May 1944,[1] the son of Welsh parents. His mother, Phyllis Jones, was a nurse, while his father, Rhys Davies, was a mechanical engineer and colonial officer.[2]\n\n\nDue to his father's work as a colonial police officer, he was raised in Tanganyika (today part of Tanzania) before his family moved to the Welsh town of Ammanford.[1] While in Tanganyika, his family lived in places such as Dar es Salaam, Kongwa, Moshi, and Mwanza. He was educated at independent Truro School in Cornwall and then at the University of East Anglia, where he was one of the first 105 students admitted and became a co-founder of its drama club. After a stint teaching at a secondary school in Watton, Norfolk, he won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies (right) signing autographs in May 2005\nRhys-Davies appeared sporadically on UK television in the early 1970s, including his role as the gangster \"Laughing Spam Fritter\" opposite Adam Faith in *Budgie*. Later he played Praetorian officer Naevius Sutorius Macro in *I, Claudius*. He then began to appear more frequently, and not just in the UK, with roles as a Portuguese navigator Rodrigues in the 1980 television miniseries *Shogun*, based on the novel by James Clavell, and as Sallah in the 1981 film *Raiders of the Lost Ark*.[3] He reprised the role of Sallah in two subsequent *Indiana Jones* films.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, he played Marvel Comics character Kingpin in *The Trial of the Incredible Hulk*.[5] Rhys-Davies also starred in another Clavell adaption, *Noble House*, set in Hong Kong, in which he plays Ian Dunross' corporate enemy, Quillan Gornt.[6] He has since appeared in numerous television shows and miniseries, including Agent Michael Malone in the 1993 remake of the 1950s television series *The Untouchables*[7] as well as a leading role in the television series *Sliders* as Professor Maximillian Arturo from 1995 to 1997.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)John Rhys Davies at Galaxy Con Richmond in 2023\nHe also appeared in *Reilly, Ace of Spies* in 1983, made several appearances in *Star Trek: Voyager* as a holodeck version of Leonardo da Vinci,[9] starred as an ally of James Bond in *The Living Daylights*, and appeared in the film *One Night with the King*. Davies has played the character Porthos in two separate projects; a two-part episode of *The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne*, and the Hallmark Channel film *La Femme Musketeer*. He appears in the full motion video cut scenes of computer games including *Ripper* (as Vigo Haman) (1996), *Dune 2000* (as Noree Moneo) (1998), and the *Wing Commander* series (as James Taggart, doubling as the voice of Thrakhath nar Kiranka in the third game of the series).\n\n\nIn 2004, he narrated *The Privileged Planet*, a documentary that makes the case for intelligent design.[10] He also provided narration in the MTV series Wildboyz around this time. In 2013, he appeared in the family history programme *Coming Home*, in which he discovered information about his grandfather's life in the Carmarthenshire coal mines.[11]\n\n\nIn 2014, he joined the cast of the television show *Metal Hurlant Chronicles* to play Holgarth, an immortal alchemist.[12]\n\n\nIn 2015, he had a role in the single-player campaign of the PC game *Star Citizen* alongside Mark Hamill and Gary Oldman.[13] The work consisted of full body motion capture, including facial expressions and his voice; it was recorded primarily at the Imaginarium studios in the UK.[14]\n\n\n\n### *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies appeared as the dwarf Gimli in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The cinematography of the films was aided in that Rhys-Davies is tall – 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), compared to the actors playing hobbits at around 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m).[15] Therefore, although his character was supposed to be short, he was properly in proportion compared to the hobbit actors. Had he been of more similar height, shots of the entire fellowship would have required three camera passes rather than two.[16]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is the only one of the nine Fellowship of the Ring actors who did not receive a tattoo of the word \"nine\" written in the Tengwar script; his stunt double, Brett Beattie, was offered the tattoo instead as Rhys-Davies was disinclined to get one himself and Beattie had spent so much time as his double that he almost received co-credit.[17]\n\n\nRhys-Davies suffered severe reactions to the prosthetics used during filming, and his eyes sometimes swelled shut. When asked whether he would consider returning to the role for the film version of *The Hobbit*, he said, \"I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more.\" He added that this time around \"[t]hey've got a different set of problems ... because you've got 13 dwarves, a whole band of them ... You're trying to represent a whole race ... You're trying to do for dwarves what *The Lord of the Rings* did for hobbits.\"[18] He offered help as a dwarf advisor in 2011, but ruled out returning as Gimli in *The Hobbit* because of the punishing makeup required.[19]\n\n\n\n### Voice work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies in September 2012\nIn addition to voicing the Ent Treebeard in *Lord of the Rings*, Rhys-Davies has lent his distinctive voice to many video games and animated television series, including the role of Hades in *Justice League*, the original voice of Man Ray in *SpongeBob SquarePants* (until both roles were recast to Bob Joles), and numerous times in *Gargoyles* (1994–1996), as the character Macbeth. He also lent his vocal talents to the games *Freelancer* (as Richard Winston Tobias) and *Lords of Everquest* (both in 2003) and the game *Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness*, which was released with his narration on a CD-ROM version in 1995. He also had a voice role on *Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance* as the character Jherek, and narrated a documentary called *The Glory of Macedonia*. Next Generation magazine gave its *Dune 2000* review 'an automatic one-star deduction for featuring John \"Multimedia Whore\" Rhys-Davies in the FMV.'[20]\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies' voice can be heard on the 2009 documentary *Reclaiming The Blade*.[21] In the narration, Rhys-Davies explores swords, historical European swordsmanship and fight choreography on film, a topic very familiar to him from his experiences in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, where his character wielded an axe in many scenes.\n\n\nIn 2004, he was the unknowing subject of an internet prank that spread false rumours in several mainstream media sources that he was scheduled to play the role of General Grievous in *Star Wars Episode III*.[22]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is the narrator of *The Truth & Life Dramatized audio New Testament Bible*, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, fully dramatised audiobook version of the New Testament which uses the Revised Standard Version-Catholic Edition translation. In 2011, he presented *KJB: The Book That Changed The World*, which features him reading diverse snippets from the King James Version.\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies’ voice work also includes voice-over work with *Breathe Bible*.[23]\n\n\nIn 2016, he provided spoken words for *Voices of Fire*, the sixth album by a cappella power metal band van Canto.[24]\n\n\nA resident of the Isle of Man since 1988, John Rhys-Davies provides the introductory voice-over to the Island's Castle Rushen, one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in the British Isles. In 2018, he lent his voice to the Isle of Man's tourism commercial.\n\n\nRhys-Davies voice was recorded for some of the callouts in the 1993 Williams SuperPin *Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure*[25]\n\n\n  \n\nIn the 2023 game Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, he reprises the role of voicing Gimli and can be heard narrating the opening scene.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies in April 2013\nRhys-Davies married Suzanne Wilkinson in December 1966, and they had two sons together. Although they legally separated in 1985, they remained married until her death from Alzheimer's disease in 2010. They remained friends, and he took care of her in her final years.[26]\n\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies began dating Lisa Manning. They have a daughter together, and split their time between homes in the New Zealand region of Waikato[27] and on the Isle of Man.[28]\n\n\n\n### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is a self-described \"rationalist\" and \"sceptic\" when it comes to religion. However, he holds Christianity in high regard and has stated that \"Christian civilisation has made the world a better place than it ever was.\"\n\n\nIn February 2020, Rhys-Davies stated, \"All the things that we value, the right of free speech, the right of the individual conscience, these evolved in first and second century Roman Christendom, where the individual Christian said, 'I have a right to believe, what I believe and not what the Emperor tells me.' From that our whole idea of democracy and the equality that we have has developed. We owe Christianity the greatest debt of thanks that a generation can ever have, and to slight it and to dismiss it as being irrelevant is the detritus of rather ill-read minds, I think.\"[29][30]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is not a member of any political party. He was a radical leftist as a university student in the 1960s, but changed his views when he went to heckle Margaret Thatcher, who he said \"shot down the first two hecklers in such brilliant fashion that [he] decided [he] ought for once to shut up and listen\".[31]\n\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies said in an interview with *World* magazine, \"There is a demographic catastrophe happening in Europe that nobody wants to talk about, that we daren't bring up because we are so cagey about not offending people racially. And rightly we should be. But there is a cultural thing as well. By 2020, 50% of the children in Holland under the age of 18 will be of Muslim descent.\"[32] In an interview with the conservative journal *National Review*, he said that he is opposed to Islamic extremism because he feels that it violates the \"Western values\" of equality, democracy, tolerance, and the abolition of slavery.[31]\n\n\nRhys-Davies was vocal about his support for Brexit.[33] On 25 April 2019, he appeared as a panelist on the BBC's *Question Time*, where he debated Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with Green Party politician Caroline Lucas. After Lucas suggested Trump should not be afforded a state visit to the UK, due to having lost the popular vote, Rhys-Davies banged his hands on the table and shouted \"“Oh woman! Have you never read Kenneth Arrow and the Arrows theorem?\" His conduct was subsequently described as \"thuggish and sexist\" by some viewers.[34][35] Rhys-Davies has since commented on his response, saying \"I was annoyed. It’s impossible to gather your thoughts when you’ve got someone making faces and twittering.
