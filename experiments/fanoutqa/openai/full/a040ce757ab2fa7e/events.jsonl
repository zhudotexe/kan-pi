The loser in the double-chance round hosted the elimination round game-winner, with the winner clinching the 8th seed and the loser being eliminated.[43]\n\n\n\n### Eastern Conference[edit]\n\n\n|\n|  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | **Play-in games** |  |  | **No. 8 seed game** |  |  | **Final seeds** |\n|  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | 7 | *Miami* | 105 |  | 8 | Atlanta | No. 7 seed |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | **8** | **Atlanta** | **116** |  |  |  |  |  | 7 | Miami | No. 8 seed |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  | **7** | ***Miami*** | **102** |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 10 | Chicago | 91 |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 9 | *Toronto* | 105 |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | **10** | **Chicago** | **109** |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n**Bold** Game winner  \n\n*Italic* Team with home-court advantage\n\n\n\n### Western Conference[edit]\n\n\n|\n|  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | **Play-in games** |  |  | **No. 8 seed game** |  |  | **Final seeds** |\n|  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | **7** | ***LA Lakers*** | **108** (OT) |  | 7 | LA Lakers | No. 7 seed |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 8 | Minnesota | 102 |  |  |  |  |  | 8 | Minnesota | No. 8 seed |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  | **8** | ***Minnesota*** | **120** |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 10 | Oklahoma City | 95 |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 9 | *New Orleans* | 118 |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | **10** | **Oklahoma City** | **123** |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n**Bold** Game winner  \n\n*Italic* Team with home-court advantage\n\n\n\n## Playoffs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 NBA playoffs\n\nThe playoffs began on April 15, 2023. \n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from 2023 NBA playoffs § Bracket.[edit]\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | First round |  |  | Conference semifinals |  |  | Conference finals |  |  | NBA Finals |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | E1\n | *Milwaukee*\\*\n | 1\n |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | E8\n | Miami\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  |  | E8\n | Miami\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | E5\n | *New York* | 2\n |  |\n|  | E4\n | *Cleveland* | 1\n |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | E5\n | New York | 4\n |  |\n|  |  | E8\n | Miami\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  | Eastern Conference |  |\n|  |  |  | E2\n | *Boston*\\*\n | 3\n |  |\n|  | E3\n | *Philadelphia* | 4\n |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | E6\n | Brooklyn | 0\n |  |\n|  |  | E3\n | Philadelphia\n | 3\n |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | E2\n | *Boston*\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  | E2\n | *Boston*\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | E7\n | Atlanta | 2\n |  |\n|  |  | E8\n | Miami\\*\n | 1\n |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | W1\n | *Denver*\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  | W1\n | *Denver*\\*\n | 4\n |  |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | W8\n | Minnesota | 1\n |  |\n|  |  | W1\n | *Denver*\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | W4\n | Phoenix\n | 2\n |  |\n|  | W4\n | *Phoenix* | 4\n |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | W5\n | LA Clippers | 1\n |  |\n|  |  | W1\n | *Denver*\\*\n | 4\n |  |\n|  | Western Conference |  |\n|  |  |  | W7\n | LA Lakers\n | 0\n |  |\n|  | W3\n | *Sacramento*\\*\n | 3\n |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | W6\n | Golden State | 4\n |  |\n|  |  | W6\n | *Golden State* | 2\n |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | W7\n | LA Lakers\n | 4\n |  |\n|  | W2\n | *Memphis*\\*\n | 2\n |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | W7\n | LA Lakers | 4\n |  |\n\n* \\* Division winner\n* Bold Series winner\n* *Italic* Team with home-court advantage\n\n**Bold** Game winner  \n\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Individual statistic leaders[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Player | Team(s) | Statistic\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Points per game | Joel Embiid | Philadelphia 76ers | 33.1\n |\n| Rebounds per game | Domantas Sabonis | Sacramento Kings | 12.3\n |\n| Assists per game | James Harden | Philadelphia 76ers | 10.7\n |\n| Steals per game | O.G.

The Podoloff Trophy was originally given to the NBA's Most Valuable Player of the regular season until 2021. The MVP trophy was then renamed in honor of Michael Jordan, a five-time winner and often considered the greatest player in league history. A new award, the Clutch Player of the Year Award, was also introduced to honor players who best come through for their teammates in the clutch. This trophy was named after Jerry West.\n\n\nThe league also announced updated trophy designs for the Coach of the Year Award, Defensive Player of the Year Award, Executive of the Year Award, Most Improved Player Award, Rookie of the Year Award, Sixth Man of the Year Award, Sportsmanship Award, and the Teammate of the Year Award. The Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Player, Rookie of the Year and Sixth Man of the Year trophies were then renamed in honor of Hakeem Olajuwon, George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, and John Havlicek respectively.[44][45]\n\n\n\n### Yearly awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2022–23 NBA awards\n| Award | Recipient(s) | Finalists[46] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Most Valuable Player | Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers)[47] | Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks)Nikola Jokić (Denver Nuggets) |\n| Defensive Player of the Year | Jaren Jackson Jr. (Memphis Grizzlies)[48] | Brook Lopez (Milwaukee Bucks)Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers) |\n| Rookie of the Year | Paolo Banchero (Orlando Magic)[49] | Walker Kessler (Utah Jazz)Jalen Williams (Oklahoma City Thunder) |\n| Sixth Man of the Year | Malcolm Brogdon (Boston Celtics)[50] | Bobby Portis (Milwaukee Bucks)Immanuel Quickley (New York Knicks) |\n| Most Improved Player | Lauri Markkanen (Utah Jazz)[51] | Jalen Brunson (New York Knicks)Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder) |\n| Clutch Player of the Year | De'Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)[52] | Jimmy Butler (Miami Heat)DeMar DeRozan (Chicago Bulls) |\n| Coach of the Year | Mike Brown (Sacramento Kings)[53] | Mark Daigneault (Oklahoma City Thunder)Joe Mazzulla (Boston Celtics) |\n| Executive of the Year | Monte McNair (Sacramento Kings)[54] | Koby Altman (Cleveland Cavaliers)Calvin Booth (Denver Nuggets)Justin Zanik (Utah Jazz) |\n| NBA Sportsmanship Award | Mike Conley Jr. (Minnesota Timberwolves)[55] | Boban Marjanović (Houston Rockets)Darius Garland (Cleveland Cavaliers)Bam Adebayo (Miami Heat)Harrison Barnes (Sacramento Kings)Jalen Brunson (New York Knicks) |\n| Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award | Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)[56] |  |\n| Community Assist Award | Brook Lopez (Milwaukee Bucks)[57] |  |\n| Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion Award | Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors)[58] | Chris Paul (Phoenix Suns)Jaren Jackson Jr. (Memphis Grizzlies)Tre Jones (San Antonio Spurs)Grant Williams (Boston Celtics) |\n| NBA Hustle Award | Marcus Smart (Boston Celtics)[59] |  |\n| NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award (Western) | Nikola Jokić (Denver Nuggets)[60] |  |\n| NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award (Eastern) | Jimmy Butler (Miami Heat)[61] |  |\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * **All-NBA First Team**:[62]\n\t+ F Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n\t+ F Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics\n\t+ C Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers\n\t+ G Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks\n\t+ G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder\n | * **All-NBA Second Team**:\n\t+ F Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat\n\t+ F Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics\n\t+ C Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets\n\t+ G Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\t+ G Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\n | * **All-NBA Third Team**:\n\t+ F Julius Randle, New York Knicks\n\t+ F LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers\n\t+ C Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento Kings\n\t+ G De'Aaron Fox, Sacramento Kings\n\t+ G Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers\n\n\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **NBA All-Defensive First Team**:[63]\n\t+ F Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies\n\t+ F Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\t+ C Brook Lopez, Milwaukee Bucks\n\t+ G Jrue Holiday, Milwaukee Bucks\n\t+ G Alex Caruso, Chicago Bulls\n | * **NBA All-Defensive Second Team**:\n\t+ F O.G.

renamed Kaseya Center on April 4, 2023.[103] It was previously renamed to Miami-Dade Center on January 12 after the previous naming rights deal with FTX was terminated due to the company's bankruptcy.[104][105]\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### National[edit]\n\n\nThis is the seventh year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV.[106] ESPN broadcasts Wednesday and Friday night games for most of the season, and games during selected Sunday nights from February to April. ABC airs *NBA Saturday Primetime* during eight games selected Saturday nights between December and March, with a tripleheader on January 28, the first tripleheader on the network outside of Christmas Day along with a Saturday afternoon game on January 14. The network also broadcasts *NBA Sunday Showcase* on three selected Sunday afternoons in February and early March.[107] TNT airs Tuesday games all season, and Thursday games from January to April.[108] NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when neither ESPN/ABC nor TNT are airing games nationally.[109]\n\n\nFive Christmas Day games were scheduled for this season. ABC was originally scheduled to air just a tripleheader, but it was later decided that all five Christmas games would be simulcast across both ABC and ESPN for the first time, likely in an attempt to counterprogram the NFL's scheduling of a Christmas Day tripleheader for the first time.[110][111] Previously, the most Christmas games that either network had ever aired in any given season was three.\n\n\nFour games were held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with TNT and NBA TV each airing two of them.[42]\n\n\nThe NBA designed January 24–28 as \"NBA Rivals Week\", with every nationally televised game featuring \"classic and budding rivalries between teams and players\".[42]\n\n\nOn March 8, ESPN had another all-female crew for an NBA game for the second straight year. The 7:30pm (ET) telecast between the Dallas Mavericks and the New Orleans Pelicans had Beth Mowins and Doris Burke as commentators, with Cassidy Hubbarth on the sideline, while the 10:00pm (ET) telecast between the Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles Clippers had Mike Breen and Mark Jackson as commentators, with reporter Ros Gold-Onwude joining the broadcast team as an analyst/color commentator.[112][113]\n\n\nOn the final day of the regular season, April 9, two games with playoff implications were flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.[42][107]\n\n\n\n### Local[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in NBC Sports Washington, which carries broadcasts of the Washington Wizards and the NHL's Washington Capitals, both Monumental-owned teams. Monumental initially took minority ownership of the network in 2016. NBC will provide transitional corporate, technical, and distribution support up to 18 months after the sale, and Monumental plans to rebrand the network after the 2022–23 season.[114][115]\n\n\nIn October 2022, the Clippers launched a direct-to-consumer streaming service called ClipperVision. The service includes all non-national games.[116]\n\n\nOn February 24, 2023, the AT&T SportsNet regional sports networks sent letters to the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz saying they had until March 31, 2023, to reach an agreement to take their local television rights back. Warner Bros. Discovery, the owners of the networks, intends to leave the regional sports networks business. If a deal is not reached the networks would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Portland Trail Blazers's deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network.[117][118]\n\n\nOn March 14, Diamond Sports Group, the operator of the Bally Sports regional sports networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond plans to continue to broadcast games for the 16 NBA teams it has regional rights to while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization.[119]\n\n\n\n## Notable occurrences[edit]\n\n\n* The NBA and NBPA announced a pension plan for former ABA players who played at least three seasons in the league.[120]\n* The Board of Governors approved the permanent adoption of the NBA play-in tournament that had been in place for the previous two seasons. Previously, the Board approved the tournament on a season-by-season basis.[121]\n* The league instituted a new penalty for the \"take foul\". The offensive team will be allotted one free throw and retain possession with this penalty in place. The defensive player who commits the foul will be assessed one common personal foul. Previously, the penalty was a common personal foul on the offending player in addition to a side out for the offensive team if they were not in the bonus.[122]\n* Following the death of 11-time champion Bill Russell, the NBA permanently retired the number 6 across the league, the first time a player's number has been retired across the league.[123] However, players who had the number 6 beforehand can keep their number unless they voluntarily change it or retire.[124]\n* The NBA honored Russell with a jersey patch.

This was the 183rd series sweep in NBA playoffs history.\n* Ja Morant scored 22 straight points for the Memphis Grizzlies in game 3 against the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the first player to score at least 22 straight points for their team in a playoff game since Kobe Bryant in 2010.\n* Jimmy Butler became the sixth player in NBA history to score 56 or more points in a playoff game, joining Michael Jordan (twice), Elgin Baylor, Donovan Mitchell, Charles Barkley, and Wilt Chamberlain.\n* Devin Booker became the third player since 1997 to score at least 25 points in a quarter in a playoff game, joining Damian Lillard (25 in 2019) and Allen Iverson (26 in 2001).\n* Devin Booker and Kevin Durant became the first duo in playoff history to each score 25+ points in each of their first six games of a postseason.\n* The New York Knicks won a playoff series for the first time since 2013.[1]\n* Giannis Antetokounmpo missed 13 free throws in game 5 against the Heat, marking the most free throw misses in a playoff game since DeAndre Jordan in 2015, and the most misses in any game (regular season or playoffs) since Ben Simmons in 2017.\n* The Heat became the first play–in team in NBA history to win a playoff series.\n* The eighth-seeded Heat defeated the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in five games, marking the sixth instance in NBA history of an 8th-seeded team defeating a 1st-seeded team in the first round, following previous instances in 1994, 1999, 2007, 2011, and 2012. Additionally, this was the fourth time such an upset occurred in a best-of-seven series, and the first to be completed in fewer than six games.\n* The seventh-seeded Lakers defeated the second-seeded Grizzlies in six games, marking the sixth instance in NBA history of a 7th-seeded team defeating a 2nd-seeded team in the first round, following previous instances in 1987, 1989, 1991, 1998, and 2010. Additionally, this was only the second time such an upset occurred in a best-of-seven series.\n* A seventh-seed (Lakers) and an eighth-seed (Heat) both advanced in the first round of the playoffs, marking the first time this happened since the 16-team format began in 1984. In all previous instances when a seventh or eighth seed advanced, only one or the other advanced (not both).\n* The Kings–Warriors series was the first of the 2023 playoffs to have a game 7, making it the 24th consecutive NBA postseason to feature a game 7. The last time a game 7 did not occur in the playoffs was 1999. This was the 148th game 7 in NBA playoffs history.\n* Stephen Curry's 50 points against the Kings was the first 50-point performance in a game 7 in NBA history.\n\n\n#### Conference semifinals[edit]\n\n\n* This was the first time in NBA history that every seed number from 1 through 8 made it to the second round across both conferences.\n* The sixth-seeded Warriors had home-court advantage in the western semifinals, becoming the lowest seed to have home-court advantage since the sixth-seeded Houston Rockets in 1987.\n* P. J. Tucker had zero field goal attempts and zero free throw attempts in 37 minutes played against the Boston Celtics, marking the most minutes played without a field goal or free throw attempt in a playoff game in the shot-clock era (since 1954–55).\n* Devin Booker's 35.9 points per game were the most through a player's first ten games of a postseason since Michael Jordan in 1990.\n* The Denver Nuggets' 81 first half points in game 6 against the Phoenix Suns were the most in a first half by an away team in postseason history.\n* Jalen Brunson became the fourth player in NBA history to make more field goals than the rest of the team combined in an elimination game, joining LeBron James (twice), Kobe Bryant, and Penny Hardaway.\n* With the defending champion Warriors losing to the Los Angeles Lakers, the 2023 playoffs marked the fourth straight year where the defending champion was eliminated before the conference finals.\n* The Warriors lost a playoff series to a Western Conference opponent for the first time since 2014, when the Los Angeles Clippers defeated them in seven games.\n* With the Lakers' series win over the Warriors, LeBron James earned his 41st career playoff series win, setting a new NBA record for the most career playoff series wins and surpassing Derek Fisher's previous record of 40.\n* Jayson Tatum's 51 points against the 76ers were the most in a game 7 in NBA history.\n\t+ Additionally, his 51 points and zero turnovers set a playoff record for the most points in a game without any turnovers.\n* There have been four 50-point games this postseason, the most in a single postseason.\n\n\n#### Conference finals[edit]\n\n\n* The Heat became the second eight-seeded team to reach the conference finals, joining the 1999 New York Knicks.[2]\n\t+ The Heat also became the first eight-seeded team to reach the conference finals in a full 82-game season, as the 1998–99 season was shortened due to a lockout.\n* The Lakers became the second seven-seeded team to reach the conference finals, joining the 1987 Seattle SuperSonics.[3]\n* All four teams in the conference finals from the 2020 Bubble returned to the 2023 conference finals.\n\t+ Like the aforementioned season, the Heat and Celtics have both beaten the Bucks and 76ers, respectively. The Heat also had beaten the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals.\n* The Heat became the fifth team to win the series opener on the road in each of their first three playoff series, joining the 1981 Houston Rockets, 1989 Chicago Bulls, 1999 New York Knicks, and 2021 Atlanta Hawks.\n* The Heat became the first eight-seeded team since the 1999 Knicks to go up 3–0 in a series.\n* The Heat became the first eight-seeded team to win a playoff game by more than 25 points.\n* This was the second instance (following the 2015 playoffs) where both conference finals series had teams go up 3–0 in the series.\n* Nikola Jokić recorded his eighth triple-double of the 2023 playoffs in game 4 against the Lakers, breaking the record held by Wilt Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles in a single postseason.\n* The Nuggets beat the Lakers 4–0 in the conference finals, marking their first playoff series sweep in franchise history.\n\t+ The Nuggets also became the last of the four teams from the American Basketball Association to reach the NBA Finals.\n* This marked the third time LeBron James was swept in a playoff series. The last two times he was swept were in the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs in 2007 and the Golden State Warriors in 2018.\n* Jokić became the second player to average a triple-double in multiple playoff series in a single postseason, joining Wilt Chamberlain in 1967.\n* The Celtics became the fourth team ever to force a game 7 after trailing 0–3 in a series, and the first team to do so since 2003.\n\t+ Additionally, the Celtics became the first team to host a game 7 after trailing 0–3.\n* Derrick White became the second player in NBA history to hit a buzzer-beater with his team trailing and facing elimination, joining Michael Jordan's \"The Shot\" in 1989.\n\t+ It was also the sixth game-winning buzzer-beater when facing elimination in NBA history, and the first since Kawhi Leonard in 2019. Coincidentally, Jimmy Butler has been on the losing side of three of those buzzer-beaters.\n* Jaylen Brown became the fifth player with 8+ turnovers in a game 7 since individual turnovers were tracked in 1978, joining Shawn Kemp, LeBron James, Donovan Mitchell, and Joel Embiid.\n\n\n#### NBA Finals[edit]\n\n\n* The Heat became the second eight-seeded team to reach the NBA Finals, joining the 1999 New York Knicks. Coincidentally, both the Knicks and the Heat beat each other during their respective run to the Finals.\n\t+ The Heat also became the first eight-seeded team to reach the Finals in a full 82-game season, as the 1998–99 season was shortened due to a lockout.\n\t+ For the first time, an NHL and NBA team from the same metro area made the final as the lowest seed in the same season. Ironically, both the Heat and the Florida Panthers would lose to the number 1 seed in the Western Conference in 5 games.\n* The Heat became the first team to make the NBA Finals after making the playoffs via the Play-In tournament.\n* The Heat became the third team in NBA history to finish last in PPG (points per game) during the regular season and reach the NBA Finals, joining the 1956 Fort Wayne Pistons and 1964 San Francisco Warriors.\n* In game 1, the Heat had two free throw attempts, breaking the NBA record for the fewest free throw attempts in a playoff game. The previous playoff record was three, by the New Jersey Nets in 1993 and the previous Finals record was five, by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983.[4]\n* The Heat collected their 13th win of the playoffs in game 2 against the Nuggets, breaking a tie with the 1999 Knicks for the most wins ever by a No. 8 seed in a single postseason.\n* In game 3, Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray became the first teammates to record a triple-double in the NBA Finals and the first teammates to both record 30-point triple-doubles in any game.[5]\n* Udonis Haslem, aged 42 years, 363 days, became the oldest player to play in the NBA Finals, coming off the bench in the last minute.\n* Nikola Jokić became the first player in NBA history to put up at least 500 points, 250 rebounds, and 150 assists in a single postseason run.\n* Nikola Jokić became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in points (600), rebounds (269), and assists (190) in a single postseason.\n* Nikola Jokić was the lowest-selected player to be named NBA Finals MVP. Jokić was selected 41st overall in the 2014 NBA draft.\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\nSee also: NBA playoffs § Format\n\nEight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.\n\n\nThe NBA Board of Governors adopted a format starting in 2021 to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[6]\n\n\nEach conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding. All rounds were a best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format with regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home-court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). For the NBA Finals, home-court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\n\n\n## Playoff qualifying[edit]\n\n\nOn March 14, 2023, the Milwaukee Bucks became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[7] While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[8]\n\n\n*Seeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 11–14.*\n\n\n\nFurther information: NBA play-in tournament § 2023\n\n### Eastern Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seed | Team | Record | Clinched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Play-in berth | Playoff berth | Division title | Best recordin conference | Best recordin NBA\n |\n| 1 | Milwaukee Bucks | 58–24 | — | March 14[7] | March 28[9] | April 5[10] | April 5[10] |\n| 2 | Boston Celtics | 57–25 | — | March 18[11] | April 5[12] | — | —\n |\n| 3 | Philadelphia 76ers | 54–28 | — | March 21[13] | — | — | —\n |\n| 4 | Cleveland Cavaliers | 51–31 | — | March 26[14] | — | — | —\n |\n| 5 | New York Knicks | 47–35 | — | April 2[15] | — | — | —\n |\n| 6 | Brooklyn Nets | 45–37 | — | April 7[16] | — | — | —\n |\n| 7 | Atlanta Hawks | 41–41 | April 5[17] | April 11[18] | — | — | —\n |\n| 8 | Miami Heat | 44–38 | April 7[19] | April 14[20] | April 6[21] | — | —\n |\n\n\nToronto (41–41) and Chicago (40–42) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.[22][20]\n\n\n\n### Western Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seed | Team | Record | Clinched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Play-in berth | Playoff berth | Division title | Best recordin conference | Best recordin NBA\n |\n| 1 | Denver Nuggets | 53–29 | — | March 16[23] | March 16[23] | April 5[24] | —\n |\n| 2 | Memphis Grizzlies | 51–31 | — | March 24[25] | March 22[25] | — | —\n |\n| 3 | Sacramento Kings | 48–34 | — | March 29[26] | April 4[27] | — | —\n |\n| 4 | Phoenix Suns | 45–37 | — | April 4[28] | — | — | —\n |\n| 5 | Los Angeles Clippers | 44–38 | — | April 9[29] | — | — | —\n |\n| 6 | Golden State Warriors | 44–38 | — | April 9[29] | — | — | —\n |\n| 7 | Los Angeles Lakers | 43–39 | April 9[29] | April 11[30] | — | — | —\n |\n| 8 | Minnesota Timberwolves | 42–40 | April 8[31] | April 14[32] | — | — | —\n |\n\n\nNew Orleans (42–40) and Oklahoma City (40–42) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.[33][32]\n\n\n\n## Bracket[edit]\n\n\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round.

Jimmy Butler led Miami with 35 points, while Bam Adebayo contributed 22 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. However, the Heat also suffered a setback, as they lost Tyler Herro to a broken hand in the second quarter. Miami had built a 68–55 halftime lead before Herro's departure and maintained their advantage by shooting an impressive 60% from beyond the arc, their highest percentage of the season. Khris Middleton stepped up for the Bucks, finishing with 33 points and nine rebounds, but Milwaukee shooting 24.4% from the three-point line hindered any chance at a comeback.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| NBA TV\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 19 9:00 pm (8:00 pm CDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 122, **Milwaukee Bucks** **138** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 28–**35**, 27–**46**, 30–**37**, **37**–20 |\n| **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 25**Rebs:** Cody Zeller 8**Asts:** Caleb Martin 6 |  | **Pts:** Brook Lopez 25**Rebs:** Bobby Portis 15**Asts:** Jrue Holiday 11 |\n| ***Series tied, 1–1*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Fiserv Forum, Milwaukee, WI**Attendance:** 17,576**Referees:** John Goble, Brian Forte, Tre Maddox\n |\n After shooting 11-of-45 from three-point range in their Game 1 loss, the Bucks shot 25-of-49 from beyond the arc, tying the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers for the most three-point makes by a team in a playoff game. Despite Giannis Antetokounmpo's absence, Milwaukee managed to dominate the Heat thanks to a team effort, as six Bucks players scored at least 16 points. Brook Lopez scored 25 points, Jrue Holiday added 24 points, and Pat Connaughton dropped a playoff career-high 22 points, shooting 6-of-10 from beyond the arc. Jimmy Butler scored 25 for Miami, but it wasn't enough to keep up with the hot shooting of the Bucks, as they led by as much as 36 points.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ESPN\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 22 7:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Milwaukee Bucks 99, **Miami Heat** **121** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 21–**29**, 32–**37**, 26–**28**, 20–**27** |\n| **Pts:** Khris Middleton 23**Rebs:** Bobby Portis 10**Asts:** Khris Middleton 6 |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 30**Rebs:** Adebayo, Martin 11 each**Asts:** Bam Adebayo 5 |\n| ***Miami leads series, 2–1*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Kaseya Center, Miami, FL**Attendance:** 19,734**Referees:** Eric Lewis, Kevin Scott, Rodney Mott\n |\n The No. 8 seeded Heat retook their series lead with a 121–99 victory over the shorthanded Bucks. Jimmy Butler led the way for Miami with 30 points in 28 minutes on 12-of-19 shooting. After Milwaukee went 10-of-18 (56%) from deep in the first half, they cooled off after halftime, shooting only 5-of-21 (24%) from three-point range in the second half. Khris Middleton scored 23 points, while Jrue Holiday added 19 and Grayson Allen scored 14. Meanwhile, Miami's Duncan Robinson scored 20 points on his 29th birthday, while Kyle Lowry added 15 points as the Heat led by as much as 29 points.

Butler, who scored 22 of Miami's 28 first quarter points, finished 19-of-28 from the field, 15-of-18 from the foul line, and added nine rebounds. His 56 points also set a franchise playoff record for the Heat. Brook Lopez was the leading scorer for the Bucks, with 36 points and 11 rebounds.

The Heat went on to win in overtime, becoming the sixth 8-seeded team to knock off a No. 1 seed and the first play-in team ever to win a playoff series. Butler, who averaged 37.6 points throughout the series, led Miami with 42 points, while Bam Adebayo dropped a 20-point triple-double.

Boston led the majority of the game thanks to a 14–4 run to start the game, with six Celtics players scoring in double figures. Although Philadelphia pulled within four points late in the final quarter, Boston hit timely three-pointers that prevented the 76ers from gaining any more ground. Despite Embiid's 30-point and 13-rebound performance on one good knee, James Harden and Tyrese Maxey's combined shooting of 7-for-30 (23%) left him with little offensive support.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ESPN\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 7 3:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 115, **Philadelphia 76ers** **116** (OT)\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 19–**27**, 31–**32**, 33–33, **24**–15, **Overtime:** 8–**9** |\n| **Pts:** Jayson Tatum 24**Rebs:** Jayson Tatum 18**Asts:** Marcus Smart 7 |  | **Pts:** James Harden 42**Rebs:** Joel Embiid 13**Asts:** James Harden 9 |\n| ***Series tied, 2–2*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia, PA**Attendance:** 21,264**Referees:** John Goble, James Williams, Gediminas Petraitis\n |\n After having the worst shooting stretch of his career over any two-game span in Games 2 and 3, James Harden bounced back in Game 4 by scoring 42 points on 16-of-23 shooting to help Philadelphia tie the series at two games apiece. After Boston rallied from a 16-point deficit to take a five-point lead with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, the 76ers responded with key baskets from Harden and P. J. Tucker, including a floater from Harden with 16 seconds left to force overtime. In overtime, Joel Embiid hit a pair of free-throws to give Philadelphia the lead, but Jayson Tatum hit a step-back three to put the Celtics ahead by two with less than a minute remaining. However, Harden answered back with his sixth three-pointer of the night, putting the 76ers back in front with 18 seconds to go. Although Marcus Smart had a chance to win it for Boston, his shot was ruled too late, securing the victory for Philadelphia.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 9 7:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Philadelphia 76ers** **115**, Boston Celtics 103\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **33**–26, **25**–23, **30**–23, 27–**31** |\n| **Pts:** Joel Embiid 33**Rebs:** Tobias Harris 11**Asts:** James Harden 10 |  | **Pts:** Jayson Tatum 36**Rebs:** Jayson Tatum 10**Asts:** Jayson Tatum 5 |\n| ***Philadelphia leads series, 3–2*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston, MA**Attendance:** 19,156**Referees:** Marc Davis, Josh Tiven, Tyler Ford\n |\n With a commanding performance on the road, the 76ers moved to the brink of their first conference finals berth in 22 years.

Tyrese Maxey also stepped up for the 76ers, contributing 30 points and six three-pointers, while James Harden had 17 points, ten assists, and eight rebounds on 50% shooting. Jayson Tatum scored 36 points for Boston, but he struggled to shoot efficiently, going 11-of-27 from the field.

However, he came alive during the final quarter, dropping 16 points and leading a crucial 14–1 run in the final five minutes to force a Game 7 back in Boston. Despite trailing by as much as 16 points in the first half, the 76ers rallied thanks to the efforts of Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, who helped the team take the lead entering the fourth quarter. However, Philadelphia faltered down the stretch, missing all eight of their three-point attempts in the fourth and failing to make a single field goal over the last six minutes until garbage time.

Meanwhile, the 76ers lost in the conference semifinals for the fifth time in six years, with MVP Joel Embiid scoring just 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting, while James Harden scored nine points on 3-of-11 shooting.

Love three-pointer that gave Miami a lead they would not relinquish. Jimmy Butler led the way for the Heat with 25 points and 11 rebounds before rolling his ankle in the fourth quarter. Butler got help from his teammates, however, as Gabe Vincent, Kyle Lowry, and Bam Adebayo each scored 15+ points as all three players made key plays down the stretch. The Heat's defense also held firm, as they limited New York to just 7-of-34 shooting from beyond the arc. The Knicks, who were without Julius Randle, were led by RJ Barrett and Jalen Brunson who scored 26 and 25 points, respectively.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 2 7:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 105, **New York Knicks** **111** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 29–**31**, **25**–20, 23–**25**, 28–**35** |\n| **Pts:** Caleb Martin 22**Rebs:** Adebayo, Martin 8 each**Asts:** Adebayo, Lowry 6 each |  | **Pts:** Jalen Brunson 30**Rebs:** Julius Randle 12**Asts:** Josh Hart 9 |\n| ***Series tied, 1–1*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Madison Square Garden, New York City, NY**Attendance:** 19,812**Referees:** Scott Foster, Curtis Blair, Mark Lindsay\n |\n After shooting 20% from deep in the series opener, New York bounced back, converting 40% of their three-point attempts as the Knicks evened up the series at one game apiece. Jalen Brunson atoned for his 0-for-7 three-point shooting in Game 1, as he shot 6-of-10 from beyond the arc, finishing with 30 points. Josh Hart finished an assist shy of a triple-double, as he scored ten of his 14 points in the final five minutes of the game. Julius Randle returned to the Knicks lineup and contributed 25 points and 12 rebounds, while RJ Barrett added 24 points. For the Heat, Caleb Martin stepped up in place of the injured Jimmy Butler, scoring 22 points, while Gabe Vincent and Max Strus combined for 38 points, all of whom were undrafted.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 6 3:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| New York Knicks 86, **Miami Heat** **105** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 21–**29**, 23–**29**, 26–**29**, 16–**18** |\n| **Pts:** Jalen Brunson 20**Rebs:** Julius Randle 14**Asts:** Jalen Brunson 8 |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 28**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 12**Asts:** *three players* 4 each[e] |\n| ***Miami leads series, 2–1*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Kaseya Center, Miami, FL**Attendance:** 19,927**Referees:** Marc Davis, Josh Tiven, Brian Forte\n |\n The Heat improved to 3–0 at home this postseason, putting them just two wins away from becoming the second eighth seed ever to advance to the conference finals. Miami started the game by setting the tone on both ends of the court, as they made ten of their first 15 shots, while the Knicks missed 13 of their first 17. Jimmy Butler, who returned from his one-game absence, scored 28 points, Max Strus added 19 points, and Bam Adebayo had a double-double for the Heat, who never trailed. Meanwhile, New York struggled to find their rhythm, as their top three scorers from the regular season (Jalen Brunson, Julius Randle, and RJ Barrett) shot a combined 16-of-51 (31%) from the field, including 2-of-17 (12%) from beyond the arc.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 8 7:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| New York Knicks 101, **Miami Heat** **109** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 30–**31**, 18–**25**, 33–**34**, **20**–19 |\n| **Pts:** Jalen Brunson 32**Rebs:** Julius Randle 9**Asts:** Jalen Brunson 11 |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 27**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 13**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 10 |\n| ***Miami leads series, 3–1*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Kaseya Center, Miami, FL**Attendance:** 19,769**Referees:** Zach Zarba, Courtney Kirkland, Ben Taylor\n |\n Led by Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, the Heat moved one win away from their third trip to the conference finals in four years. Butler finished with 27 points and ten assists, while Adebayo contributed 23 points and 13 rebounds as Miami became the fourth No. 8 seed to win at least seven playoff games. Although the Heat struggled in the fourth quarter, as they missed 12 of their first 15 shots, the Knicks failed to take full advantage. After New York gave up six offensive rebounds in the first three quarters, they gave up seven more in the fourth quarter alone. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 32 points and 11 assists, while RJ Barrett had 24 points and Julius Randle scored 20 before fouling out in the final minutes.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 10 7:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 103, **New York Knicks** **112** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **24**–14, 23–**36**, 27–**34**, **29**–28 |\n| **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 19**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 8**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 9 |  | **Pts:** Jalen Brunson 38**Rebs:** Mitchell Robinson 11**Asts:** Jalen Brunson 7 |\n| ***Miami leads series, 3–2*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Madison Square Garden, New York City, NY**Attendance:** 19,812**Referees:** John Goble, Eric Lewis, Karl Lane\n |\n Jalen Brunson played all 48 minutes and contributed 38 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists to help keep the Knicks' season alive.

Although the Knicks built a 19-point lead in the third quarter, the Heat cut it down to two with under three minutes remaining in the game. However, New York closed the game out on a 9–2 run to force a Game 6 in Miami. Jimmy Butler led the Heat with 19 points, as he was held below 25 points for the first time this postseason. Bam Adebayo and Duncan Robinson also contributed with 18 and 17 points respectively, but Miami struggled from deep, missing 21 of their first 25 three-pointers.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ESPN\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 12 7:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| New York Knicks 92, **Miami Heat** **96** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **31**–24, 19–**27**, 21–**23**, 21–**22** |\n| **Pts:** Jalen Brunson 41**Rebs:** Randle, Robinson 11 each**Asts:** *three players* 3 each[f] |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 24**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 9**Asts:** Kyle Lowry 9 |\n| ***Miami wins series, 4–2*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Kaseya Center, Miami, FL**Attendance:** 19,737**Referees:** Scott Foster, Kevin Scott, Tre Maddox\n |\n The Heat advanced to the conference finals for the seventh time in the last 13 years and became just the second No. 8 seed ever to reach the conference finals. Despite an early 14-point lead by the Knicks, Miami took the lead by halftime and held it throughout the second half. However, up by six with under a minute remaining, Gabe Vincent's flagrant foul on Jalen Brunson allowed New York to score four points in five seconds. After a Jimmy Butler miss, the Knicks had an opportunity to tie the game, but Kyle Lowry came up with a steal, and Butler made free throws with 14 seconds left to clinch the win for the Heat. Butler scored 24 points, Bam Adebayo added 23, and Lowry had nine assists. Meanwhile, Brunson scored 41 points, accounting for over half of the Knicks' 27 made field goals. But his teammates only scored 51 points, with Julius Randle and RJ Barrett combining for just 26 points on 4-of-24 shooting.\n\n\n\n\nRegular-season series\n| New York won 3–1 in the regular-season series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| February 2, 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 104, **New York Knicks** **106** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Madison Square Garden, New York City, NY\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| March 3, 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **New York Knicks** **122**, Miami Heat 120\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami-Dade Arena, Miami, FL\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| March 22, 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| New York Knicks 120, **Miami Heat** **127** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami-Dade Arena, Miami, FL\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| March 29, 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 92, **New York Knicks** **101** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Madison Square Garden, New York City, NY\n |\n |\n\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning three of the first five meetings.[43]\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious playoff series\n| New York leads 3–2 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 1997\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** **4**, New York Knicks 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1997 Eastern Conference semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1998\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 2, **New York Knicks** **3** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1998 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1999\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 2, **New York Knicks** **3** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1999 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2000\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 3, **New York Knicks** **4** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2000 Eastern Conference semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** **4**, New York Knicks 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n |\n\n\n### Western Conference semifinals[edit]\n\n\n#### (1) Denver Nuggets vs. (4) Phoenix Suns[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| April 29 8:30 pm (6:30 pm MDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Phoenix Suns 107, **Denver Nuggets** **125** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **32**–31, 19–**37**, **30**–26, 26–**31** |\n| **Pts:** Kevin Durant 29**Rebs:** Kevin Durant 14**Asts:** Devin Booker 8 |  | **Pts:** Jamal Murray 34**Rebs:** Nikola Jokić 19**Asts:** Jamal Murray 9 |\n| ***Denver leads series, 1–0*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Ball Arena, Denver, CO**Attendance:** 19,762**Referees:** Marc Davis, Josh Tiven, Tre Maddox\n |\n After missing their previous matchup in 2021 due to injury, Jamal Murray led the Nuggets' fast-paced offense with 34 points and six three-pointers as Denver snapped their seven-game playoff losing streak to the Suns.

In addition, Jayson Tatum scored 31 points, Jaylen Brown scored 26, and Marcus Smart added 21 for Boston, who became only the fourth team to erase a 0–3 deficit and force a decisive game 7. For the Heat, the duo of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo went 5-of-30 from the field in the first three quarters, combining for just 18 points. However, trailing by ten with under four minutes to go, Butler scored 13 of his 24 points during a 15–4 run that gave Miami the lead with three seconds left. After a Celtics timeout, White inbounded the ball to Smart, who missed a three-pointer, but White crashed the boards and scored the game-winning tip shot.\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TNT\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 29 8:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** **103**, Boston Celtics 84\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **22**–15, **30**–26, 24–**25**, **27**–18 |\n| **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 28**Rebs:** Adebayo, Martin 10 each**Asts:** Bam Adebayo 7 |  | **Pts:** Jaylen Brown 19**Rebs:** Jayson Tatum 11**Asts:** Jaylen Brown 5 |\n| ***Miami wins series, 4–3*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston, MA**Attendance:** 19,156**Referees:** Scott Foster, Tony Brothers, John Goble\n |\n Following their defeat in a decisive seventh game against the Celtics last year, the Heat overcame the setback of squandering a 3–0 series lead to secure their second NBA Finals appearance in four seasons. Caleb Martin, who averaged just 9.6 points in the regular season, scored a playoff career-high 26 points on 11-of-16 shooting, finishing the series averaging 19.3 points. Jimmy Butler scored a game-high 28 points, while Bam Adebayo recorded his seventh double-double of the playoffs as the Heat became the first No. 8 seed to reach the Finals in a full 82-game regular season. The Celtics meanwhile were discombobulated from the start, as they missed their first 12 three-point attempts and finished the game shooting 21% from deep. Derrick White scored 18 for Boston, and Jayson Tatum had 14 points with 11 rebounds after turning his ankle on the first play of the game. Jaylen Brown contributed 19 points and eight rebounds, but shot 1-of-9 from beyond the arc and committed a playoff-high eight turnovers as Boston lost their 12th playoff game at home over the last two postseasons.\n\n\nButler was awarded the second annual Eastern Conference finals MVP, averaging 24.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 6.1 assists on 42% from the field, 35% from beyond the arc, and 83% from the free-throw line.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular-season series\n| Tied 2–2 in the regular-season series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| October 21, 2022\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** **111**, Miami Heat 104\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| FTX Arena, Miami, FL\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| November 30, 2022\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 121, **Boston Celtics** **134** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston, MA\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| December 2, 2022\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** **120**, Boston Celtics 116 (OT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston, MA\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| January 24, 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 95, **Miami Heat** **98** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami-Dade Arena, Miami, FL\n |\n |\n\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Heat winning three of the first five meetings.[46]\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious playoffs series\n| Miami leads 3–2 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 2010\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Boston Celtics** 4, Miami Heat 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2010 Eastern Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2011\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** 4, Boston Celtics 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2011 Eastern Conference semifinals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** 4, Boston Celtics 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012 Eastern Conference finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2020\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 2, **Miami Heat** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2020 Eastern Conference finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2022\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 3, **Boston Celtics** 4\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2022 Eastern Conference finals\n |\n |\n\n\n### Western Conference finals[edit]\n\n\n#### (1) Denver Nuggets vs. (7) Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ESPN\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| May 16 8:30 pm (6:30 pm MDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Los Angeles Lakers 126, **Denver Nuggets** **132** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 25–**37**, 29–**35**, **38**–34, **34**–26 |\n| **Pts:** Anthony Davis 40**Rebs:** LeBron James 12**Asts:** LeBron James 9 |  | **Pts:** Nikola Jokić 34**Rebs:** Nikola Jokić 21**Asts:** Nikola Jokić 14 |\n| ***Denver leads series, 1–0*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Ball Arena, Denver, CO**Attendance:** 19,633**Referees:** Zach Zarba, Eric Lewis, Ben Taylor\n |\n Looking to advance to their first NBA Finals in their 47th season, the Nuggets got off on the right track, as Nikola Jokić recorded his sixth triple-double of the playoffs to propel Denver to a 1–0 series lead. Jokić notched 34 points, 21 rebounds, and 14 assists on 12-of-17 shooting as he outrebounded the Lakers by himself in the first half, 16 to 13. Jokić's performance was backed by his teammates, as five other Denver players finished in double figures, with Jamal Murray scoring 31 points on 60% shooting. For the Lakers, Anthony Davis finished with 40 points, while LeBron James put up 26 points, 12 boards, and nine assists. Los Angeles trailed by as many as 21 but they pulled within three points multiple times in the fourth quarter, with Austin Reaves scoring 11 of his 23 points in the final quarter.

Murray's performance fueled a pivotal 15–1 run that gave Denver a lead they would not relinquish. Nikola Jokić also recorded his 13th playoff triple-double, contributing 23 points, 17 rebounds, and 12 assists as Denver moved to 39–4 at home this season with Jokić on the floor. Meanwhile, Rui Hachimura shot 7-for-7 in the first half and finished with 21 points for the Lakers, while Austin Reaves scored 22 points.

Trailing by one with under eight minutes remaining, the Nuggets orchestrated a decisive 13–0 run, capitalizing on a disciplined team performance that yielded 30 assists to just five turnovers. Jamal Murray picked up where he left off in Game 2, as he scored 30 of his 37 points in the first half, while Nikola Jokić scored 15 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter. Anthony Davis led the Lakers with 28 points and 18 rebounds, LeBron James contributed 23 points and 12 assists, and Austin Reaves contributed 23 points and seven rebounds.

Denver faced a 15-point halftime deficit but opened the second half on a 36–14 run. Los Angeles tied the game in the closing minutes after erasing a seven-point deficit, but Nikola Jokić's 25-foot fallaway three-pointer and go-ahead layup sealed the Nuggets' first playoff series sweep in franchise history. Jokić broke an NBA playoff record with his eighth triple-double of the playoffs, recording 30 points, 14 rebounds, and 13 assists, while Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon contributed 25 and 22 points, respectively. LeBron James matched his playoff career-high as a Laker with 40 points, ten boards, and nine assists, as his 31 points in the first half marked the highest-scoring playoff half of his career. However, James missed critical shots, including a potential game-tying shot that was blocked by Gordon in the final seconds. Anthony Davis contributed 21 points and 14 rebounds, and Austin Reaves scored 17 points as the Lakers were swept for the 11th time in team history.\n\n\nJokić was awarded the second annual Western Conference finals MVP, averaging 27.8 points, 14.5 rebounds, and 11.8 assists on 51% from the field, 47% from beyond the arc, and 78% from the free-throw line.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular-season series\n| Tied 2–2 in the regular-season series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| October 26, 2022\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Los Angeles Lakers 99, **Denver Nuggets** **110** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Ball Arena, Denver, CO\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| October 30, 2022\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Denver Nuggets 110, **Los Angeles Lakers** **121** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Crypto.com Arena, Los Angeles, CA\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| December 16, 2022\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Denver Nuggets 108, **Los Angeles Lakers** **126** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Crypto.com Arena, Los Angeles, CA\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| January 9, 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Los Angeles Lakers 109, **Denver Nuggets** **122** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Ball Arena, Denver, CO\n |\n |\n\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first seven meetings.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious playoffs series\n| LA Lakers lead 7–0 in all-time playoff series\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| 1979\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Denver Nuggets 1, **Los Angeles Lakers** 2\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1979 Western Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1985\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** 4, Denver Nuggets 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1985 Western Conference finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1987\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** 3, Denver Nuggets 0\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1987 Western Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2008\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** 4, Denver Nuggets 0\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2008 Western Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2009\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** 4, Denver Nuggets 2\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2009 Western Conference finals\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** 4, Denver Nuggets 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2012 Western Conference First Round\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2020\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** 4, Denver Nuggets 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2020 Western Conference finals\n |\n |\n\n\n## NBA Finals: (W1) Denver Nuggets vs. (E8) Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 NBA Finals\n\n*Note: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by NBA.

Each team's regional broadcaster televised local coverage of first-round games, with the exception of weekend games on ABC.[h] In general during the first two rounds, ABC broadcast Sunday afternoon games, TNT aired Sunday through Wednesday night games, and ESPN televised Friday night games. For Thursday night games, TNT had them in the first round and ESPN in the second round. NBA TV also televised selected Tuesday through Thursday night first-round games. ABC also aired a Friday night first-round game, and ESPN televised a Sunday afternoon second-round game due to ABC's coverage of the Miami Grand Prix. Saturday first-round games were split, with ESPN airing five games, TNT two games, and ABC one game. TNT then aired the opening Saturday second-round game (in place of any potential first-round game 7's that were originally scheduled on that day). ABC aired the remaining Saturday second-round games. As per the alternating rotation, ESPN/ABC had exclusive coverage of the Western Conference finals while TNT had exclusive coverage of the Eastern Conference finals. ABC had exclusive coverage of the NBA Finals for the 21st straight year.[49][50] Select ESPN broadcasts received an alternate presentation similar to Manningcast, anchored by Stephen A. Smith on ESPN2 and streamed on ESPN+ as *NBA in Stephen A's World*.[51]\n\n\nNBA TV games were available on NBA League Pass as part of its normal streaming service for that channel.[52] Only selected ESPN/ABC games streamed live on ESPN+. For other games, live streams were only available for pay-TV subscribers via authenticated streaming on ESPN and TNT's respective apps.[51][53][54] In Canada, coverage was split between Sportsnet and TSN, with both simulcasting the U.S. national feed.\n\n\n\n### Most viewed playoff games[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Rank | Round | Date | Game | Away team | Score | Home team | Network | Viewers (millions) | TV rating\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | NBA Finals | June 12\n | Game 5\n | Heat | 89–94\n | **Nuggets** | ABC | 13.08[55] | 7.0\n |\n| 2\n | Eastern Conference Finals | May 29\n | Game 7\n | **Heat** | 103–84\n | Celtics | TNT | 12.00[56] | 5.8\n |\n| 3\n | NBA Finals | June 4\n | Game 2\n | **Heat** | 111–108\n | Nuggets | ABC | 11.91[57] | 6.0\n |\n| 4\n | NBA Finals | June 1\n | Game 1\n | Heat | 93–104\n | **Nuggets** | 11.58[58] | 6.0\n |\n| 5\n | NBA Finals | June 7\n | Game 3\n | **Nuggets** | 109–94\n | Heat | 11.24[59] | 6.0\n |\n| 6\n | NBA Finals | June 9\n | Game 4\n | **Nuggets** | 108–95\n | Heat | 10.41[60] | 5.4\n |\n| 7\n | Western Conference First Round | April 30\n | Game 7\n | **Warriors** | 120–100\n | Kings | 9.84[61] | 5.0\n |\n| 8\n | Eastern Conference Finals | May 27\n | Game 6\n | **Celtics** | 104–103\n | Heat | TNT | 8.71[56] | 4.0\n |\n| 9\n | Western Conference Semifinals | May 12\n | Game 6\n | Warriors | 101–122\n | **Lakers** | ESPN | 8.64[62] | 4.3\n |\n| 10\n | Eastern Conference Semifinals | May 14\n | Game 7\n | 76ers | 88–112\n | **Celtics** | ABC | 8.44[63] | 3.9\n |\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nFor the second straight year, the playoffs were officially known as the \"2023 NBA Playoffs presented by Google Pixel\".
