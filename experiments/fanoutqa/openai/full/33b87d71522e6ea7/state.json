At the time of writing, Alaska was not yet a state and had no senators, but Blish correctly assumed that this would come about by 2013.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Alaska portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* List of United States representatives from Alaska\n* United States congressional delegations from Alaska\n* Elections in Alaska\n* List of United States Senate elections in Alaska\n* Politics of Alaska\n* Political party strength in Alaska\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Alaska Senators, Representatives on GovTrack.us\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAlaska's current delegation to the United States Congress\n |\n| --- |\n| Senators | * \u258cLisa Murkowski (R)\n* \u258cDan Sullivan (R)\n |\n| Representative | * \u258cMary Peltola (D)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLists of United States congressional delegations\n |\n| --- |\n| States | * Alabama\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Alaska\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Arizona\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Arkansas\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* California\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Colorado\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Connecticut\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Delaware\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Florida\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Georgia\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Hawaii\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Idaho\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Illinois\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Indiana\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Iowa\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Kansas\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Kentucky\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Louisiana\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Maine\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Maryland\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Massachusetts\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Michigan\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Minnesota\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Mississippi\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Missouri\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Montana\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Nebraska\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Nevada\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* New Hampshire\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* New Jersey\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* New Mexico\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* New York\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* North Carolina\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* North Dakota\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Ohio\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Oklahoma\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Oregon\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Pennsylvania\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Rhode Island\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* South Carolina\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* South Dakota\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Tennessee\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Texas\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Utah\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Vermont\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Virginia\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Washington\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* West Virginia\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Wisconsin\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n* Wyoming\n\t+ H\n\t+ S\n |\n| Others | * American Samoa\n* District of Columbia\n* Guam\n* Northern Mariana Islands\n* Puerto Rico\n* U.S. Virgin Islands\n* Proposed (Cherokee)\n |\n| Obsolete | * Dakota Territory\n* Northwest Territory\n* Orleans Territory\n* Philippines\n* Southwest Territory\n |\n| * Lists of former House members\n* List of former senators\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUnited States senators from Alaska\n |\n| --- |\n| Class 2 | * Bartlett\n* Stevens\n* Begich\n* Sullivan\n | ![United States Senate](image)\n |\n| Class 3 | * Gruening\n* Gravel\n* F.

Seven people including only one Republican have served as a U.S. senator from Hawaii. The state's current U.S. senators are Democrats Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono. Hawaii's class 1 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by an ethnic minority.[*citation needed*] Its class 3 seat is the only one in the United States that has always been held by a member of the Democratic Party.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHawaii last elected a Republican in 1970, which has resulted in the longest streak in the nation for a state's having all-Democratic senators. Daniel K. Inouye was Hawaii's longest-serving senator, from 1963 to 2012.\n\n\n\n## List of senators[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  **Class 1**Class 1 U.S. senators belong to the electoral cycle that has recently been contested in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.

Its current U.S. senators are Democrats Ron Wyden (serving since 1996) and Jeff Merkley (serving since 2009). Mark Hatfield was the state's longest serving senator (1967\u20131997).\n\n\nPrior to 1906, U.S. senators were elected by the Oregon Legislative Assembly. In 1904, Oregon voters passed a ballot measure that required U.S. senators to be selected by a popular vote and then endorsed by the state legislature. Beginning in 1914, U.S. senators were directly elected by popular vote on the basis of the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution.[1][2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## List of senators[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  **Class 2**Class 2 U.S. senators belong to the electoral cycle that has recently been contested in 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2020.
