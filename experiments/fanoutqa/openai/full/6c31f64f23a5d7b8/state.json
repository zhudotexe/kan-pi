          "content": "<document>\n<title>Demographics of Uttar Pradesh</title>\n<content>\nThe **demographics of Uttar Pradesh** is a complex topic, which is undergoing dynamic change. Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state, and the largest subdivision in the world. It has a population of about 199,812,341[1] as per the 2011 census. If it were a separate country, Uttar Pradesh would be the world's fifth most populous nation, next only to China, India, the United States of America and Indonesia. Uttar Pradesh has a population more than that of Pakistan.[2] There is an average population density of 828 persons per km\u00b2 i.e. 2,146 per sq mi. The capital of Uttar Pradesh is Lucknow, and Prayagraj serves as the state\u2019s judicial capital. Hindus and Muslims both consider the state as a holy place.\n\n\nThe peripheral regions of Uttar Pradesh, are home to a number of tribal communities such as Agaria, Baiga, Bhar, Bhoksa, Bind, Chero, Gond, Kol and Korwa. Five of these tribal communities have been recognised by the Government of India as disadvantaged scheduled tribes, viz. Tharus, Boksas, Bhotias, Jaunswaris and Rajis.[3] The Literacy rate of the state according to the 2011 Census is 70.69%. With the literacy rate for Males at 79.20%, while it is 59.30% for the Females. While this is still below the national average of 74.04% (82.14% for men, 65.16% for women) the rate of growth has been much higher in Uttar Pradesh as compared to the rest of India.\n\n\n\n\n## District[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2011 census, Prayagraj is the most populous district of Uttar Pradesh while Mahoba being the least populated. Only 3 districts of Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Deoria have a sex ratio greater than 1000 while Gautam Buddha Nagar stands lowest in the tally with a very low ratio of 851. On the contrary, Gautam Buddha Nagar scores highest in literacy rate at 80.12% and Kanpur Nagar 2nd at 79.54%, while both being the poorest districts in terms of sex-ratio, depicting a negative-correlation among literacy and sex-ratio in this case. Districts of Srawasti, Bahraich and Balrampur haven't even crossed the 50% literacy mark yet.\n\n\nThe following table enumerates population, sex-ratio and literacy rates for each district of Uttar Pradesh:\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict-wise demographics of Uttar Pradesh (2011 Census)[4]\n| District | Population | Sex ratio | Literacy\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | Male | Female | Total | Male

Other Backward Classes (OBCs) constitute 40% of Uttar Pradesh\u2019s population.[17][18][19][20] Yadavs form the single largest group amongst the OBCs, constituting around 40 percent, and forming almost 15 percent of the state's population.[21] There are 200-odd OBCs in U.P. In Uttar Pradesh, Muslims are divided into 68 castes and sub-castes, 35 of them are OBCs. Forward castes constitute around 18-20% of Uttar Pradesh population,[22][23] in which Brahmins are about 9%[24][25] and Rajputs are 8%.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Castes of Uttar Pradesh[26][27][28][29][30] |\n| --- |\n| Caste | Population (%)\n |\n| OBC | 40%\n |\n| Dalits (SCs)\n | 20-21%\n |\n| Tribals (STs)\n | 0.1%\n |\n| Forward caste | 18-20%\n |\n| Muslims\n | 19-20%\n |\n| Others\n | 0.9%\n |\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nUttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India with a population of over 199.5 million people on 1 March 2011. It is more populated than the world's 242 countries. If independent it would be the 6th largest country in the world as per Population.\n\n\nAt the 2011 census of India, 79.7% of Uttar Pradesh population is Hindu. Muslims make up 19.3% of the population, most of whom are Rohillas, a clan of ethnic Pathans. The remaining population consists of Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians and Jains.\n\n\nThe population of Uttar Pradesh is divided into numerous castes and sub-castes. Historically, Hindu society is divided into four sub-divisions or varnas, the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. Muslims are also divided as the Shias and Sunnis. In actual practice, Hindu society in generally used to be divided into numerous lineage groups called jatis. Each jati is then sub-divided into clans, called gotras.\n\n\nThe peripheral regions of Uttar Pradesh, are home to a number of tribal communities such as Agaria, Baiga, Bhar, Bhoksa, Chero, Gond, Kol and Korwa. Five of these tribal communities have been recognised by the Government of India as disadvantaged scheduled tribes, viz. Tharus, Boksas, Bhotias, Jaunswaris and Rajis.[3]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMost people in Uttar Pradesh speak Hindi (including Urdu, which is often considered the same language), followed by Awadhi and Bhojpuri.[31]\n\n\nThe dialect map of Uttar Pradesh is complex, but, in general, in three of the five sub regions of UP, viz, the Doab, Rohilkhand, and Bundelkhand, both Western and Eastern Hindi, as well as a mixture of the two are spoken. E.g., in Upper and parts of lower Doab (till Etawah), various forms of western Hindi are spoken, including Khari boli and Brij Bhasha. In the rest of lower Doab, various mixes of western and Eastern Hindi (Brij Bhasha/ Bundelkhandi and Awadhi) are spoken). Likewise, in Western Bundelkhand, Bundeli (a language closely related with Brij Bhasha) is spoken, while in Eastern Bundelkhand the dialect is still called 'Bundeli' but is part of Eastern Hindi (actually a mixture of Western and Eastern Hindi). In Western Rohilkhand, Khari boli is spoken. in Central Rohilkhand a mix of Awadhi and Khari boli is spoken, while in Eastern Rohilkhand, Awadhi is the dialect.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, often these dialects merge into each other, for example in Shahjahanpur, in Rohilkhand, Khari boli merges into Awadhi.[32]\n\n\nIn central-eastern Uttar Pradesh, the Awadhi language is widely spoken. With about 38 million speakers, it is the second most spoken language in Uttar Pradesh according to independent sources.[33][34][35][36] However, in the official figures provided by the Indian census, the figure falls to an meagre four million due to conflation with neighbouring Hindi.\n\n\nIn extreme eastern Uttar Pradesh, the Bhojpuri language is spoken.[37] It is the third most widely spoken language of Uttar Pradesh after Hindi and Awadhi.[31] It belongs to the Magadhan group of Indo-Aryan languages.[38] This region is known as Bhojpur or Purvanchal.[39] The Bhojpuri variant of Kaithi is the indigenous script of Bhojpuri language.[40]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Uttar Pradesh: mother-tongue of population, according to the 2011 Census.[41] |\n| --- |\n| Mother tongue code\n | Mother tongue\n | People\n | Percentage\n |\n| 001002 | Assamese | 10,288\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 002007 | Bengali | 240,966\n | 0.12%\n |\n| 005018 | Gujarati | 11,938\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 006030 | Awadhi | 3,801,743\n | 1.90%\n |\n| 006102 | Bhojpuri | 21,844,783\n | 10.93%\n |\n| 006123 | Brajbhasha | 713,572\n | 0.36%\n |\n| 006125 | Bundeli/Bundel khandi | 1,303,940\n | 0.65%\n |\n| 006142 | Chhattisgarhi | 12,308\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 006195 | Garhwali | 22,914\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 006235 | Haryanvi | 16,166\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 006240 | Hindi | 160,159,977\n | 80.16%\n |\n| 006311 | Khari Boli (Kauravi) | 16,355\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 006340 | Kumauni | 11,059\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 006489 | Rajasthani | 13,382\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 010008 | Maithili | 16,989\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 011016 | Malayalam | 24,338\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 013071 | Marathi | 24,115\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 014011 | Nepali | 18,734\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 015043 | Odia | 24,071\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 016038 | Punjabi | 508,599\n | 0.25%\n |\n| 019014 | Sindhi | 28,937\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 020027 | Tamil | 14,426\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 021046 | Telugu | 13,918\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 022015 | Urdu | 10,793,391\n | 5.40%\n |\n| 022016 | Bhansari\n | 20,993\n | 0.01%\n |\n| 040001 | English | 13,085\n | 0.01%\n |\n| N.A. | Others | 131,354\n | 0.07%\n |\n| Total\n | 199,812,341\n | 100.00%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Distribution of Scheduled Castes by District in Uttar Pradesh\n* List of Rajput clans of Uttar Pradesh\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** ORGI. \"Census of India Website\u00a0: Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India\". *www.censusindia.gov.in*.

It is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the south, Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.[16] Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India and the third-most populous country subdivision globally.\n\n\nThe state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts, with the state capital being Mumbai, the most populous urban area in India, and Nagpur serving as the winter capital.[17] The Godavari and Krishna are the two major rivers in the state and forests cover 16.47 per cent of the state's geographical area. The state is home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ajanta Caves, Ellora Caves, Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus), The Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai and The Western Ghats, a heritage site made up of 39 individual properties of which 4 are in Maharashtra.[18][19] The State is the single largest contributor to India's economy with a share of 14 per cent in all-India nominal GDP.[20][21][22] The economy of Maharashtra is the largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of \u20b935.27 trillion (US$420\u00a0billion) and GSDP per capita of \u20b9242,247 (US$2,900).[7] The service sector dominates the state's economy, accounting for 69.3 per cent of the value of the output of the country. Although agriculture accounts for 12 per cent of the state GDP, it employs nearly half the population of the state.\n\n\nMaharashtra is one of the most industrialised states in India. The state's capital, Mumbai, is India's financial and commercial capital.[23] India's largest stock exchange Bombay Stock Exchange, the oldest in Asia, is located in the city, as is National Stock Exchange, which is the second largest stock exchange in India and one of world's largest derivatives exchanges. The state has played a significant role in the country's social and political life and is widely considered a leader in terms of agricultural and industrial production, trade and transport, and education.[24] Maharashtra is the ninth-highest ranking among Indian states in the human development index.[25]\n\n\nThe region that encompasses the state has a history going back many millennia. Notable dynasties that ruled the region include the Asmakas, the Mauryas, the Satavahanas, the Western Satraps, the Abhiras, the Vakatakas, the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Western Chalukyas, the Seuna Yadavas, the Khaljis, the Tughlaqs, the Bahamanis and the Mughals. In the early nineteenth century, the region was divided beween the Dominions of the Peshwa in the Maratha Confederacy and the Nizamate of Hyderabad. After two wars and the proclamation of the Indian Empire, the region became a part of the Bombay Province, the Berar Province and the Central Provinces of India under direct British rule and the Deccan States Agency under Crown suzerainty. Between 1950 and 1956, the Bombay Province became the Bombay State in the Indian Union, and Berar, the Deccan states and the Gujarat states were merged into the Bombay State. On 1 May 1960, the State of Bombay was bifurcated into the State of Maharasthra and State of Gujarat after a long struggle for special state for Marathi language speaking people through Samyukta Maharashtra Movement (transl.\u2009United Maharashtra movement).\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe modern Marathi language evolved from the Maharashtri Prakrit,[26] and the word *Marhatta* (later used for the Marathas) is found in the Jain Maharashtrian literature. The term Maharashtra (Marathi: \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930) along with Maharashtrian, Marathi, and Maratha may have derived from the same root. However, their exact etymology is uncertain.[27]\n\n\nThe most widely accepted theory among the linguistic scholars is that the words Maratha and Maharashtra ultimately derived from a combination of *Mah\u0101* (Marathi: \u092e\u0939\u093e) and *R\u0101shtrik\u0101* (Marathi: \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e),[27][28] the name of a tribe or dynasty of chiefs ruling in the Deccan region.[29] An alternate theory states that the term is derived from *mah\u0101* (\"great\") and *ratha*/*rathi* (\"chariot\"/\"charioteer\"), which refers to a skilful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the area.[29][28]\n\n\nAn alternative theory states that the term derives from the word *mah\u0101* (\"great\") and *r\u0101shtra* (\"nation/dominion\").[30] However, this theory is somewhat controversial among modern scholars who believe it to be the Sanskritised interpretation of later writers.[27]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Maharashtra, Maratha Empire, and Samyukta Maharashtra Movement\n\nSee also: Chronology of statehood of Maharashtra\n\n![](image)Late Harappa figure from Daimabad hoard, Indus Valley civilisation\n![](image)2nd century BCE Karla Caves are a group of Buddhist caves near Lonavala.\nNumerous Late Harappan or Chalcolithic sites belonging to the Jorwe culture (c.\u20091300\u2013700 BCE) have been discovered throughout the state.[31][32] The largest settlement discovered of the culture is at Daimabad, which had a mud fortification during this period, as well as an elliptical temple with fire pits.[33][34] In the Late Harappan period there was a large migration of people from Gujarat to northern Maharashtra.[35]\n\n\nMaharashtra was ruled by Maurya Empire in the fourth and third centuries BCE. Around 230 BCE, Maharashtra came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty which ruled it for the next 400 years.[36] The rule of Satavahana dynasty was followed by that of Western Satraps, Gupta Empire, Gurjara-Pratihara, Vakataka, Kadambas, Chalukya Empire, Rashtrakuta Dynasty, and Western Chalukya and the Yadava Dynasty. The Buddhist Ajanta Caves in present-day Aurangabad display influences from the Satavahana and Vakataka styles. The caves were possibly excavated during this period.[37]\n\n\nThe Chalukya dynasty ruled the region from the sixth to the eighth centuries CE, and the two prominent rulers were Pulakeshin II, who defeated the north Indian Emperor Harsha, and Vikramaditya II, who defeated the Arab invaders in the eighth century. The Rashtrakuta dynasty ruled Maharashtra from the eighth to the tenth century.[38] The Arab traveller Sulaiman al Mahri described the ruler of the Rashtrakuta dynasty Amoghavarsha as \"one of the four great kings of the world\".[39] Shilahara dynasty began as vassals of the Rashtrakuta dynasty which ruled the Deccan plateau between the eighth and tenth centuries. From the early 11th century to the 12th century, the Deccan Plateau, which includes a significant part of Maharashtra, was dominated by the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty.[40] Several battles were fought between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty in the Deccan Plateau during the reigns of Raja Raja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I, Jayasimha II, Someshvara I, and Vikramaditya VI.[41]\n\n\nIn the early 14th century, the Yadava dynasty, which ruled most of present-day Maharashtra, was overthrown by the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji. Later, Muhammad bin Tughluq conquered parts of the Deccan, and temporarily shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad in Maharashtra. After the collapse of the Tughluqs in 1347, the local Bahmani Sultanate of Gulbarga took over, governing the region for the next 150 years.[42] After the break-up of the Bahamani sultanate in 1518, Maharashtra split into five Deccan Sultanates: Nizamshah of Ahmednagar, Adilshah of Bijapur, Qutubshah of Golkonda, Bidarshah of Bidar and Imadshah of Elichpur. These kingdoms often fought with each other. United, they decisively defeated the Vijayanagara Empire of the south in 1565.[43] The present area of Mumbai was ruled by the Sultanate of Gujarat before its capture by Portugal in 1535 and the Faruqi dynasty ruled the Khandesh region between 1382 and 1601 before finally getting annexed in the Mughal Empire. Malik Ambar, the regent of the Nizamshahi dynasty of Ahmednagar from 1607 to 1626,[44] increased the strength and power of Murtaza Nizam Shah II and raised a large army.Ambar is said to have introduced the concept of guerrilla warfare in the Deccan region.[45] Malik Ambar assisted Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in Delhi against his stepmother, Nur Jahan, who wanted to enthrone her son-in-law.[46][47] Both Shivaji's grandfather, Maloji and father Shahaji served under Ambar.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bibi Ka Maqbara, a replica of the Taj Mahal, was built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb\n![](image)Statue of Shivaji opposite Gateway of India in South Mumbai\nIn the early 17th century, Shahaji Bhosale, an ambitious local general who had served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Mughals and Adil Shah of Bijapur at different periods throughout his career, attempted to establish his independent rule.[49] This attempt was unsuccessful, but his son Shivaji succeeded in establishing the Maratha Empire.[50] Shortly after Shivaji's death in 1680, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb launched a campaign to conquer Maratha territories as well as the Adilshahi and Govalkonda kingdoms.[51] This campaign, better known as Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars, was a strategic defeat for Mughals. Aurangzeb failed to fully conquer Maratha territories, and this campaign had a ruinous effect on Mughal Treasury and Army.[52] Shortly after Aurangzeb's death in 1707, Marathas under Peshwa Bajirao I and the generals that he had promoted such as Ranoji Shinde and Malharrao Holkar started conquering Mughal Territories in the north and western India, and by 1750s they or their successors had confined the Mughals to city of Delhi. [53].In the east the Bhonsale family of Nagpur expanded Maratha control all the way to Bengal.[54][55][56][57] [a]At its peak, the Maratha empire covered much of the subcontinent, encompassing a territory of over 2.8\u00a0million km2. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending the Mughal rule in India.[51][59][60]\n[61]\n\n\nAfter their defeat at the hand of Ahmad Shah Abdali's Afghan forces in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Maratha suffered a setback. However, they soon reclaimed the lost territories and ruled central and north India including Delhi until the end of the eighteenth century. The Marathas also developed a potent *Navy* circa in the 1660s, which at its peak under the command of Kanhoji Angre, dominated the territorial waters of the western coast of India from Mumbai to Savantwadi.[62] It resisted the British, Portuguese, Dutch, and Siddi naval ships and kept a check on their naval ambitions. \u2009Charles Metcalfe, British Civil servant and later Acting Governor-General, said in 1806 [63]\n\n\n\n\n> India contains no more than two great powers, British and Maratha, and every other state acknowledges the influence of one or the other. Every inch that we recede will be occupied by them.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe British East India Company slowly expanded areas under its rule during the 18th century. The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817\u20131818) led to the end of the Maratha Empire and the East India Company took over the empire.[64][65] The Maratha Navy dominated till around the 1730s, was in a state of decline by the 1770s and ceased to exist by 1818.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bombay-Poona Mail Train of the GIPR company in 1907\nThe British governed western Maharashtra as part of the Bombay Presidency, which spanned an area from Karachi in Pakistan to northern Deccan. A number of the Maratha states persisted as princely states, retaining autonomy in return for acknowledging British suzerainty. The largest princely states in the territory were Nagpur, Satara and Kolhapur State; Satara was annexed to the Bombay Presidency in 1848, and Nagpur was annexed in 1853 to become Nagpur Province, later part of the Central Provinces. Berar, which had been part of the Nizam of Hyderabad's kingdom, was occupied by the British in 1853 and annexed to the Central Provinces in 1903.[67] However, a large region called Marathwada remained part of the Nizam's Hyderabad State throughout the British period. The British ruled Maharashtra region from 1818 to 1947 and influenced every aspect of life for the people of the region. They brought several changes to the legal system,[68][69][70] built modern means of transport including roads[71] and Railways,[72][73] took various steps to provide mass education, including that for previously marginalised classes and women,[74] established universities based on western system and imparting education in science, technology,[75] and western medicine,[76][77][78] standardised the Marathi language,[79][80][81][82] and introduced mass media by utilising modern printing technologies.[83] The 1857 war of independence had many Marathi leaders, though the battles mainly took place in northern India. The modern struggle for independence started taking shape in the late 1800s with leaders such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Pherozeshah Mehta and Dadabhai Naoroji evaluating the company rule and its consequences. Jyotirao Phule was the pioneer of social reform in the Maharashtra region in the second half of the 19th century. His social work was continued by Shahu, Raja of Kolhapur and later by B. R. Ambedkar. After the partial autonomy given to the states by the Government of India Act 1935, B. G. Kher became the first Chief Minister of the Congress party-led Government of tri-lingual Bombay Presidency.[84] The ultimatum to the British during the Quit India Movement was given in Mumbai and culminated in the transfer of power and independence in 1947.\n\n\nAfter Indian independence, princely states and Jagirs of the Deccan States Agency were merged into Bombay State, which was created from the former Bombay Presidency in 1950.[85] In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganised the Indian states along linguistic lines, and Bombay Presidency State was enlarged by the addition of the predominantly Marathi-speaking regions of Marathwada (Aurangabad Division) from erstwhile Hyderabad state and Vidarbha region from the Central Provinces and Berar. The southernmost part of Bombay State was ceded to Mysore. In the 1950s, Marathi people strongly protested against bilingual Bombay state under the banner of Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti.[86][87] The notable leaders of the samiti included Keshavrao Jedhe, S.M. Joshi, Shripad Amrit Dange, Pralhad Keshav Atre and Gopalrao Khedkar. The key demand of the samiti called for a Marathi speaking state with Mumbai as its capital.[88] In the Gujarati speaking areas of the state, a similar Mahagujarat Movement demanded a separate Gujarat state comprising majority Gujarati areas. After many years of protests, which saw 106 deaths amongst the protestors, and electoral success of the samiti in 1957 elections, the central government led by Prime minister Nehru split Bombay State into two new states of Maharashtra and Gujarat on 1 May 1960.[89]\n\n\nThe state continues to have a dispute with Karnataka regarding the region of Belgaum and Karwar.[90][91] The Government of Maharashtra was unhappy with the border demarcation of 1957 and filed a petition to the Ministry of Home affairs of India.[92] Maharashtra claimed 814 villages, and 3 urban settlements of Belagon, Karwar and Nippani, all part of then Bombay Presidency before freedom of the country.[93] A petition by Maharashtra in the Supreme Court of India, staking a claim over Belagon, is currently pending.[94]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Belagavi border dispute\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Maharashtra\n\n![](image)\nBramhagiri hills in Sahyadri mountain range (Western Ghats)\n![](image)\nWainganga River near Bhandara district\n\nMaharashtra with a total area of 307,713\u00a0km2 (118,809\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), is the third-largest state by area in terms of land area and constitutes 9.36 per cent of India's total geographical area. The State lies between 15\u00b035' N to 22\u00b002' N latitude and 72\u00b036' E to 80\u00b054' E longitude. It occupies the western and central part of the country and has a coastline stretching 840 kilometres[95] along the Arabian Sea.[96] The dominant physical feature of the state is its plateau character, which is separated from the Konkan coastline by the mountain range of the Western Ghats, which runs parallel to the coast from north to south. The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri Range, has an average elevation of 1,200 metres (4,000\u00a0ft); its slopes gently descending towards the east and southeast.[97] The Western Ghats (or the Sahyadri Mountain range) provide a physical barrier to the state on the west, while the Satpura Hills along the north and Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri ranges on the east serve as its natural borders.[98] This state's expansion from North to South is 720\u00a0km and East to West is 800\u00a0km. To the west of these hills lie the Konkan coastal plains, 50\u201380 kilometres in width. To the east of the Ghats lies the flat Deccan Plateau. The main rivers of the state are the Krishna, and its tributary, Bhima, the Godavari, and its main tributaries, Manjara, and Wardha-Wainganga and the Tapi, and its tributary Purna.[96][99] Maharashtra is divided into five geographic regions. Konkan is the western coastal region, between the Western Ghats and the sea.[100] Khandesh is the north region lying in the valley of the Tapti, Purna river.[99] Nashik, Malegaon Jalgaon, Dhule and Bhusawal are the major cities of this region.[101] Desh is in the centre of the state.[102] Marathwada, which was a part of the princely state of Hyderabad until 1956, is located in the southeastern part of the state.[96][103] Aurangabad and Nanded are the main cities of the region.[104] Vidarbha is the easternmost region of the state, formerly part of the Central Provinces and Berar.[105]\n\n\nThe state has limited area under irrigation, low natural fertility of soils, and large areas prone to recurrent drought. Due to this the agricultural productivity of Maharashtra is generally low as compared to the national averages of various crops. Maharashtra has been divided in to nine agro-climatic zones on the basis of annual rainfall soil types, vegetation and cropping pattern.[106]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Manas Rural Development Institute\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dried up Godavari River at Puntamba, Ahmadnagar district, after a poor monsoon season\nMaharashtra experiences a tropical wet and dry climate with hot, rainy, and cold weather seasons.[107] The month of March marks the beginning of the summer and the temperature rises steadily until June. In the central plains, summer temperatures rise to between 40\u00a0\u00b0C or 104.0\u00a0\u00b0F and 45\u00a0\u00b0C or 113.0\u00a0\u00b0F. May is usually the warmest and January the coldest month of the year. The winter season lasts until February with lower temperatures occurring in December and January. On the Deccan plateau that lies on eastern side of the Sahyadri mountains, the climate is drier, however, dew and hail often occur, depending on seasonal weather.[108]\n\n\nThe rainfall patterns in the state vary by the topography of different regions. The state can be divided into four meteorological regions, namely coastal Konkan, Western Maharashtra, Marathwada, and Vidarbha.[109] The southwest monsoon usually arrives in the last week of June and lasts till mid-September. Pre-monsoon showers begin towards the middle of June and post-monsoon rains occasionally occur in October. The highest average monthly rainfall is during July and August. In the winter season, there may be a little rainfall associated with western winds over the region. The Konkan coastal area, west of the Sahyadri Mountains receives very heavy monsoon rains with an annual average of more than 3,000\u00a0mm. However, just 150\u00a0km to the east, in the rain shadow of the mountain range, only 500\u2013700\u00a0mm/year will fall, and long dry spells leading to drought are a common occurrence. Maharashtra has many of the 99 Indian districts identified by the Indian Central water commission as prone to drought.[110] The average annual rainfall in the state is 1,181\u00a0mm and 75 per cent of it is received during the southwest monsoon from June\u2013to September. However, under the influence of the Bay of Bengal, eastern Vidarbha receives good rainfall in July, August, and September.[111] Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg districts receive heavy rains of an average of 2,000 to 2,500\u00a0mm or 80 to 100\u00a0in and the hill stations of Matheran and Mahabaleshwar over 5,000\u00a0mm or 200\u00a0in. Contrariwise, the rain shadow districts of Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Jalgaon, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, and parts of Kolhapur receive less than 1,000\u00a0mm or 40\u00a0in annually. In winter, a cool dry spell occurs, with clear skies, gentle air breeze, and pleasant weather that prevails from October to February, although the eastern Vidarbha region receives rainfall from the north-east monsoon.[112]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Bengal tiger in Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve\nThe state has three crucial biogeographic zones, namely Western Ghats, Deccan Plateau, and the West coast. The Ghats nurture endemic species, Deccan Plateau provides for vast mountain ranges and grasslands while the coast is home to littoral and swamp forests. Flora of Maharashtra is heterogeneous in composition. In 2012 the recorded thick forest area in the state was 61,939\u00a0km2 (23,915\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) which was about 20.13 per cent of the state's geographical area.[113] There are three main Public Forestry Institutions (PFIs) in the Maharashtra state: the Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD), the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) and the Directorate of Social Forestry (SFD).[114] The Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board, constituted by the Government of Maharashtra in January 2012 under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is the nodal body for the conservation of biodiversity within and outside forest areas in the State.[115][116]\n\n\nMaharashtra is ranked second among the Indian states in terms of the recorded forest area. Recorded Forest Area (RFA) in the state is 61,579\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (159,489\u00a0km2) of which 49,546\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (128,324\u00a0km2) is reserved forests, 6,733\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (17,438\u00a0km2) is protected forest and 5,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (13,727\u00a0km2) is unclassed forests. Based on the interpretation of IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS III satellite data of the period Oct 2017 to Jan 2018, the State has 8,720.53\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (22,586\u00a0km2) under Very Dense Forest(VDF), 20,572.35\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (53,282\u00a0km2) under Moderately Dense Forest (MDF) and 21,484.68\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (55,645\u00a0km2) under Open Forest (OF). According to the Champion and Seth classification, Maharashtra has five types of forests:[117]\n\n\n\n* Southern Tropical Semi-Evergreen forests - These are found in the western ghats at a height of 400\u20131000 meters. Anjani, Hirda, Kinjal, and Mango are predominant tree species found here.\n* Southern Tropical Moist Deciduous forests-These are a mix of Moist Teak bearing forests (Melghat) and Moist Mixed deciduous forests (Vidarbha and Thane district). Commercially important Teak, Shishum, and bamboo are found here. In addition to evergreen Teak, some of the other tree species found in this type of forest include Jambul, Ain, and Shisam.[118]\n* Southern Tropical Dry Deciduous forests-these occupy a major part of the state. Southern Tropical Thorn forests are found in the low rainfall regions of Marathwada, Vidarbha, Khandesh, and Western Maharashtra. At present, these forests are heavily degraded. Babul, Bor, and Palas are some of the tree species found here.\n* Littoral and Swamp forests are mainly found in the Creeks of Sindhudurg and Thane districts of the coastal Konkan region. The state harbours significant mangrove, coastal and marine biodiversity, with 304\u00a0km2 (117\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the area under mangrove cover as per the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) of the Forest survey India in the coastal districts of the state.\n\n\nThe most common animal species present in the state are monkeys, wild pigs, tiger, leopard, gaur, sloth bear, sambar, four-horned antelope, chital, barking deer, mouse deer, small Indian civet, golden jackal, jungle cat, and hare.[119] Other animals found in this state include reptiles such as lizards, scorpions and snake species such as cobras and kraits.[120] The state provides legal protection to its tiger population through six dedicated tiger reserves under the precincts of the National Tiger Conservation Authority.\n\n\nThe state's 720 kilometres of sea coastline of the Arabian sea marks the presence of various types of fish and marine animals. The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) found 1527 marine animal species, including molluscs with 581 species, many crustacean species including crabs, shrimps, and lobsters, 289 fish species, and 141 species types of annelids (sea worms).[121]\n\n\n\n## Regions, divisions and districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Maharashtra\nSee also: Talukas of Maharashtra and List of cities in Maharashtra by population\n\n![refer caption](image)Divisions of Maharashtra, along with their respective districts (with Palghar district formed in 2014 from the northern part of Thane district)\nMaharashtra has following geographical regions:\n\n\n\n1. North Maharashtra\n2. Konkan\n3. Marathwada\n4. Vidarbha\n5. \n6. Desh or Western Maharashtra\n\n\nIt consists of six administrative divisions:[122]\n\n\n\n1. Amravati\n2. Aurangabad\n3. Konkan\n4. Nagpur\n5. Nashik\n6. Pune\n\n\nThe state's six divisions are further divided into 36 districts, 109 sub-divisions, and 358 talukas.[123] Maharashtra's top five districts by population, as ranked by the 2011 Census, are listed in the following table.\n\n\nEach district is governed by a district collector or district magistrate, appointed either by the Indian Administrative Service or the Maharashtra Civil Service.[124] Districts are subdivided into *sub-divisions* (Taluka) governed by sub-divisional magistrates, and again into *blocks*.[125] A block consists of panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities.[126][127] Talukas are intermediate level panchayat between the Zilla Parishad (district councils) at the district level and gram panchayat (village councils) at the lower level.[125][128]\n\n\nOut of the total population of Maharashtra, 45.22 per cent of people live in urban regions. The total figure of the population living in urban areas is 50.8\u00a0million. There are 27 Municipal Corporations in Maharashtra.[129]\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in MaharashtraAs of the 2011 Census\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | District |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Mumbai](image)MumbaiPunePune | 1 | Mumbai | Mumbai City district | 18,414,288\n | ![Nagpur](image)Nagpur![Nashik](image)Nashik |\n| 2 | Pune | Pune | 5,049,968\n |\n| 3 | Nagpur | Nagpur | 2,497,777\n |\n| 4 | Nashik | Nashik | 2,362,769\n |\n| 5 | Aurangabad | Aurangabad | 1,189,376\n |\n| 6 | Solapur | Solapur | 951,118\n |\n| 7 | Amravati | Amravati | 846,801\n |\n| 8 | Jalgaon | Jalgaon | 737,411\n |\n| 9 | Nanded |  Nanded | 550,564\n |\n| 10 | Kolhapur |  Kolhapur | 549,861\n |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the provisional results of the 2011 national census, Maharashtra was at that time the richest state in India and the second-most populous state in India with a population of 112,374,333. Contributing to 9.28 per cent of India's population, males and females are 58,243,056 and 54,131,277, respectively.[130] The total population growth in 2011 was 15.99 per cent while in the previous decade it was 22.57 per cent.[131][132] Since independence, the decadal growth rate of population has remained higher (except in the year 1971) than the national average. However, in the year 2011, it was found to be lower than the national average.[132] The 2011 census for the state found 55 per cent of the population to be rural with 45 per cent being urban-based.[133][134] Although, India hasn't conducted a caste-wise census since Independence, based on the British era census of 1931, it is estimated that the Maratha and the Maratha-kunbi numerically form the largest caste cluster with around 32 per cent of the population.[135] Maharashtra has a large Other Backward Class population constituting 41 per cent of the population. The scheduled tribes include *Adivasis* such as Thakar, Warli, Konkana and Halba.[136] The 2011 census found scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to account for 11.8 per cent and 8.9 per cent of the population, respectively.[137] The state also includes a substantial number of migrants from other states of India.[138] Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Karnataka account for the largest percentage of migrants to the Mumbai metropolitan area.[139]\n\n\nThe 2011 census reported the human sex ratio is 929 females per 1000 males, which were below the national average of 943. The density of Maharashtra was 365 inhabitants per km2 which was lower than the national average of 382 per km2. Since 1921, the populations of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg shrank by \u22124.96 per cent and \u22122.30 per cent, respectively, while the population of Thane grew by 35.9 per cent, followed by Pune at 30.3 per cent. The literacy rate is 83.2 per cent, higher than the national rate at 74.04 per cent.[140] Of this, male literacy stood at 89.82 per cent and female literacy 75.48 per cent.[141]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Maharashtra\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFile:Vitthal Tulsi.jpg\n![](image)\n![](image)\nVarkari saint Dnyaneshwar's palkhi (palanquin), Shree Siddhivinayak Temple Ganpati, Mumbai, Sai baba of Shirdi, \nPanduranga Vitthal Pandharpur, Khandoba temple Pune, Trimbakweshwar Jyotirlinga Temple entrance\n\nReligion in Maharashtra (2011)[142]\n\n\n\nHinduism (79.83%)\nIslam (11.54%)\nBuddhism (5.81%)\nJainism (1.25%)\nChristianity (0.96%)\nSikhism (0.20%)\nOther (0.16%)\nNot stated (0.25%)\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Hinduism was the principal religion in the state at 79.8 per cent of the total population. Muslims constituted 11.5 per cent of the total population. Maharastra has highest number of followers of Buddhism in India, accounting for 5.8 per cent of Maharashtra's total population with 6,531,200 followers. Marathi Buddhists account for 77.36% of all Buddhists in India.[143] Sikhs, Christians, and Jains constituted 0.2 per cent, 1.0 per cent, and 1.2 per cent of the Maharashtra population respectively.[142]\n\n\nMaharashtra, and particularly the city of Mumbai, is home to two tiny religious communities. This includes 5000 Jews, mainly belonging to the Bene Israel, and Baghdadi Jewish communities.[144] Parsi is the other community who follow Zoroastrianism. The 2011 census recorded around 44,000 parsis in Maharashtra.[145]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Languages of India and Marathi people\n\nLanguages of Maharashtra (2011)[146]\n\n\n\nMarathi (70.34%)\nHindi (10.70%)\nUrdu (6.71%)\nGujarati (2.06%)\nKhandeshi (1.44%)\nLambadi (1.40%)\nBhili (1.08%)\nTelugu (1.00%)\nKannada (0.89%)\nOthers (7.72%)\n\nMarathi is the official language although different regions have their own dialects.[5][147][148] Most people speak regional languages classified as dialects of Marathi in the census. Powari, Lodhi, and Varhadi are spoken in the Vidarbha region, Dangi is spoken near the Maharashtra-Gujarat border, Bhil languages are spoken throughout the northwest part of the state, Khandeshi (locally known as Ahirani) is spoken in Khandesh region. In the Desh and Marathwada regions, Dakhini Urdu is widely spoken, although Dakhini speakers are usually bilingual in Marathi.[149]\n\n\nKonkani, and its dialect Malvani, is spoken along the southern Konkan coast. Telugu and Kannada are spoken along the border areas of Telangana and Karnataka respectively. At the junction of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh a variety of Hindi dialects are spoken such as Lodhi and Powari. Lambadi is spoken through a wide area of eastern Marathwada and western Vidarbha. Gondi is spoken by diminishing minorities throughout Vidarbha, but most concentrated in the forests of Gadchiroli and the Telangana border.\n\n\nMarathi is the first language of a majority or plurality of the people in all districts of Maharastra except Nandurbar, where Bhili is spoken by 45% of its population. The highest percentage of Khandeshi speakers are Dhule district (29%) and the highest percentage of Gondi speakers are in Gadchiroli district (24%).[146]\n\n\nHindi is widely-spoken across Maharashtra, mainly as a second-language. The highest percentages of mother-tongue Hindi speakers are in urban areas, especially Mumbai and its suburbs, where it is mother tongue to over a quarter of the population. Pune and Nagpur are also home to large communities of Hindi-speakers. Gujarati and Urdu are also major languages in Mumbai, both are spoken by around 10% of the population.[146]\nUrdu and its dialect, the Dakhni are spoken by the Muslim population of the state.[150]\n\n\nThe Mumbai metropolitan area is home to migrants from all over India, and so Hindi is a common language. Many other languages are spoken in Mumbai including Telugu, Tamil, Konkani, Kannada, Sindhi, Punjabi, Bengali, Tulu to name a few.[146]\n\n\n\n## Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Maharashtra\n\nSee also: Politics of Maharashtra and List of Chief Ministers of Maharashtra\n\n![](image)Mantralaya or administrative headquarters of Maharashtra state government in South Mumbai\nThe state is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Maharashtra is one of the seven states in India where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council).[151] The legislature, the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. The Legislative Assembly consists of 288 members who are elected for five-year terms unless the Assembly is dissolved before to the completion of the term. The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 78 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years. The state has 48 seats in the Lok Sabha, or the lower chamber of the Indian Parliament, and 19 seats in the Rajya Sabha, or the upper chamber of the Indian Parliament.[152][153]\n\n\nThe government of Maharashtra is a democratically elected body in India with the Governor as its constitutional head who is appointed by the President of India for a five-year term.[154] The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister.[155] The governor remains a ceremonial head of the state, while the Chief Minister and his council are responsible for day-to-day government functions. The council of ministers consists of Cabinet Ministers and Ministers of State (MoS). The Secretariat headed by the Chief Secretary assists the council of ministers. The Chief Secretary is also the administrative head of the government. Each government department is headed by a Minister, who is assisted by an Additional Chief Secretary or a Principal Secretary, who is usually an officer of the Indian Administrative Service, the Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary serves as the administrative head of the department they are assigned to. Each department also has officers of the rank of Secretary, Special Secretary, Joint Secretary, etc. assisting the Minister and the Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary.\n\n\nFor purpose of administration, the state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts. Divisional Commissioner, an IAS officer is the head of administration at the divisional level. The administration in each district is headed by a District Magistrate, who is an IAS officer and is assisted by several officers belonging to state services. Urban areas in the state are governed by Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats, and seven Cantonment Boards.[132][156] The Maharashtra Police is headed by an IPS officer of the rank of Director general of police. A Superintendent of Police, an IPS officer assisted by the officers of the Maharashtra Police Service, is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order and related issues in each district. The Divisional Forest Officer, an officer belonging to the Indian Forest Service, manages the forests, environment, and wildlife of the district, assisted by the officers of Maharashtra Forest Service and Maharashtra Forest Subordinate Service.[157]\n\n\n\n![Maharashtra High Court](image)The Bombay High Court, one of the oldest high courts in India\nThe judiciary in the state consists of the Maharashtra High Court (The High Court of Bombay), district and session courts in each district and lower courts and judges at the taluka level.[158] The High Court has regional branches at Nagpur and Aurangabad in Maharashtra and Panaji which is the capital of Goa.[159] The state cabinet on 13 May 2015 passed a resolution favouring the setting up of one more bench of the Bombay high court in Kolhapur, covering the region.[160]\nThe President of India appoints the chief justice of the High Court of the Maharashtra judiciary on the advice of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of India as well as the Governor of Maharashtra.[161] Other judges are appointed by the chief justice of the high court of the judiciary on the advice of the Chief Justice.[162] Subordinate Judicial Service is another vital part of the judiciary of Maharashtra.[163] The subordinate judiciary or the district courts are categorised into two divisions: the Maharashtra civil judicial services and higher judicial service.[164] While the Maharashtra civil judicial services comprises the Civil Judges (Junior Division)/Judicial Magistrates and civil judges (Senior Division)/Chief Judicial Magistrate, the higher judicial service comprises civil and sessions judges.[165] The Subordinate judicial service of the judiciary is controlled by the District Judge.[162][166]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Politics of Maharashtra and List of Chief Ministers of Maharashtra\n\nThe politics of the state in the first decades after its formation in 1960 was dominated by the Indian National Congress party or its offshoots such as the Nationalist Congress Party. At present, it has been dominated by four political parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Nationalist Congress Party, the Indian National Congress and the Shivsena.\n\n\nJust like in other states in India, dynastic politics is fairly common also among political parties in Maharashtra.[167] The dynastic phenomenon is seen from the national level down to the district level and even village level. The three-tier structure of Panchayati Raj created in the state in the 1960s also helped to create and consolidate this phenomenon in rural areas. Apart from controlling the government, political families also control cooperative institutions, mainly cooperative sugar factories and district cooperative banks in the state.[168] The Bharatiya Janata Party also features several senior leaders who are dynasts.[169][170] In Maharashtra, the NCP has a particularly high level of dynasticism.[170]\n\n\nIn the early years, the politics of Maharashtra was dominated by Congress party figures such as Yashwantrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil, Vasantrao Naik, and Shankarrao Chavan. Sharad Pawar, who started his political career in the Congress party, has been a towering personality in state and national politics for over forty years. During his career, he has split the Congress twice with significant consequences for the state politics.[171][172] The Congress party enjoyed a near unchallenged dominance of the political landscape until 1995 when the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured an overwhelming majority in the state to form a coalition government.[173] After his second parting from the Congress party in 1999, Sharad Pawar founded the NCP but then formed a coalition with the Congress to keep out the BJP-Shiv Sena combine out of the Maharashtra state government for fifteen years until September 2014. Prithviraj Chavan of the Congress party was the last Chief Minister of Maharashtra under the Congress-NCP alliance.[174][175][176] For the 2014 assembly polls, the two alliances between NCP and Congress and that between BJP and Shiv Sena respectively broke down over seat allocations. In the election, the largest number of seats went to the Bharatiya Janata Party, with 122 seats. The BJP initially formed a minority government under Devendra Fadnavis. The Shiv Sena entered the Government after two months and provided a comfortable majority for the alliance in the Maharashtra Vidhansabha for the duration of the assembly.[177] In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance secured 41 seats out of 48 from the state.[178] Later in 2019, the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance fought the assembly elections together but the alliance broke down after the election over the post of the chief minister. Uddhav Thackeray of Shiv Sena then formed an alternative governing coalition under his leadership with his erstwhile opponents from NCP, INC, and several independent members of the legislative assembly.[179][180] Thackeray served as the 19th Chief minister of Maharashtra of the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition until June 2022.[181][182][183]\n\n\nIn late June 2022, Eknath Shinde, a senior Shiv Sena leader, and the majority of MLAs from Shiv Sena joined hands with the BJP.[184][185][186] Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called for a trust vote, an action that would later on be described as a \"sad spectacle\" by Supreme Court of India,[187] and draw criticism from Political Observers.[188] Uddhav Thackeray resigned from the post as chief minister well as a MLC member ahead of no-confidence motion on 29 June 2022.[189] Shinde subsequently formed a new coalition with the BJP, and was sworn in as the Chief Minister on 30 June 2022.[190] BJP leader, Devendra Fadnavis was given the post of Deputy Chief Minister in the new government.[190] Uddhav Thackeray filed a lawsuit in Supreme Court of India claiming that Eknath Shinde and his group's actions meant that they were disqualified under Anti-defection law, with Eknath Shinde claiming that he has not defected, but rather represents the true Shiv Sena party.[191][192] The supreme court delivered its verdict in May 2023. In its verdict the five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme court ruled that the Maharashtra governor and assembly speaker did not act as per the law.[193] However, the court said that it cannot order the restoration of the Uddhav Thackeray government as Thackeray resigned without facing a floor test.[194][191][195] Supreme Court also asked the Assembly Speaker to decide on the matter of disqualification of 16 MLAs including Chief Minister Eknath Shinde.[196][197] The case for decision on which faction has rights to use Shiv Sena Name and Symbol is currently being heard by Supreme Court.[198][199]\n\n\nIn July 2023, NCP leader Ajit Pawar, and a number of NCP state assembly members joined the Shivsena- BJP government led by Eknath Shinde.[200] Sharad Pawar, the founder of NCP, has condemned the move and expelled the rebels. Ajit Pawar has claimed support from majority of party legislators and office holders of the party, and has claimed the right to the NCP election symbol with the Election Commission of India.[201]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Maharashtra\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Net state domestic product at factor cost at current prices (2004\u201305 base)**[202]\nFigures in crores of Indian rupees\n |\n| Year | Net state domestic product\n |\n| 2004\u20132005 | \u20b93.683 trillion (US$44\u00a0billion)\n |\n| 2005\u20132006 | \u20b94.335 trillion (US$52\u00a0billion)\n |\n| 2006\u20132007 | \u20b95.241 trillion (US$63\u00a0billion)\n |\n| 2007\u20132008 | \u20b96.140 trillion (US$74\u00a0billion)\n |\n| 2008\u20132009 | \u20b96.996 trillion (US$84\u00a0billion)\n |\n| 2009\u20132010 | \u20b98.178 trillion (US$98\u00a0billion)\n |\n| 2013\u20132014 | \u20b915.101 trillion (US$180\u00a0billion)\n |\n| 2014\u20132015 | \u20b916.866 trillion (US$200\u00a0billion)\n |\n\n\nThe economy of Maharashtra is driven by manufacturing, international trade, Mass Media (television, motion pictures, video games, recorded music), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism.[203] Maharashtra is the most industrialised state and has maintained the leading position in the industrial sector in India.[204] The State is a pioneer in small scale industries.[205] Mumbai, the capital of the state and the financial capital of India, houses the headquarters of most of the major corporate and financial institutions.

It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes like BARC, NPCL, IREL, TIFR, AERB, AECI, and the Department of Atomic Energy.[212]\n\n\n\n![refer caption](image)Freshly grown sugarcane. Agriculture is the second leading occupation in Maharashtra.\nWith more than half the population being rural, agriculture and allied industries play an important role in the states's economy and source of income for the rural population.[219] The agriculture and allied activities sector contributes 12.9 per cent to the state's income. Staples such as rice and millet are the main monsoon crops. Important cash crops include sugarcane, cotton, oilseeds, tobacco, fruit, vegetables, and spices such as turmeric.[98] Animal husbandry is an important agriculture-related activity. The State's share in the livestock and poultry population in India is about 7 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Maharashtra was a pioneer in the development of Agricultural Cooperative Societies after independence. It was an integral part of the then Governing Congress party's vision of 'rural development with local initiative'. A 'special' status was accorded to the sugar cooperatives and the government assumed the role of a mentor by acting as a stakeholder, guarantor, and regulator,[220][221][222] Apart from sugar, cooperatives play a crucial role in dairy,[223] cotton, and fertiliser industries.\n\n\nThe banking sector comprises scheduled and non-scheduled banks.[215] Scheduled banks are of two types, commercial and cooperative. Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India are classified into five types: State Bank of India and its associates, nationalised banks, private sector banks, Regional Rural Banks, and others (foreign banks). In 2012, there were 9,053 banking offices in the state, of which about 26 per cent were in rural and 54 per cent were in urban areas. Maharashtra has a microfinance system, which refers to small-scale financial services extended to the poor in both rural and urban areas. It covers a variety of financial instruments, such as lending, savings, life insurance, and crop insurance.[224] The three largest urban cooperative banks in India are all based in Maharashtra.[225]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Maharashtra\n\nSee also: List of airports in Maharashtra\n\n![Landscaped four-lane road over rolling terrain](image)Mumbai\u2013Nashik Expressway\n![](image)\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Mumbai)\n![](image)\nA container ship at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust\n\nThe state has a large, multi-modal transportation system with the largest road network in India.[226] In 2011, the total length of surface road in Maharashtra was 267,452\u00a0km;[227] national highways accounted for 4,176\u00a0km,[228] and state highways 3,700\u00a0km.[227] The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) provides economical and reliable passenger road transport service in the public sector.[229] These buses, popularly called ST (State Transport), are the preferred mode of transport for much of the populace. Hired forms of transport include metered taxis and auto-rickshaws, which often ply specific routes in cities. Other district roads and village roads provide villages, accessibility to meet their social needs as well as the means to transport agricultural produce from villages to nearby markets. Major district roads provide a secondary function of linking between main roads and rural roads. Approximately 98 per cent of villages are connected either via the highways or modern roads in Maharashtra. Average speed on state highways varies between 50 and 60\u00a0km/h (31\u201337\u00a0mi/h) due to the heavy presence of vehicles; in villages and towns, speeds are as low as 25\u201330\u00a0km/h (15\u201318\u00a0mi/h).[230]\n\n\nThe first passenger train in India ran from Mumbai to Thane on 16 April 1853.[231]\nRail transportation is run by the Central Railway, Western Railway, South Central Railway, and South East Central Railway zones of the Indian Railways with the first two zones being headquartered in Mumbai, at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Churchgate respectively. Konkan Railway is headquartered in Navi Mumbai.[232][233] The Mumbai Rajdhani Express, the fastest Rajdhani train, connects the Indian capital of New Delhi to Mumbai.[234] Thane and CSMT are the busiest railway stations in India,[235] the latter serving as a terminal for both long-distance trains and commuter trains of the Mumbai Suburban Railway.\n\n\nThe two principal seaports, Mumbai Port and Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which is also in the Mumbai region, are under the control and supervision of the government of India.[236] There are around 48 minor ports in Maharashtra.[237] Most of these handle passenger traffic and have a limited capacity. None of the major rivers in Maharashtra are navigable and so river transport does not exist in the state.\n\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (formerly Bombay International Airport), is the state's largest airport. The four other international airports are Pune International Airport, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport at Nagpur, Nashik Airport, Shirdi Airport. Aurangabad Airport, Kolhapur Airport, Jalgaon Airport, and Nanded Airport are domestic airports in the state. Most of the State's airfields are operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) while Reliance Airport Developers (RADPL), currently operates five non-metro airports at Latur, Nanded, Baramati, Osmanabad and Yavatmal on a 95-year lease.[238] The Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) was set up in 2002 to take up development of airports in the state that are not under the AAI or the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). MADC is playing the lead role in the planning and implementation of the Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN) project.[239] Additional smaller airports include Akola, Amravati, Chandrapur, Ratnagiri, and Solapur.[240] Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha Metro), headquartered in Nagpur is a Joint Venture establishment of Government of India & Government of Maharashtra headquartered in Nagpur, India. Maha Metro is responsible for the implementation of all Maharashtra state metro projects, except the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Mumbai Metro is operational since 8 June 2014.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Education in Maharashtra and List of higher education institutions in Maharashtra\n\n![](image)Students at a state-run primary school in Raigad district\nThe state has been known for its pioneering role in the development of the modern education system in India. Most of the private colleges including religious and special-purpose institutions were set up in the last thirty years after the State Government of Vasantdada Patil liberalised the Education Sector in 1982.[241] Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education or any central board. Students choose from one of three streams, namely liberal arts, commerce, or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs. Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts, including religious institutions. The medium of instruction in most of the schools is mainly Marathi, English, or Hindi, though Urdu is also used. The secondary schools are affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Institute of Open School (NIOS), and the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education.\n\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1887, Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) is one of the oldest engineering colleges in Asia.\n![](image)Situated in Pune, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune was established in 1948 after the Indian independence.\nMaharashtra has 24 universities with a turnout of 160,000 Graduates every year.[242][243] Established during the rule of East India company in 1857 as Bombay University, The University of Mumbai, is the largest university in the world in terms of the number of graduates.[244] It has 141 affiliated colleges.[245] According to a report published by The Times Education magazine, 5 to 7 Maharashtra colleges and universities are ranked among the top 20 in India.[246][247][248] Maharashtra is also home to notable autonomous institutes as Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Indian Institute of Information Technology Pune, College of Engineering Pune (CoEP), Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Institute of Chemical Technology, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Walchand College of Engineering, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) and Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE).[249] Most of these autonomous institutes are ranked the highest in India and have very competitive entry requirements. The University of Pune (now Savitribai Phule Pune University), the National Defence Academy, Film and Television Institute of India, Armed Forces Medical College, and National Chemical Laboratory were established in Pune soon after the Indian independence in 1947. Mumbai has an IIT, has National Institute of Industrial Engineering and Nagpur has IIM and AIIMS. Other notable institutes in the state are: Maharashtra National Law University, Nagpur (MNLUN), Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai (MNLUM), Maharashtra National Law University, Aurangabad (MNLUA), Government Law College, Mumbai (GLC), ILS Law College, and Symbiosis Law School (SLS)\n\n\n\n![](image)Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (Agricultural University) at Akola\nAgricultural universities include Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth, and Dr. Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth,[250] Regional universities viz. Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, North Maharashtra University, Shivaji University, Solapur University, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, and Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University are established to cover the educational needs at the district levels of the state. deemed universities are established in Maharashtra, including Symbiosis International University, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, and Tilak Maharashtra University.[251]\n\n\nVocational training in different trades such as construction, plumbing, welding, automobile mechanics is offered by post-secondary school Industrial Training Institute (ITIs).[252] Local community colleges also exist with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[253] Scottish missionary John Wilson, Indian nationalists such as Vasudev Balwant Phadke and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, social reformers such as Jyotirao Phule, Dhondo Keshav Karve and Bhaurao Patil played a leading role in the setting up of modern schools and colleges during the British colonial era.[254][255][256][257] The forerunner of Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute was established in 1821. The Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women's University, the oldest women's liberal arts college in South Asia, started its journey in 1916. College of Engineering Pune, established in 1854, is the third oldest college in Asia.[258] Government Polytechnic Nagpur, established in 1914, is one of the oldest polytechnics in India.[259]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Primary Healthcare centre in the village of Amboli in Pune district\nHealth indicators of Maharashtra show that they have attained relatively high growth against a background of high per capita income (PCI).[260] In 2011, the health care system in Maharashtra consisted of 363 rural government hospitals,[261] 23 district hospitals (with 7,561 beds), 4 general hospitals (with 714 beds) mostly under the Maharashtra Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and 380 private medical establishments; these establishments provide the state with more than 30,000 hospital beds.[262] It is the first state in India to have nine women's hospitals serving 1,365 beds.[262] The state also has a significant number of medical practitioners who hold the Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery qualifications. These practitioners primarily use the traditional Indian therapy of Ayurveda, nevertheless, modern western medicine is used as well.[263]\n\n\nIn Maharashtra as well as in the rest of India, Primary Health Centre (PHC) is part of the government-funded public health system and is the most basic unit of the healthcare system. They are essentially single-physician clinics usually with facilities for minor surgeries, too.[264] Maharashtra has a life expectancy at birth of 67.2 years in 2011, ranking it third among 29 Indian states.[265] The total fertility rate of the state is 1.9.[266] The Infant mortality rate is 28 and the maternal mortality ratio is 104 (2012\u20132013), which are lower than the national averages.[267][268] Public health services are governed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), through various departments. The Ministry is divided into two departments: the Public Health Department, which includes family welfare and medical relief, and the Department of Medical Education and Drugs.[269][270]\n\n\nHealth insurance includes any program that helps pay for medical expenses, through privately purchased insurance, social insurance, or a social welfare program funded by the government.[271] In a more technical sense, the term is used to describe any form of insurance that protects against the costs of medical services.[272] This usage includes private insurance and social insurance programs such as National Health Mission, which pools resources and spreads the financial risk associated with major medical expenses across the entire population to protect everyone, as well as social welfare programs such as National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Health Insurance Program, which assist people who cannot afford health coverage.[271][272][273]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\n![Current functioning units of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station](image)Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station, the state's power production source\nAlthough its population makes Maharashtra one of the country's largest energy users,[274][275] conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centres, and strong environmental movements have kept its per capita energy use to one of the smallest of any Indian state.[276] The high electricity demand of the state constitutes 13 per cent of the total installed electricity generation capacity in India, which is mainly from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.[277] Mahavitaran is responsible for the distribution of electricity throughout the state by buying power from Mahanirmiti, captive power plants, other state electricity boards, and private sector power generation companies.[276]\n\n\nAs of 2012, Maharashtra was the largest power generating state in India, with an installed electricity generation capacity of 26,838 MW.[275] The state forms a major constituent of the western grid of India, which now comes under the North, East, West and North Eastern (NEWNE) grids of India.[274] Maharashtra Power Generation Company (MAHAGENCO) operates thermal power plants.[278] In addition to the state government-owned power generation plants, there are privately owned power generation plants that transmit power through the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company, which is responsible for the transmission of electricity in the state.[279]\n\n\n\n### Environmental protection and sustainability[edit]\n\n\nMaharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is established and responsible for implementing various environmental legislations in the state principally including the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Water (Cess) Act, 1977 and some of the provisions under Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 and the rules framed there under it including, Biomedical Waste (M&H) Rules, 1998, Hazardous Waste (M&H) Rules, 2000, and Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000. MPCB is functioning under the administrative control of the Environment Department of the Government of Maharashtra.[280] The Maharashtra Plastic and Thermocol Products ban became effective as law on 23 June 2018, subjecting plastic users to fines and potential imprisonment for repeat offenders.[281][282]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Maharashtra and List of State Protected Monuments in Maharashtra\n\nFurther information: Cultural activities of Maharashtra\n\n![](image)Maharashtrian vegetarian Thali\n![](image)Misal Paav, a popular dish from Maharashtra\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maharashtrian cuisine\n\nMaharashtrian cuisine includes a variety of dishes ranging from mild to very spicy ones. Wheat, rice, *jowar*, *bajri*, vegetables, lentils and fruit form staple food of the Maharashtrian diet. Some of the popular traditional dishes include *puran poli*, *ukdiche modak*, *Thalipeeth.*[283] Street food items like *Batata wada,* *Misal Pav*, *Pav Bhaji* and *Vada pav* are very popular among the locals and are usually sold on stalls and in small hotels.[284] Meals (mainly lunch and dinner) are served on a plate called thali. Each food item served on the *thali* is arranged in a specific way. All non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes are eaten with boiled rice, chapatis or with bhakris, made of jowar, bajra or rice flours. A typical vegetarian thali is made of chapati or bhakri (Indian flat bread), dal, rice (varan bhaat), amti, *bhaji or usal*, chutney, *koshimbir* (salad) and buttermilk or *Sol kadhi*. A *bhaji* is a vegetable dish made of a particular vegetable or combination of vegetables. *Aamti* is variant of the curry, typically consisting of a lentil (*tur*) stock, flavoured with goda masala and sometimes with tamarind or amshul, and jaggery (*gul*).[284][285] *Varan* is nothing but plain dal, a common Indian lentil stew. More or less, most of the dishes use coconut, onion, garlic, ginger, red chili powder, green chilies, and mustard though some section of the population traditionally avoid onion and garlics.[286][284]\n\n\nMaharashtrian cuisine varies with the regions. Malvani (Konkani), Kolhapuri, and Varhadhi cuisins are examples of well known regional cuisines.[286] Kolhapur is famous for Tambda Pandhra rassa, a dish made of either chicken or mutton.[287] Rice and seafood are the staple foods of the coastal Konkani people. Among seafood, the most popular is a fish variety called the Bombay duck (also known as bombil in Marathi).\n\n\n\n### Attire[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A woman in Pune wearing traditional Maharashtrian Nauvari lugada (nine-yard sari)\nTraditionally, Marathi women commonly wore the sari, often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs.[288] Most middle-aged and young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and trousers or shalwar kameez with the traditionally *nauvari* or nine-yard lugade,[289] disappearing from the markets due to a lack of demand.[290] Older women wear the five-yard sari. In urban areas, the five-yard sari, especially the Paithani, is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies.[291] Among men, western dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the dhoti, and pheta[292] on cultural occasions. The Gandhi cap is the popular headgear among older men in rural Maharashtra.[288][293][294] Women wear traditional jewellery derived from Maratha and Peshwa dynasties. Kolhapuri saaj, a special type of necklace, is also worn by Marathi women.[288] In urban areas, western attire is dominant amongst women and men.[294]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMaharashtra and Maharashtrian artists have been influential in preserving and developing Hindustani classical music for more than a century. Notable practitioners of Kirana or Gwalior style called Maharashtra their home. The Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Festival in Pune started by Bhimsen Joshi in the 1950s is considered the most prestigious Hindustani music festival in India, if not one of the largest.[295]\n\n\nCities like Kolhapur and Pune have been playing a major role in the preservation of music like Bhavageet and Natya Sangeet, which are inherited from Indian classical music. The biggest form of Indian popular music is songs from films produced in Mumbai. Film music, in 2009 made up 72 per cent of the music sales in India.[296] Most the influential music composers and singers have called Mumbai their home.\n\n\nIn recent decades, the music scene in Maharashtra, and particularly in Mumbai has seen a growth of newer music forms such as rap.[297] The city also holds festivals in western music genres such as blues.[298] In 2006, the Symphony Orchestra of India was founded, housed at the NCPA in Mumbai. It is today the only professional symphony orchestra in India and presents two concert seasons per year, with world-renowned conductors and soloists.\n\n\nMaharashtra has a long and rich tradition of folk music. Some of the most common forms of folk music in practice are Bhajan, Bharud, Kirtan, Gondhal,[299] and Koli Geet.[300]\n\n\n\n### Dance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lavani performance\nMarathi dance forms draw from folk traditions. Lavani is popular form of dance in the state. The Bhajan, Kirtan and Abhangas of the Warkari sect (Vaishanav Devotees) have a long history and are part of their daily rituals.[301][302] Koli dance (called 'Koligeete') is among the most popular dances of Maharashtra. As the name suggests, it is related to the fisher folk of Maharashtra, who are called Kolis. Popular for their unique identity and liveliness, their dances represent their occupation. This type of dance is represented by both men and women. While dancing, they are divided into groups of two. These fishermen display the movements of waves and casting of the nets during their koli dance performances.[303][304]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marathi theatre\n\n![](image)Playwright Vijay Tendulkar\nModern Theatre in Maharashtra can trace its origins to the British colonial era in the middle of the 19th century. It is modelled mainly after the western tradition but also includes forms like Sangeet Natak (musical drama). In recent decades, Marathi Tamasha has also been incorporated in some experimental plays.[305]\nThe repertoire of Marathi theatre ranges from humorous social plays, farces, historical plays, and musical, to experimental plays and serious drama. Marathi Playwrights such as Vijay Tendulkar, P. L. Deshpande, Mahesh Elkunchwar, Ratnakar Matkari, and Satish Alekar have influenced theatre throughout India.[306] Besides Marathi theatre, Maharashtra and particularly, Mumbai, has had a long tradition of theatre in other languages such as Gujarati, Hindi, and English.[307]\n\n\nThe National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCP) is a multi-venue, multi-purpose cultural centre in Mumbai which hosts events in music, dance, theatre, film, literature, and photography from India as well other places. It also presents new and innovative work in the performing arts field.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marathi literature\n\n![](image)P L Deshpande (at centre), one of the most popular authors in Marathi language\nMaharashtra's regional literature is about the lives and circumstances of Marathi people in specific parts of the state.

His work includes humour, travelogues, plays, and biographies.[312] Narayan Surve, Shanta Shelke, Durga Bhagwat, Suresh Bhat, and Narendra Jadhav are some of the more recent authors\n\n\nDalit literature originally emerged in the Marathi language as a literary response to the everyday oppressions of caste in mid-twentieth-century independent India, critiquing caste practices by experimenting with various literary forms.[313]\nIn 1958, the term \"Dalit literature\" was used for the first conference of *Maharashtra Dalit Sahitya Sangha* (Maharashtra Dalit Literature Society) in Mumbai.[314]\n\n\nMaharashtra, and particularly the cities in the state such as Mumbai and Pune are diverse with different languages being spoken. Mumbai is called home by writers in English such as Rohinton Mistry, Shobha De, and Salman Rushdie. Their novels are set with Mumbai as the backdrop.[315] Many eminent Urdu poets such as Kaifi Azmi, Jan Nissar Akhtar, Gulzar, and Javed Akhtar have been residents of Mumbai.\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bollywood and Marathi cinema\n\n![](image)Amitabh Bachchan, one of the most popular actors of the Mumbai film industry of the last fifty years\nFirst Indian feature length film, Raja Harishchandra, was made in Maharashtra by Dadasaheb Phalke in 1913.[316] Dadasaheb Phalke is widely considered the father of Indian cinema.[317] The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest award in cinema, given annually by the Government of India for lifetime contribution to Indian cinema.[318]\n\n\nThe Marathi film industry, initially located in Kolhapur, has spread throughout Mumbai.

In this period, the Mughal government directly controlled little territory further than fifty miles from the capital. Even this was fiercely fought over. Jats and Rohillas disputed for the territory; factions fought for the throne, and the Afghan king, Ahmad Shah Abdali, periodically descended on the capital.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> For the Marathas, probably the two most significant events of the whole chaotic period in Delhi were a treaty in 1752, which made them protector of the Mughal throne (and gave them the right to collect chauth in the Punjab), and the civil war of 1753, by which the Maratha nominee ended up on the Mughal throne.- [58]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n2. **^** Mumbai Cricket Association control governs cricket in Mumbai district, Palghar district and Thane districts and select players for their Mumbai cricket team from these areas only.\n3. **^** Maharashtra Open is the only ATP championship in South Asia.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jerry Pinto; Naresh Fernandes (2003). *Bombay, Meri Jaan: Writings on Mumbai*.

The House listing phase began on 1 April 2010 and involved the collection of information about all buildings. Information for National Population Register (NPR) was also collected in the first phase, which will be used to issue a 12-digit unique identification number to all registered Indian residents by Unique Identification Authority of India. The second population enumeration phase was conducted between 9 and 28 February 2011. Census has been conducted in India since 1872 and 2011 marks the first time biometric information was collected. According to the provisional reports released on 31 March 2011, the Indian population increased to 1.21 billion with a decadal growth of 17.70%.[2] Adult literacy rate increased to 74.04% with a decadal growth of 9.21%. The motto of the census was *Our Census, Our Future*.\n\n\nSpread across 28 states[a] and 8 union territories, the census covered 640 districts, 5,924 sub-districts, 7,935 towns and more than 600,000 villages. A total of 2.7 million officials visited households in 7,935 towns and 600,000 villages, classifying the population according to gender, religion, education and occupation.[3] The cost of the exercise was approximately \u20b92,200 crore (US$260\u00a0million)[4] \u2013 this comes to less than US$0.50 per person, well below the estimated world average of US$4.60 per person.[3] Conducted every 10 years, this census faced big challenges considering India's vast area and diversity of cultures and opposition from the manpower involved.\n\n\nInformation on castes was included in the census following demands from several ruling coalition leaders including Lalu Prasad Yadav, and Mulayam Singh Yadav supported by opposition parties Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiromani Akali Dal, Shiv Sena and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.[5] Information on caste was last collected during the British Raj in 1931. During the early census, people often exaggerated their caste status to garner social status and it is expected that people downgrade it now in the expectation of gaining government benefits.[6] Earlier, There was speculation that there would be a caste-based census conducted in 2011, the first time for 80 years (last was in 1931), to find the exact population of the \"Other Backward Classes\" (OBCs) in India.[7][8][9][10] This was later accepted and the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 was conducted whose first findings were revealed on 3 July 2015 by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.[11] Mandal Commission report of 1980 quoted OBC population at 52%, though National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) survey of 2006 quoted OBC population at 41%.[12]\n\n\nThere is only one instance of a caste count in post-independence India. It was conducted in Kerala in 1968 by the Government of Kerala under E. M. S. Namboodiripad to assess the social and economic backwardness of various lower castes. The census was termed Socio-Economic Survey of 1968 and the results were published in the Gazetteer of Kerala, 1971.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nC. Chandramouli IAS was the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India for the 2011 Indian census. Census data was collected in 16 languages and the training manual was prepared in 18 languages. In 2011, India and Bangladesh also conducted their first-ever joint census of areas along their border.[14][15] The census was conducted in two phases. The first, the house-listing phase, began on 1 April 2010 and involved collection of data about all the buildings and census houses.[16] Information for the National Population Register was also collected in the first phase. The second, the population enumeration phase, was conducted from 9 \u2013 28 February 2011 all over the country. The eradication of epidemics, the availability of more effective medicines for the treatment of various types of diseases and the improvement in the standard of living were the main reasons for the high decadal growth of population in India.\n\n\n\n## Information[edit]\n\n\n### House-listings[edit]\n\n\nThe House-listing schedule contained 35 questions.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1.

Effective literacy rate increased to a total of 74.04% with 82.14% of the males and 65.46% of the females being literate.[83]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Effective literacy rate (1901-2011)[*citation needed*] |\n| --- |\n| S.No.\n | Census year\n | Total (%)\n | Male (%)\n | Female (%)\n |\n| 1 | 1901 | 5.35 | 9.83 | 0.60\n |\n| 2 | 1911 | 5.92 | 10.56 | 1.05\n |\n| 3 | 1921 | 7.16 | 12.21 | 1.81\n |\n| 4 | 1931 | 9.50 | 15.59 | 2.93\n |\n| 5 | 1941 | 16.10 | 24.90 | 7.30\n |\n| 6 | 1951 | 16.67 | 24.95 | 9.45\n |\n| 7 | 1961 | 24.02 | 34.44 | 12.95\n |\n| 8 | 1971 | 29.45 | 39.45 | 18.69\n |\n| 9 | 1981 | 36.23 | 46.89 | 24.82\n |\n| 10 | 1991 | 42.84 | 52.74 | 32.17\n |\n| 11 | 2001 | 64.83 | 75.26 | 53.67\n |\n| 12 | 2011 | 74.04 | 82.14 | 65.46\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n\n\n* Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011\n* Demography of India\n* Irreligion in India\n* Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n* Other Backward Class\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Prior to the creation of Telangana.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Decadal Growth censusindia.gov.in\". *Census India*. 31 May 2011.

It was also India's most densely populated state, with 1,106 persons per square kilometre. The sex ratio was 918 females per 1000 males.[1] Almost 58% of Bihar's population was below 25 years age, which is the highest in India.

It is situated along the Bay of Bengal, along with a population of over 91 million inhabitants within an area of 88,752\u00a0km2 (34,267\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) as of 2011. The population estimate as of 2023 is 102,552,787.[12] West Bengal is the fourth-most populous and thirteenth-largest state by area in India, as well as the eighth-most populous country subdivision of the world. As a part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the north. It also borders the Indian states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata, the third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by population in India. West Bengal includes the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region, the coastal Sundarbans and the Bay of Bengal. The state's main ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus forming the demographic majority.\n\n\nThe area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas, while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was part of several ancient pan\u2212Indian empires, including the Vangas, Mauryans, and the Guptas. The citadel of Gau\u1e0da served as the capital of the Gau\u1e0da Kingdom, the Pala Empire, and the Sena Empire. Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate, but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, the Muslim faith spread across the entire Bengal region. During the Bengal Sultanate, the territory was a major trading nation in the world, and was often referred by the Europeans as the \"richest country to trade with\". It was absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576. Simultaneously, some parts of the region were ruled by several Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, and part of it was briefly overrun by the Suri Empire. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in the early 1700s, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the first Industrial revolution.[13][14] The region was later annexed into the Bengal Presidency by the British East India Company after the Battle of Buxar in 1764.[15][16] From 1772 to 1911, Calcutta was the capital of all of East India Company's territories and then the capital of the entirety of India after the establishment of the Viceroyalty.[17] From 1912 to India's Independence in 1947, it was the capital of the Bengal Province.[18]\n\n\nThe region was a hotbed of the Indian independence movement and has remained one of India's great artistic and intellectual centres.[19] Following widespread religious violence, the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal in 1947 along religious lines into two independent dominions: West Bengal, a Hindu-majority Indian state, and East Bengal, a Muslim-majority province of Pakistan which later became the independent Bangladesh. The state was also flooded with Hindu refugees from East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) in the decades following the 1947 partition of India, transforming its landscape and shaping its politics.[20][21] The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including what became known as the Bengali Renaissance. Several regional and pan\u2212Indian empires throughout Bengal's history have shaped its culture, cuisine, and architecture.\n\n\nPost-Indian independence, as a welfare state, West Bengal's economy is based on agricultural production and small and medium-sized enterprises.[22] The state's cultural heritage, besides varied folk traditions, ranges from stalwarts in literature including Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore to scores of musicians, film-makers and artists. For several decades, the state underwent political violence and economic stagnation after the beginning of communist rule in 1977 before it rebounded.[23] In 2023\u201324, the economy of West Bengal is the sixth-largest state economy in India with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of \u20b917.19 lakh crore (US$210\u00a0billion),[5] and has the country's 20th-highest GSDP per capita of \u20b9121,267 (US$1,500)[24] as of 2020-21. Despite being one of the fastest-growing major economies, West Bengal has struggled to attract foreign direct investment due to adverse land acquisition policies, poor infrastructure, and red tape.[25][26] It also has the 26th-highest ranking among Indian states in human development index, with the index value being lower than the Indian average.[8][22] The state government debt of \u20b96.47 lakh crore (US$78\u00a0billion), or 37.67% of GSDP, has dropped from 40.65% since 2010\u201311.[27][5] West Bengal has three World Heritage sites and ranks as the eight-most visited tourist destination in India and third-most visited state of India globally.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Bengal\n\nThe origin of the name Bengal (*Bangla* and *Bongo* in Bengali) is unknown. One theory suggests the word derives from \"Bang\", the name of a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000\u00a0BCE.[30] The Bengali word *Bongo* might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of *Vanga* (or *Banga*). Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name *Vanga*, the region's early history is obscure.[31]\n\n\nIn 1947, at the end of British rule over the Indian subcontinent the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal, which continued as an Indian state and East Bengal, a province of Pakistan, which came to be known be as East Pakistan and later became the independent Bangladesh.[11][32]\n\n\nIn 2011 the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name of the state to Paschim Banga (Bengali: \u09aa\u09b6\u09cd\u099a\u09bf\u09ae\u09ac\u0999\u09cd\u0997 *P\u00f4shchimb\u00f4ngg\u00f4*).[33] This is the native name of the state, literally meaning \"western Bengal\" in the native Bengali language. In August 2016 the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed another resolution to change the name of West Bengal to \"Bengal\" in English and \"Bangla\" in Bengali. Despite the Trinamool Congress government's efforts to forge a consensus on the name change resolution, the Indian National Congress, the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the resolution.[34] However, the central government has turned down the proposal maintaining the state should have one single name for all languages instead of three and it should not be the same as that of any other territory (pointing out that the name 'Bangla' may create confusion with neighbouring Bangladesh).[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Bengal, History of rulers of Bengal, and History of West Bengal\n\n### Ancient and classical period[edit]\n\n\n![A coin of the King Shashanka showing the obverse and reverse sides](image)Coin of the King Shashanka, who created the first separate political entity in Bengal, called the Gauda Kingdom\nStone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state, showing human occupation 8,000 years earlier than scholars had thought.[37] According to the Indian epic *Mahabharata* the region was part of the Vanga Kingdom.[38] Several Vedic realms were present in the Bengal region, including Vanga, Rarh, Pundravardhana and the Suhma Kingdom. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100\u00a0BCE of a land named Gangaridai located at the mouths of the Ganges.[39] Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, the Lower Malay Peninsula and Sumatra).[40] According to the Sri Lankan chronicle *Mahavamsa,* Prince Vijaya (c.\u2009543\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009505 BCE), a Vanga Kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka) and named the country Sinhala Kingdom.[41]\n\n\nThe kingdom of Magadha was formed in the 7th\u00a0century BCE, consisting of the regions now comprising Bihar and Bengal. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of the lives of Mahavira, the principal figure of Jainism and Gautama Buddha, founder of Buddhism. It consisted of several janapadas, or kingdoms.[42] Under Ashoka, the Maurya Empire of Magadha in the 3rd\u00a0century BCE extended over nearly all of South Asia, including Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan. From the 3rd to the 6th\u00a0centuries CE, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire.[43]\n\n\n\n![A map showing the extent of the Pala Empire](image)The Pala Empire was an imperial power during the Late Classical period on the Indian subcontinent, which originated in the region of Bengal.\nTwo kingdoms\u2014Vanga or Samatata, and Gauda\u2014are said in some texts to have appeared after the end of the Gupta Empire although details of their ascendancy are uncertain.[44] The first recorded independent king of Bengal was Shashanka, who reigned in the early 7th\u00a0century.[45] Shashanka is often recorded in Buddhist annals as an intolerant Hindu ruler noted for his persecution of the Buddhists. He murdered Rajyavardhana, the Buddhist king of Thanesar, and is noted for destroying the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, and replacing Buddha statues with Shiva lingams.[46] After a period of anarchy,[47]:\u200a36 the Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years beginning in the 8th\u00a0century. A shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty followed.[48]\n\n\nRajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty invaded some areas of Bengal between 1021 and 1023.[49]\n\n\nIslam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate.[50] Following the Ghurid conquests led by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, it spread across the entire Bengal region. Mosques, madrasas and khanqahs were built throughout these stages. During the Islamic Bengal Sultanate, founded in 1352, Bengal was a major world trading nation and was often referred by the Europeans as the richest country with which to trade.[51] Later, in 1576, it was absorbed into the Mughal Empire.[52]\n\n\n\n### Medieval and early modern periods[edit]\n\n\n![Firoz Minar a red stone tower at Gauda](image)Firoz Minar at Gau\u1e0da was built during the Bengal Sultanate.\nSubsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region.[53] It was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate for the next few hundred years. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha. In the 16th\u00a0century, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi. Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb and the Governor of Bengal, Shaista Khan, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the world's first Industrial revolution.[13][14] The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era.[54][55]\n\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![An map of Bengal in 1880](image)An 1880 map of Bengal\nSeveral European traders reached this area in the late 15th\u00a0century. The British East India Company defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab, in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The company gained the right to collect revenue in Bengal subah (province) in 1765 with the signing of the treaty between the East India company and the Mughal emperor following the Battle of Buxar in 1764.[56] The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765; it later incorporated all British-controlled territory north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab. The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives due to tax policies enacted by the British company.[57] Calcutta, the headquarters of the East India company, was named the capital of British-held territories in India in 1773.[58] The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in a transfer of authority to the British Crown,[59] administered by the Viceroy of India.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Subhas Chandra Bose, he was a leading freedom fighter of India\nThe Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj socio-cultural reform movements significantly influenced the cultural and economic life of Bengal.[61] Between 1905 and 1911 an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones.[62] Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943, which claimed three\u00a0million lives during World War\u00a0II.[63] Bengalis played a major role in the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant.[64] Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when news of Subhas Chandra Bose leading the Indian National Army against the British reached Bengal. The Indian National Army was subsequently routed by the British.[65]\n\n\n\n### Indian independence and afterwards[edit]\n\n\nWhen India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines. The western part went to the Dominion of India and was named West Bengal. The eastern part went to the Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan in 1956), becoming the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971.[66] In 1950 the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal.[67] In 1955 the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were also subsequently merged with West Bengal. Both West and East Bengal experienced large influxes of refugees during and after the partition in 1947. Refugee resettlement and related issues continued to play a significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state.[67]\n\n\n\n![A photograph of the engine and several cars of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway with people on either side of it](image)The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist\u2013Maoist movement by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation and deindustrialisation.[23] The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in an influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure.[68] The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), governed the state for the next three decades.[69]\n\n\nThe state's economic recovery gathered momentum after the central government introduced economic liberalisations in the mid-1990s. This was aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services. Beginning in the mid-2000s, armed activists conducted minor terrorist attacks in some parts of the state.[70][71] Clashes with the administration took place at several controversial locations over the issue of industrial land acquisition.[72][73] This became a decisive reason behind the defeat of the ruling Left Front government in the 2011 assembly election.[74] Although the economy was severely damaged during the unrest in the 1970s, the state has managed to revive its economy steadily throughout the years.[75][76][77] The state has shown improvement regarding *bandhs* (strikes)[78][79][80] and educational infrastructure.[81] Significant strides have been made in reducing unemployment,[82] though the state suffers from substandard healthcare services,[83][84] a lack of socio-economic development,[85] poor infrastructure,[86] unemployment and civil violence.[87][88] In 2006 the state's healthcare system was severely criticised in the aftermath of the West Bengal blood test kit scam.[89][90]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of West Bengal and Climate of West Bengal\n\n![](image)Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by a monsoon.\nWest Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India, stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The state has a total area of 88,752 square kilometres (34,267\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[3] The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state is a part of the eastern Himalayas mountain range. In this region is Sandakfu, which, at 3,636\u00a0m (11,929\u00a0ft), is the highest peak in the state.[91] The narrow Terai region separates the hills from the North Bengal plains, which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south. The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands. A small coastal region is in the extreme south, while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta.[92]\n\n\nThe main river in West Bengal is the Ganges, which divides into two branches. One branch enters Bangladesh as the *Padma*, or *P\u00f4dda*, while the other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River. The Farakka barrage over the Ganges feeds the Hooghly branch of the river by a feeder canal. Its water flow management has been a source of lingering dispute between India and Bangladesh.[93] The Teesta, Torsa, Jaldhaka and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region. The western plateau region has rivers like the Damodar, Ajay and Kangsabati. The Ganges delta and the Sundarbans area have numerous rivers and creeks. Pollution of the Ganges from indiscriminate waste dumped into the river is a major problem.[94] Damodar, another tributary of the Ganges and once known as the \"Sorrow of Bengal\" (due to its frequent floods), has several dams under the Damodar Valley Project. At least nine districts in the state suffer from arsenic contamination of groundwater, and as of 2017 an estimated 1.04\u00a0crore people were afflicted by arsenic poisoning.[95]\n\n\nWest Bengal's climate varies from tropical savanna in the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north. The main seasons are summer, the rainy season, a short autumn and winter. While the summer in the delta region is noted for excessive humidity, the western highlands experience a dry summer like northern India. The highest daytime temperatures range from 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F) to 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F).[96] At night, a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal. In early summer, brief squalls and thunderstorms known as *Kalbaisakhi*, or Nor'westers, often occur.[97] West Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Ocean monsoon that moves in a southeast to northwest direction. Monsoons bring rain to the whole state from June to September. Heavy rainfall of above 250 centimetres (98\u00a0in) is observed in the Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Cooch Behar district. During the arrival of the monsoons, low pressure in the Bay of Bengal region often leads to the formation of storms in the coastal areas. Winter (December\u2013January) is mild over the plains with average minimum temperatures of 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F).[96] A cold and dry northern wind blows in the winter, substantially lowering the humidity level. The Darjeeling Himalayan Hill region experiences a harsh winter, with occasional snowfall.[98]\n\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of a Bengal Tiger](image)\nA Royal Bengal tiger\n![Photograph of a Sal tree](image)\nSal trees in the Arabari forest in West Midnapur\n\nThe \"India State of Forest Report 2017\", recorded forest area in the state is 16,847\u00a0km2 (6,505\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[99][100] while in 2013, forest area was 16,805\u00a0km2 (6,488\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which was 18.93% of the state's geographical area, compared to the then national average of 21.23%.[101] Reserves and protected and unclassed forests constitute 59.4%, 31.8% and 8.9%, respectively, of forested areas, as of 2009.[102] Part of the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans in southern West Bengal.[103]\n\n\nFrom a phytogeographic viewpoint, the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans.[104] The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile.[104] Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand.[104] The predominant commercial tree species is *Shorea robusta*, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the *Casuarina*. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous *sundari* (*Heritiera fomes*), from which the forest gets its name.[105]\n\n\nThe distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation. For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the *Dooars*, are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees.[106] Above an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300\u00a0ft), the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above 1,500 metres (4,900\u00a0ft), temperate forest trees like oaks, conifers and rhododendrons predominate.[106]\n\n\n3.26% of the geographical area of West Bengal is protected land, comprising fifteen wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks\u2014Sundarbans National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve, Gorumara National Park, Neora Valley National Park and Singalila National Park.[102] Extant wildlife includes Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, leopard, gaur, tiger and crocodiles, as well as many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter.[107] The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, chinkara, takin, serow, pangolin, minivet and kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project devoted to conserving the endangered Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile.[108] The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal.[108] Recognising its special conservation value, the Sundarbans area has been declared a Biosphere Reserve.[102]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of West Bengal and Politics of West Bengal\n\nSee also: Council of Ministers of West Bengal and List of Chief Ministers of West Bengal\n\nWest Bengal is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the Head of State appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 members, or MLAs,[109] including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved before the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as *panchayats*, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha[110] and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.[111]\n\n\nPolitics in West Bengal is dominated by the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress (INC), and the Left Front alliance (led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)). Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power with 225 seats in the legislature.[112]\n\n\nPrior to this, West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years (1977\u20132011), making it the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government.[69] Banerjee was re-elected twice as Chief Minister in the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election and 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election with 211 and 215 seats respectively, an absolute majority by the Trinamool Congress.[113] The state has one autonomous region, the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration.[114]\n\n\n\nMain offices in West Bengal\n![](image)\nRaj Bhavan, the residence of the governor of the state\n![](image)\nWest Bengal Legislative Assembly\n![](image)\nCalcutta High Court, highest court in West Bengal\n![](image)\nNabanna, temporary office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal\n![](image)\nWriters' Building, West Bengal Government Secretariat\n\n## Districts and cities[edit]\n\n\n### Districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of West Bengal\n\n![](image)Districts of West Bengal\n![](image)A hut in a village in the Hooghly district\nAs of 1 November 2023, West Bengal is divided into 23 districts.[115]\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| District | Population | Growth rate | Sex ratio | Literacy | Density per square Kilometer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North 24 Parganas | 10,009,781 | 12.04 | 955 | 84.06 | 2445\n |\n| South 24 Parganas | 8,161,961 | 18.17 | 956 | 77.51 | 819\n |\n| Purba Bardhaman | 4,835,432 | \u2013 | 945 | 74.73 | 890\n |\n| Paschim Bardhaman | 2,882,031 | \u2013 | 922 | 78.75 | 1800\n |\n| Murshidabad | 7,103,807 | 21.09 | 958 | 66.59 | 1334\n |\n| West Midnapore | 5,913,457 | 13.86 | 966 | 78.00 | 631\n |\n| Hooghly | 5,519,145 | 9.46 | 961 | 81.80 | 1753\n |\n| Nadia | 5,167,600 | 12.22 | 947 | 74.97 | 1316\n |\n| East Midnapore | 5,095,875 | 15.36 | 938 | 87.02 | 1081\n |\n| Howrah | 4,850,029 | 13.50 | 939 | 83.31 | 3306\n |\n| Kolkata | 4,496,694 | \u22121.67 | 908 | 86.31 | 24306\n |\n| Maldah | 3,988,845 | 21.22 | 944 | 61.73 | 1069\n |\n| Jalpaiguri | 3,872,846 | 13.87 | 953 | 73.25 | 622\n |\n| Alipurduar[a] | 1,700,000 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 400\n |\n| Bankura | 3,596,292 | 12.64 | 954 | 70.95 | 523\n |\n| Birbhum | 3,502,404 | 16.15 | 956 | 70.68 | 771\n |\n| North Dinajpur | 3,007,134 | 23.15 | 939 | 59.07 | 958\n |\n| Purulia | 2,930,115 | 15.52 | 957 | 64.48 | 468\n |\n| Cooch Behar | 2,819,086 | 13.71 | 942 | 74.78 | 832\n |\n| Darjeeling | 1,846,823 | 14.77 | 970 | 79.56 | 586\n |\n| Dakshin Dinajpur | 1,676,276 | 11.52 | 956 | 72.82 | 755\n |\n| Kalimpong[a] | 202,239 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 270\n |\n| Jhargram[a] | 1,136,548 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | 374\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Was created after the 2011 Census\n\nEach district is governed by a district collector or district magistrate, appointed by either the Indian Administrative Service or the West Bengal Civil Service.[116] Each district is subdivided into sub-divisions, governed by a Sub-Divisional Magistrate, and again into blocks.

The growth rate was 12.62% in 2014\u20132015.[126]\n\n\nIn 2015\u20132016, the percentage share of Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by economic activity at the constant price (the base year 2011\u20132012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery\u20144.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It has been observed that there has been a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years.[127] Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane and wheat are the state's top five crops.[128]:\u200a14 Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high-quality teas.[128]:\u200a14 State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia Port region.[129] The Durgapur-Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of steel plants.[129] Important manufacturing industries include: engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established several industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in nearby areas have made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.[130]\n\n\nYears after independence, West Bengal is dependent on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, there has been a significant increase in food production since the 1980s and the state now has a surplus of grains.[131] The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980\u20131981, declining to 5% by 1997\u20131998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.[131] The state's total financial debt stood at \u20b91,918,350 million (US$23\u00a0billion) as of 2011.[132]\n\n\n\n![Brown jute sticks stacked in groups with small green saplings of rice in the foreground](image)Freshly sown saplings of rice in a paddy; in the background are stacks of jute sticks.\nIn the period 2004\u20132010, the average gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rate was 13.9% (calculated in Indian rupee terms) lower than 15.5%, the average for all states of the country.[128]:\u200a4\n\n\nThe economy of West Bengal has witnessed many surprising changes in direction. The agricultural sector in particular rose to 8.33% in 2010\u201311 before tumbling to \u22124.01% in 2012\u201313.[133] Many major industries such as the Uttarpara Hindustan Motors car manufacturing unit, the jute industry, and the Haldia Petrochemicals unit experienced shutdowns in 2014. In the same year, plans for a 300\u00a0billion Jindal Steel project was mothballed. The tea industry of West Bengal has also witnessed shutdowns for financial and political reasons.[134] The tourism industry of West Bengal was negatively impacted in 2017 because of the Gorkhaland agitation.[135]\n\n\nHowever, over the years due to effective changes in the stance towards industrialisation, ease of doing business has improved in West Bengal.[136][137][138] Steps are being taken to remedy this situation by promoting West Bengal as an investment destination. A leather complex has been built in Kolkata. Smart cities are being planned close to Kolkata, and major roadway projects are in the offing to revive the economy.[139] West Bengal has been able to attract 2% of the foreign direct investment in the last decade.[140]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in West Bengal and List of airports in West Bengal\n\n* ![Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport is a hub for flights to and from Bangladesh, East Asia, Nepal, Bhutan and north-east India.](image)\n\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport is a hub for flights to and from Bangladesh, East Asia, Nepal, Bhutan and north-east India.\n* ![Durgapur Expressway](image)\n\nDurgapur Expressway\n* ![An SBSTC bus in Karunamoyee](image)\n\nAn SBSTC bus in Karunamoyee\n* ![Kolkata Metro, India's first metro rail system](image)\n\nKolkata Metro, India's first metro rail system\n\n\nAs of 2011, the total length of surface roads in West Bengal was over 92,023 kilometres (57,180 miles);[128]:\u200a18 national highways comprise 2,578\u00a0km (1,602\u00a0mi)[141] and state highways 2,393\u00a0km (1,487\u00a0mi).[128]:\u200a18 As of 2006, the road density of the state was 103.69 kilometres per square kilometre (166.87 miles per square mile), higher than the national average of 74.7\u00a0km/km2 (120.2\u00a0mi/sq\u00a0mi).[142]\n\n\nAs of 2011, the total railway route length was around 4,481\u00a0km (2,784\u00a0mi).[128]:\u200a20 Kolkata is the headquarters of three zones of the Indian Railways\u2014Eastern Railway and South Eastern Railway and the Kolkata Metro, which is the newly formed 17th\u00a0zone of the Indian Railways.[143][144] The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) serves the northern parts of the state. The Kolkata metro is the country's first underground railway.[145] The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, part of NFR, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[146]\n\n\nNetaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Dum Dum, Kolkata, is the state's largest airport. Bagdogra Airport near Siliguri is a customs airport that offers international service to Bhutan and Thailand, besides regular domestic service. Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport, India's first private sector airport, serves the twin cities of Asansol-Durgapur at Andal, Paschim Bardhaman.[147][148]\n\n\nKolkata is a major river port in eastern India. The Kolkata Port Trust manages the Kolkata and the Haldia docks.[149] There is passenger service to Port Blair on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Cargo ship service operates to ports in India and abroad, operated by the Shipping Corporation of India. Ferries are a principal mode of transport in the southern part of the state, especially in the Sundarbans area. Kolkata is the only city in India to have trams as a mode of transport; these are operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company.[150]\n\n\nSeveral government-owned organisations operate bus services in the state, including: the Calcutta State Transport Corporation, the North Bengal State Transport Corporation, the South Bengal State Transport Corporation, the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation and the Calcutta Tramways Company.[151] There are also private bus companies. The railway system is a nationalised service without any private investment.[152] Hired forms of transport include metered taxis and auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes in cities. In most of the state, cycle rickshaws and in Kolkata, hand-pulled rickshaws and electric rickshaws are used for short-distance travel.[153]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDakshineswar Kali Temple\n![](image)\nTipu Sultan Mosque\n![](image)\nSt Paul's Cathedral\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  1901  | 16,940,088 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  1911  | 17,998,769 | +6.2% |\n|  1921  | 17,474,348 | \u22122.9% |\n|  1931  | 18,897,036 | +8.1% |\n|  1941  | 23,229,552 | +22.9% |\n|  1951  | 26,300,000 | +13.2% |\n|  1961  | 34,926,000 | +32.8% |\n|  1971  | 44,312,000 | +26.9% |\n|  1981  | 54,581,000 | +23.2% |\n|  1991  | 68,078,000 | +24.7% |\n|  2001  | 80,176,000 | +17.8% |\n|  2011  | 91,276,115 | +13.8% |\n|  2022 | 98,604,000 | +8.0% |\n| Source: Census of India[154] |\n\n\nAccording to the provisional results of the 2011 national census, West Bengal is the fourth-most-populous state in India with a population of 91,347,736 (7.55% of India's population).[3] The state's 2001\u20132011 decennial population growth rate was 13.93%,[3] lower than the 1991\u20132001 growth rate of 17.8%[3] and lower than the national rate of 17.64%.[155] The gender ratio is 947 females per 1,000 males.[155] As of 2011, West Bengal had a population density of 1,029 inhabitants per square kilometre (2,670/sq\u00a0mi) making it the second-most densely populated state in India, after Bihar.[155]\n\n\nThe literacy rate is 77.08%, higher than the national rate of 74.04%.[156] Data from 2010 to 2014 showed the life expectancy in the state was 70.2 years, higher than the national value of 67.9.[157][158] The proportion of people living below the poverty line in 2013 was 19.98%, a decline from 31.8% a decade ago.[159] Scheduled castes and tribes form 28.6% and 5.8% of the population, respectively, in rural areas and 19.9% and 1.5%, respectively, in urban areas.[131]\n\n\nIn September 2017, West Bengal achieved 100% electrification, after some remote villages in the Sunderbans became the last to be electrified.[160]\n\n\nAs of September 2017, of 125 towns and cities in Bengal, 76 have achieved open defecation free (ODF) status. All towns in the districts of: Nadia, North 24 Parganas, Hooghly, Bardhaman and East Medinipur are ODF zones, with Nadia becoming the first ODF district in the state in April 2015.[161][162]\n\n\nA study conducted in three districts of West Bengal found that accessing private health services to treat illness had a catastrophic impact on households. This indicates the importance of the public provision of health services to mitigate poverty and the impact of illness on poor households.[163]\n\n\nThe latest Sample Registration System (SRS) statistical report shows that West Bengal has the lowest fertility rate among Indian states. West Bengal's total fertility rate was 1.6, lower than neighbouring Bihar's 3.4, which is the highest in the entire country. Bengal's TFR of 1.6 roughly equals that of Canada.[164]\n\n\nBengalis, consisting of Bengali Hindus, Bengali Muslims, Bengali Christians and a few Bengali Buddhists, comprise the majority of the population.[165] Marwari, Maithili and Bhojpuri speakers are scattered throughout the state; various indigenous ethnic Buddhist communities such as the Sherpas, Bhutias, Lepchas, Tamangs, Yolmos and ethnic Tibetans can be found in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region. Native Khortha speakers are found in Malda district.[166]\n\n\nSurjapuri, a language considered to be a mix of Maithili and Bengali, is spoken across northern parts of the state.[167] The Darjeeling Hills are mainly inhabited by various Gorkha communities who overwhelmingly speak Nepali (also known as Gorkhali), although there are some who retain their ancestral languages like Lepcha. West Bengal is also home to indigenous tribal Adivasis such as: Santhal, Munda, Oraon, Bhumij, Lodha, Kol and Toto.\n\n\nThere are a small number of ethnic minorities primarily in the state capital, including\u00a0: Chinese, Tamils, Maharashtrians, Odias, Malayalis, Gujaratis, Anglo-Indians, Armenians, Jews, Punjabis and Parsis.[168] India's sole Chinatown is in eastern Kolkata.[169]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nLanguages of West Bengal (2011)[170]\n\n\n\nBengali (86.22%)\nHindi (6.97%)\nSantali (2.66%)\nUrdu (1.82%)\nNepali (1.27%)\nOthers (1.06%)\n\nThe state's official languages are Bengali and English;[4] Nepali has additional official status in the three subdivisions of Darjeeling district.[4] In 2012, the state government passed a bill granting additional official status to Hindi, Odia, Punjabi, Santali and Urdu in areas where speakers exceed 10% of the population.[4] In 2019, another bill was passed by the government to include Kamtapuri, Kurmali and Rajbanshi as additional official languages in blocks, divisions or districts where the speakers exceed 10% of the population.[4] On 24 December 2020, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced Telugu as an additional official language.[4] As of the 2011 census, 86.22% of the population spoke Bengali, 5.00% Hindi, 2.66% Santali, 1.82% Urdu and 1.26% Nepali as their first language.[170]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in West Bengal\n\nReligion in West Bengal (2011)[171]\n\n\n\nHinduism (70.54%)\nIslam (27.01%)\nChristianity (0.72%)\nBuddhism (0.31%)\nNo religion (0.25%)\nJainism (0.07%)\nSikhism (0.07%)\nOther Religions (inc. Tribal religions, Judaism and Zoroastrianism) (1.03%)\n\nWest Bengal is religiously diverse, with regional cultural and religious specificities. Although Hindus are the predominant community, the state has a large minority Muslim population. Christians, Buddhists and others form a minuscule part of the population. As of 2011, Hinduism is the most common religion, with adherents representing 70.54% of the total population.[172] Muslims, the second-largest community, comprise 27.01% of the total population,[173] Three of West Bengal's districts: Murshidabad, Malda and Uttar Dinajpur, are Muslim-majority. Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism and other religions make up the remainder.[174] Buddhism remains a prominent religion in the Himalayan region of the Darjeeling hills; almost the entirety of West Bengal's Buddhist population is from this region.[175] Christianity is mainly found among the tea garden tribes at tea plantations scattered throughout the Dooars of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts.\n\n\nThe Hindu population of West Bengal is 64,385,546 while the Muslim population is 24,654,825, according to the 2011 census.[176]\n\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bengalis, Culture of West Bengal, and Culture of Darjeeling\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bengali literature and History of Bengali literature\n\n![Portrait of Rabindranath Tagore](image)\nRabindranath Tagore is Asia's first Nobel laureate and the composer of India's national anthem.\n![A portrait of Swami Vivekanada](image)\nSwami Vivekananda was a key figure in introducing Vedanta and Yoga to Europe and the US,[177] raising interfaith awareness and making Hinduism a world religion.[178]\n\nThe Bengali language boasts a rich literary heritage it shares with neighbouring Bangladesh. West Bengal has a long tradition of folk literature, evidenced by the *Charyapada*, a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th\u00a0centuries; *Mangalkavya*, a collection of Hindu narrative poetry composed around the 13th\u00a0century; *Shreekrishna Kirtana*, a pastoral Vaishnava drama in verse composed by Boru Chandidas; *Thakurmar Jhuli*, a collection of Bengali folk and fairy tales compiled by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder; and stories of Gopal Bhar, a court jester in medieval Bengal. In the 19th and 20th\u00a0centuries, Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period;[179] Michael Madhusudan Dutt, a pioneer in Bengali drama who introduced the use of blank verse;[180] and Rabindranath Tagore, who reshaped Bengali literature and music. Indian art saw the introduction of Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th\u00a0centuries.[181] Other notable figures include Kazi Nazrul Islam, whose compositions form the avant-garde genre of *Nazrul Sangeet*,[182] Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works on contemporary social practices in Bengal are widely acclaimed,[183] and Manik Bandyopadhyay, who is considered one of the leading lights of modern Bengali fiction.[184] In modern times, Jibanananda Das has been acknowledged as \"the premier poet of the post-Tagore era in India\".[185] Other writers include: Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, best known for his work *Pather Panchali*; Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, well known for his portrayal of the lower strata of society;[186] Manik Bandopadhyay, a pioneering novelist; and Ashapurna Devi, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Buddhadeb Guha, Mahashweta Devi, Samaresh Majumdar, Sanjeev Chattopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay, Buddhadeb Basu,[187] Joy Goswami and Sunil Gangopadhyay.[188][189]\n\n\n\n### Music and dance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of West Bengal\n\n![](image)\nBaul singers at Basanta-Utsab, Shantiniketan\n![](image)\nDance with Rabindra Sangeet\n\n![](image)Chhau Dance\nA notable music tradition is the Baul music, practised by the Bauls, a sect of mystic minstrels.[190] Other folk music forms include Gombhira and Bhawaiya. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, a one-stringed instrument. Shyama Sangeet is a genre of devotional songs, praising the Hindu goddess Kali; kirtan is devotional group songs dedicated to the god Krishna.[191] Like other states in northern India, West Bengal also has a heritage in North Indian classical music. Rabindrasangeet, songs composed and set to words by Rabindranath Tagore, and Nazrul geeti (by Kazi Nazrul Islam) are popular. Also prominent are Dwijendralal, Atulprasad and Rajanikanta's songs, and *adhunik* or modern music from films and other composers.[192] From the early 1990s, new genres of music have emerged, including what has been called Bengali *Jeebonmukhi Gaan* (a modern genre based on realism). Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. Chhau dance of Purulia is a rare form of masked dance.[193]\n\n\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of West Bengal\n\n![Photograph of Satyajit Ray seated with Ravi Shankar with several others in the background](image)Satyajit Ray, a pioneer in Bengali cinema along with Ravi Sankar.\nWest Bengali films are shot mostly in studios in the Kolkata neighbourhood of Tollygunge; the name \"Tollywood\" (similar to Hollywood and Bollywood) is derived from that name. The Bengali film industry is well known for its art films, and has produced acclaimed directors like Satyajit Ray who is widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century,[194] Mrinal Sen whose films were known for their artistic depiction of social reality, Tapan Sinha,[195] and Ritwik Ghatak. Some contemporary directors include veterans such as: Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Tarun Majumdar, Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen, and Rituparno Ghosh, and a newer pool of directors such as Kaushik Ganguly and Srijit Mukherji.[196][197][198] Uttam Kumar was the most popular lead actor for decades, and his romantic pairing with actress Suchitra Sen in films attained legendary status.[199] Soumitra Chatterjee, who acted in many Satyajit Ray-films, and Prosenjit Chatterjee are among other popular lead male actors. As of 2020[update], Bengali films have won India's annual National Film Award for Best Feature Film twenty-two times in sixty seven years, the highest among all Indian languages.\n\n\n\n### Fine arts[edit]\n\n\n![Panchura Temple made from terracotta](image)Panchchura Temple in Bishnupur, one of the older examples of the terracotta arts of India.\nThere are significant examples of fine arts in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings. Bengal has been in the vanguard of modernism in fine arts. Abanindranath Tagore, called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration. The movement had many adherents, including: Gaganendranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Jamini Roy and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.[200][201]\n\n\n\n### Reformist heritage[edit]\n\n\nThe capital, Kolkata, was the workplace of several social reformers, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda. Their social reforms eventually led to a cultural atmosphere that made it possible for practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or untouchability, to be abolished.[202] The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Prabhupada and Paramahansa Yogananda.[202]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of West Bengal\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAssorted food eaten in West Bengal: *Patisapta*, a kind of pitha; shorshe ilish (hilsha with mustard sauce) and rasgullas in sugar syrup\n\nRice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, \"*machhe bhate bangali*\", that translates as \"fish and rice make a Bengali\".[203] Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favourite among Bengalis. There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on its texture, size, fat content and bones.[204] Most of the people also consume eggs, chicken, mutton, and shrimp. *Panta bhat* (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas.[205] Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen include cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies and turmeric.[206] Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including *R\u00f4shogolla*, *Ch\u00f4mch\u00f4m*, *Kalojam* and several kinds of *sondesh*. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread, or dim sum, are specialties of the winter season. Sweets such as *narkol-naru*, *til-naru*, *moa* and *payesh* are prepared during festivals such as Lakshmi puja.[207] Popular street foods include Aloor Chop, Beguni, Kati roll, biryani, and phuchka.[208][209]\n\n\n\n### Clothing[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of a woman wearing a red Jamdani sari](image)Jamdani Sari of Bangladesh is very popular in West Bengal.\nBengali women commonly wear the *sari*, often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear western attire. Among men, western dress has greater acceptance. Particularly on cultural occasions, men also wear traditional costumes such as the *panjabi* with *dhuti* while women wear *salwar kameez* or *sari*.[210]\n\n\nWest Bengal produces several varieties of cotton and silk *saris* in the country. Handlooms are a popular way for the state's rural population to earn a living through weaving. Every district has weaving clusters, which are home to artisan communities, each specialising in specific varieties of handloom weaving. Notable handloom saris include *tant*, *jamdani*, *garad*, *korial*, *baluchari*, *tussar* and muslin.[211]\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of festivals in West Bengal\n\nDurga Puja is the biggest, most popular and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal.[212] The five-day-long colourful Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state. Pandals are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout West Bengal. The city of Kolkata transforms Durga Puja. It is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped. The idols of the goddess are brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival. Today people of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds partake in the festivities.[213] On Vijayadashami, the last day of the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being immersed into the rivers.[214]\n\n\nRath Yatra is a Hindu festival which celebrates Jagannath, a form of Krishna. It is celebrated with much fanfare in Kolkata as well as in rural Bengal. Images of Jagannath are set upon a chariot and pulled through the streets.[215]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKaram festival in Jhargram\nFestivals of West Bengal: Durga Puja, Rath Yatra and Goddess Saraswati dressed in a yellow sari on Saraswati Puja\n\nOther major festivals of West Bengal include: Poila Baishakh the Bengali new year, Dolyatra or Holi the festival of lights, Poush Parbon, Kali Puja, Nabadwip Shakta Rash, Saraswati Puja, Deepavali, Lakshmi Puja, Janmashtami, Jagaddhatri Puja, Vishwakarma Puja, Bhai Phonta, Rakhi Bandhan, Kalpataru Day, Shivratri, Ganesh Chathurthi, Maghotsav, Karam festival, Kartik Puja, Akshay Tritiya, Raas Yatra, Guru Purnima, Annapurna Puja, Charak Puja, Gajan, Buddha Purnima, Christmas, Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha and Muharram. Rabindra Jayanti, Kolkata Book Fair, Kolkata Film Festival, and Nazrul Jayanti. All are important cultural events.[215]\n\n\nEid al-Fitr is the most important Muslim festival in West Bengal. They celebrate the end of Ramadan with prayers, alms-giving, shopping, gift-giving, and feasting.[216]\n\n\nChristmas, called *B\u00f4\u0157odin* (Great day) is perhaps the next major festival celebrated in Kolkata, after Durga Puja. Although Hinduism is the major religion in the state, people show significant passion to the festival. Just like Durga Puja, Christmas in Kolkata is an occasion when all communities and people of every religion take part. Large masses of people go to parks, gardens, museums, parties, fairs, churches and other places to celebrate the day. A lot of Hindus go to Hindu-temples and the festival is celebrated there too with Hindu rituals.[217][218] The state tourism department organises a gala Christmas Festival every year in Park Street.[219] The whole of Park Street is hung with colourful lights, and food stalls sell cakes, chocolates, Chinese cuisine, momo, and various other items. The state invites musical groups from Darjeeling and other North East India states to perform choir recitals, carols, and jazz numbers.[220]\n\n\nBuddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha, is one of the most important Hindu/Buddhist festivals and is celebrated with much gusto in the Darjeeling hills. On this day, processions begin at the various Buddhist monasteries, or *gumpas*, and congregate at the Chowrasta (Darjeeling) Mall. The Lamas chant mantras and sound their bugles, and students, as well as people from every community, carry the holy books or *pustaks* on their heads. Besides Buddha Purnima, Dashain, or Dusshera, Holi, Diwali, Losar, Namsoong or the Lepcha New Year, and Losoong are the other major festivals of the Darjeeling Himalayan region.[216]\n\n\nEach year between July and August (on the eve of the month of Shravan) in Tarakeswar Yatra held, nearly 10 million devotees come from various part of India bringing holy water of Ganga from Nimai Tirtha Ghat of Baidyabati, which is almost 39\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) from Tarakeswar, in order to offer it to Lord Shiva.
