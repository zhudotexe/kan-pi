In the 2021 Census, roughly 81% of the population were ethnic Russians, 19% of the population were ethnic minorities.[fn 1][17] According to the United Nations, Russia's immigrant population is the world's third largest, numbering over 11.6 million; most of whom are from other post-Soviet states.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the latest Rosstat vital statistics[19] and the World Population Review in 2019.[20]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 22 seconds[19]\n* One death every 13 seconds[19]\n* Net loss of one person every 30 seconds[19]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

There were twice as many deaths as there were births, deaths were 584,700 people.[32] The birth rate was 8.9 new babies per 100,000 inhabitants, the lowest crude birth rate since the year 2000.[32]\n\n\nRussia has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world with 1.42 children per woman in 2022, below 2.1 children per woman, which must be the number reached in order to maintain its population.[32] As a result of their low fertility for decades, the Russian population is one of the oldest in the world with an average of 40.3 years.[32]\n\n\n\n### Historical fertility rates[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born to each woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period.

The annexation is internationally recognized only by North Korea.\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Russia\n\nIn 2006, in a bid to compensate for the country's demographic decline, the Russian government started simplifying immigration laws.[*citation needed*] New citizenship rules introduced in April 2014 allowing eligible citizens from former Soviet republics to obtain Russian citizenship, have gained strong interest among Russian-speaking residents of those countries (i.e. Russians, Germans, Belarusians and Ukrainians).[48][49]\n\n\nThere are an estimated four million undocumented immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia.[50] In 2012, the Russian Federal Security Service's Border Service stated there had been an increase in undocumented migration from the Middle East and Southeast Asia (Note that these were Temporary Contract Migrants)[51] Under legal changes made in 2012, undocumented immigrants who are caught will be banned from reentering the country for 10 years.[52][53]\n\n\nSince the collapse of the USSR, most immigrants have come from Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Belarus, from poor areas of China, and from Vietnam and Laos.[54]\n\n\n\n### Worker migration[edit]\n\n\nTemporary migrant workers in Russia consists of about 7 million people, most of the temporary workers come from Central Asia (mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan), South Caucasus (mostly from Armenia and Azerbaijan), East Asia (mostly from poor areas of China, from Vietnam and Laos). Most of them work in the construction, cleaning and in the household industries. They primarily live in cities such as Moscow, Sochi and Blagoveshchensk. The mayor of Moscow said that Moscow cannot do without worker migrants. New laws are in place that require worker migrants to be fluent in Russian, know Russian history and laws.\n\n\n\n## Emigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Russian diaspora\n\nSee also: Russian emigration following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine\n\nSee also: Fourth-wave Russian emigration\n\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to considerable emigration, with over 300,000 Russian citizens and residents are estimated to have left Russia by mid-March 2022, at least 500,000 by the end of August 2022,[55] and an additional 400,000 by early October. The total number of political refugees, economic migrants, and conscientious objectors[56][57][58][59][60] is thought to be more than 900,000. In addition to evading criminal prosecution for opposing the invasion, and fear of being conscripted after President Vladimir Putin's 21 September 2022 announcement of partial mobilization, those fleeing voiced reasons such as disagreement with the war, the uselessness and cruelty of the war, sympathy for Ukraine, disagreement with the political roots of the war with Ukraine, the rejection of killing, and an assessment that Russia is no longer the place for their family.[61]\n\n\n\n## Occupied and annexed regions[edit]\n\n\nRussia has encouraged or even forced people in occupied or annexed regions to become Russian citizens, a procedure known as passportization. This includes the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts of Ukraine,[62] and South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia.[63]\n\n\n\n## Employment and income[edit]\n\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15–24\n\ntotal: 12%. Country comparison to the world: 72rd\nmale: 15.3%\nfemale: 16.9% (2015 est.)\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Russia\n\n![](image)Metallurg, a Soviet-era sanatorium in Sochi[64]\nRussia's constitution guarantees free, universal health care for all Russian citizens, through a compulsory state health insurance program.[65] The Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation oversees the Russian public healthcare system, and the sector employs more than two million people. Federal regions also have their own departments of health that oversee local administration. A separate private health insurance plan is needed to access private healthcare in Russia.[66]\n\n\nRussia spent 5.32% of its GDP on healthcare in 2018.[67] Its healthcare expenditure is notably lower than other developed nations.[68] Russia has one of the world's most female-biased sex ratios, with 0.859 males to every female,[13] due to its high male mortality rate.[69] In 2019, the overall life expectancy in Russia at birth was 73.2 years (68.2 years for males and 78.0 years for females),[70] and it had a very low infant mortality rate (5 per 1,000 live births).[71]\n\n\nThe principal causes of death in Russia are cardiovascular diseases.[72] Obesity is a prevalent health issue in Russia; 61.1% of Russian adults were overweight or obese in 2016.[73] However, Russia's historically high alcohol consumption rate is the biggest health issue in the country,[74][75] as it remains one of the world's highest, despite a stark decrease in the last decade.[76] Smoking is another health issue in the country.[77] The country's high suicide rate, although on the decline,[78] remains a significant social issue.[79]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Russia\n\nRussia had one of the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Analysis of excess deaths from official government demographic statistics, based on births and deaths and excluding migration, showed that Russia had its biggest ever annual population drop in peacetime, with the population declining by 997,000 between October 2020 and September 2021, which demographer Alexei Raksha interpreted as being primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[25]\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Russia\n\nEthnic groups in Russia\n![](image)\nEthnic groups in Russia of more than 1 million people in 2010\n![](image)\nPercentage of ethnic Russians by region in 2021 (excluding non-stated ethnicity people)\n\nRussia is a multinational state, with many subnational entities associated with different minorities.[16] There are over 193 ethnic groups nationwide. In the 2021 census, roughly 81% of the population were ethnic Russians, and the remaining 19% of the population were ethnic minorities.[17] In 2010, four-fifths of Russia's population originated from West of the Ural Mountains — of which the vast majority were Slavs,[80] with a substantial minority of Finnic and Germanic peoples.[81][82] Turkic peoples form a large minority, and are spread around pockets across the vast nation.[83] Various distinct ethnic groups also inhabit the North Caucasus.[84] Other minorities include Mongolian peoples (Buryats and Kalmyks),[85][86] the Indigenous peoples of Siberia,[87] a historical Jewish population,[88] and the Koryo-saram (including Sakhalin Koreans).[89]\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Russia's immigrant population is the third-largest in the world, numbering over 11.6 million in 2016;[18] most of which are from post-Soviet states, mainly Ukrainians.[90] There are 22 republics in Russia, who have their own ethnicities, cultures, and languages. In 12 of them in 2021, ethnic Russians constitute a minority:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic Russian-minority regions in Russia in 2021\n |\n| --- |\n| Republic | ethnic Russians (%)\n |\n| Bashkortostan | 37.5%\n |\n| Chechnya | 1.2%\n |\n| Chuvashia | 30.7%\n |\n| Dagestan | 3.3%\n |\n| Ingushetia | 0.7%\n |\n| Kabardino-Balkaria | 19.8%\n |\n| Kalmykia | 25.7%\n |\n| Karachay-Cherkessia | 27.5%\n |\n| North Ossetia–Alania | 18.9%\n |\n| Yakutia | 32.6%\n |\n| Tatarstan | 40.3%\n |\n| Tuva | 10.1%\n |\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Russian language and Languages of Russia\n\nSee also: List of endangered languages in Russia\n\nMinority languages across Russia\n![](image)\nAltaic and Uralic languages spoken across Russia\n![](image)\nThe North Caucasus is ethno-linguistically diverse.[91][92]\n\nRussian is the official and the predominantly spoken language in Russia. It is the most spoken native language in Europe, the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia, as well as the world's most widely spoken Slavic language.[93] Russian is the second-most used language on the Internet after English,[94] and is one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station,[95] as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations.[93]\n\n\nRussia is a multilingual nation; approximately 100–150 minority languages are spoken across the country.[96][97] According to the Russian Census of 2002, 142.6 million across the country spoke Russian, 5.3 million spoke Tatar, and 1.8 million spoke Ukrainian.[98] The constitution allows the country's individual republics the right to establish their own state languages in addition to Russian, as well as guarantee its citizens the right to preserve their native language and to create conditions for its study and development.[99] However, various experts have claimed Russia's linguistic diversity is rapidly declining.[100][101]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Russia\n\nFurther information: Russian Orthodox Church, Christianity in Russia, Islam in Russia, and Buddhism in Russia\n\nReligion in Russia (2012)[102]\n\n\n\nOrthodox Christianity (42.5%)\nUnaffiliated Christians (4.1%)\nOther Christians[a] (0.5%)\nSpiritual but not religious (25%)\nAtheists (13%)\nMuslims[b] (6.5%)\nPagans[c] (1.3%)\nBuddhists (0.5%)\nOther religions[d] (1.1%)\nUndeclared (5.5%)\n\n![](image)Annunciation Cathedral in Voronezh\nRussia is a secular state by constitution, and its largest religion is Christianity. It has the world's largest Orthodox population.[103][104] As of different sociological surveys on religious adherence, between 41% and over 80% of the total population of Russia adhere to the Russian Orthodox Church.[105][106][107] Other branches of Christianity present in Russia include Catholicism (approx. 1%), Baptists, Pentecostals, Lutherans and other Protestant churches (together totalling about 0.5% of the population) and Old Believers.[108][109] There is some presence of Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism; pagan beliefs are also present to some extent in remote areas, sometimes syncretized with one of the mainstream religions.\n\n\nIn 2017, a survey made by the Pew Research Center showed that 73% of Russians declared themselves as Christians—out of which 71% were Orthodox, 1% were Catholic, and 2% were Other Christians, while 15% were unaffiliated, 10% were Muslims, and 1% followed other religions.[110] According to various reports, the proportion of Atheists in Russia is between 16% and 48% of the population.[111]\n\n\nIslam is the second-largest religion in Russia, and it is the traditional religion amongst most peoples of the North Caucasus, and amongst some Turkic peoples scattered along the Volga-Ural region.[112] Buddhists have a sizable population in three Siberian republics: Buryatia, Tuva, and Zabaykalsky Krai, and in Kalmykia, the only region in Europe where Buddhism is the most practised religion.[113]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Russia\n\n![](image)Moscow State University, the most prestigious educational institution in Russia.[114]\nRussia has an adult literacy rate of 100%.[115] It grants free education to its citizens under its constitution.[116] The Ministry of Education of Russia is responsible for primary and secondary education, as well as vocational education; while the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia is responsible for science and higher education.[117] Regional authorities regulate education within their jurisdictions within the prevailing framework of federal laws. Russia is among the world's most educated countries, and has the third-highest proportion of tertiary-level graduates in terms of percentage of population, at 62%.[118] It spent roughly 4.7% of its GDP on education in 2018.[119]\n\n\nRussia has compulsory education for a duration of 11 years, exclusively for children aged 7 to 17–18.[117] Its pre-school education system is highly developed and optional,[120] some four-fifths of children aged 3 to 6 attend day nurseries or kindergartens. Primary school is compulsory for 11 year-olds, starting from age 6 to 7, and leads to a basic general education certificate.[117] An additional two or three years of schooling are required for the secondary-level certificate, and some seven-eighths of Russians continue their education past this level. Admission to an institute of higher education is selective and highly competitive:[116] first-degree courses usually take five years.[121] The oldest and largest universities in Russia are Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg State University.[122] There are ten highly prestigious federal universities across the country. Russia was the world's fifth-leading destination for international students in 2019, hosting roughly 300,000.[123]\n\n\n\n## Urbanized areas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities and towns in Russia by population and List of cities and towns in Russia\n\n* ![Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia](image)\n\nMoscow, the capital and largest city of Russia\n* ![Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-largest city](image)\n\nSaint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-largest city\n* ![Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in the country.](image)\n\nYekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in the country.\n\n\nRussia is one of the world's most urbanized countries, with roughly 75% of its total population living in urban areas.[13] Moscow, the capital and largest city, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits,[124] while over 17 million residents in the urban area,[125] and over 20 million residents in the metropolitan area.[126] Moscow is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe,[125] the most populous metropolitan area in Europe,[126] and also the largest city by land area on the European continent.[127] Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants.[128] Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk.\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in Russia2024 estimate[129]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Federal subject | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Federal subject | Pop. |  |\n| ![Moscow](image)Moscow![Saint Petersburg](image)Saint Petersburg | 1 | Moscow | Moscow | 13,149,803 | 11 | Rostov-on-Don | Rostov Oblast | 1,140,487\n | ![Novosibirsk](image)Novosibirsk![Yekaterinburg](image)Yekaterinburg |\n| 2 | Saint Petersburg | Saint Petersburg | 5,597,763 | 12 | Krasnodar | Krasnodar Krai | 1,138,654\n |\n| 3 | Novosibirsk | Novosibirsk Oblast | 1,633,851 | 13 | Omsk | Omsk Oblast | 1,104,485\n |\n| 4 | Yekaterinburg | Sverdlovsk Oblast | 1,536,183 | 14 | Voronezh | Voronezh Oblast | 1,046,425\n |\n| 5 | Kazan | Tatarstan | 1,318,604 | 15 | Perm | Perm Krai | 1,026,908\n |\n| 6 | Krasnoyarsk | Krasnoyarsk Krai | 1,205,473 | 16 | Volgograd | Volgograd Oblast | 1,018,898\n |\n| 7 | Nizhny Novgorod | Nizhny Novgorod Oblast | 1,204,985 | 17 | Saratov | Saratov Oblast | 887,365\n |\n| 8 | Chelyabinsk | Chelyabinsk Oblast | 1,177,058 | 18 | Tyumen | Tyumen Oblast | 861,098\n |\n| 9 | Ufa | Bashkortostan | 1,163,304 | 19 | Tolyatti | Samara Oblast | 667,956\n |\n| 10 | Samara | Samara Oblast | 1,158,952 | 20 | Makhachkala | Dagestan | 622,091\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographic history of Russia\n* Demographics of Siberia\n* Demographic crisis of Russia\n* List of federal subjects of Russia by total fertility rate\n* List of federal subjects of Russia by life expectancy\n* Genetic studies on Russians\n* Health in Russia\n* Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East\n* Russian cross\n* Russian nationality law\n\n\n**Census information:**\n\n\n\n* Soviet Census\n* Russian Empire Census (1897)\n* Russian Census (2002)\n* Russian Census (2010)\n* Russian Census (2021)\n* List of cities and towns in Russia by population\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** This is the proportional makeup of those that declared an ethnicity. 11.6% did not declare an ethncity so these figures should be treated with caution.\n2. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n\n1. **^** Including Old Believers (0.2%), Protestantism (0.2%), and Catholicism (0.1%).\n2. **^** The Sreda Arena Atlas 2012 did not count the populations of two Muslim-majority federal subjects of Russia, namely Chechnya and Ingushetia, which together had a population of nearly 2 million, thus the proportion of Muslims may be slightly underestimated.[102]\n3. **^** The category included Rodnovers accounting for 44%, Hinduists accounting for 0.1%; pagan religions and Siberian Tengrists and shamans account for the rest.[*citation needed*]\n4. **^** Including Judaism (0.1%) and other unspecified religions.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Including 2,482,450 people living in the annexed Crimea peninsula Том 1.

The 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure,[4] Between 2011 and May 2016, Canada's population grew by 1.7 million people, with immigrants accounting for two-thirds of the increase.[5] Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth.[6] The main driver of population growth is immigration, and to a lesser extent, natural growth.[7][8]\n\n\nCanada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[9] driven mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent, family reunification.[10][11] In 2021, a total of 405,330 immigrants were admitted to Canada, mainly from Asia.[12][13] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[14] Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees,[15] accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density of Canadian provinces and territories >25 people/km2\n 15–24.9 people/km2\n 10–14.9 people/km2\n 5–9.9 people/km2\n 1–4.9 people/km2\n <1 people/km2\n\nMain article: Population of Canada\n\nThe 2021 Canadian census had a total population count of 36,991,981 individuals, making up approximately 0.5% of the world's total population.[4][18] A population estimate for 2023 put the total number of people in Canada at 40,097,761.[19][20]\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[21]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minutes\n* One death every 2 minutes\n* One net migrant every 2 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 1 minute\n\n\nDeath rate\n\n\n\n8.12 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)

province[edit]\n\n\nAll citizens of Canada are classified as \"Canadians\" as defined by Canada's nationality laws. \"Canadian\" as an ethnic group has since 1996 been added to census questionnaires for possible ancestral origin or descent. \"Canadian\" was included as an example on the English questionnaire and \"Canadien\" as an example on the French questionnaire.[44] \"The majority of respondents to this selection are from the eastern part of the country that was first settled. Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage.[45][46]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Province / Territory | Percent Canadians\n | Total Canadians\n |\n| --- | --- | ---

(assumed for 1981 to 2016) population as a percentage of the total population over time\n![](image)Visible minorities over time including projections\n![](image)Visible minorities as a population pyramid in total in 2016\nAccording to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[47] The major panethnic groups chosen were; European (52.5%), North American (22.9%), Asian (19.3%), North American Indigenous (6.1%), African (3.8%), Latin, Central and South American (2.5%), Caribbean (2.1%), Oceanian (0.3%), and Other (6%).[47][48] Statistics Canada reports that 35.5% of the population reported multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100%.[47][b]\n\n\nThe country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[c] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).[51]\n\n\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021 approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8 percent of the population.[52][2] The indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021.[53] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[2][d] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent) and Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent).[52]\n\n\nAs data is completely self-reported, and reporting individuals may have varying definitions of \"Ethnic origin\" (or may not know their ethnic origin), these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethno-cultural ancestries but rather how Canadians self-identify.\n\n\nData from this section from Statistics Canada, 2021.[55]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic origin[56] | %\n |

Canada number 8.3 million persons and make up approximately 23 percent of Canada's total population.[75] This represents the eighth-largest immigrant population in the world, while the proportion represents one of the highest ratios for industrialized Western countries.[91]\n\n\nSince confederation in 1867 through to the contemporary era, decadal and demi-decadal census reports have detailed immigration statistics. During this period, the highest annual immigration rate in Canada occurred in 1913, when 400,900 new immigrants accounted for 5.3 percent of the total population,[92][93] while the greatest number of foreign-born individuals admitted to Canada in single year occurred in 2021, with 405,330 new immigrants accounting for 1.1 percent of the total population.\n\n\nStatistics Canada projects that immigrants will represent between 29.1% and 34.0% of Canada's population in 2041, compared with 23.0% in 2021,[94] while the Canadian population with at least one foreign born parent (first and second generation persons) could rise to between 49.8% and 54.3%, up from 44.0% in 2021.[2][73][74]\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada Immigration Statistics[95][96]: 239[97]: 108[98]\n| Year\n | Immigrant percentage\n | Immigrant population\n | Total responses\n | Total population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1871\n | 16.1%\n | 594,207\n | —\n | 3,689,257\n |\n| 1881\n | 13.9%\n | 602,984\n | —\n | 4,324,810\n |\n| 1891\n | 13.3%\n | 643,871\n | —\n | 4,833,239\n |\n| 1901\n | 13%\n | 699,500\n | —\n | 5,371,315\n |\n| 1911\n | 22%\n | 1,586,961\n | —\n | 7,206,643\n |\n| 1921\n | 22.3%\n | 1,955,736\n | —\n | 8,787,949\n |\n| 1931\n | 22.2%\n | 2,307,525\n | —\n | 10,374,196\n |\n| 1941\n | 17.5%\n | 2,018,847\n | —\n | 11,506,655\n |\n| 1951\n | 14.7%\n | 2,059,911\n | —\n | 14,009,429\n |\n| 1961\n | 15.6%\n | 2,844,263\n | —\n | 18,238,247\n |\n| 1971\n | 15.3%\n | 3,295,535\n | 21,568,310\n | 21,568,311\n |\n| 1981\n | 16%\n | 3,843,335\n | 24,083,495\n | 24,343,181\n |\n| 1986\n | 15.6%\n | 3,908,150\n | 25,022,005\n | 25,309,331\n |\n| 1991\n | 16.1%\n | 4,342,890\n | 26,994,045\n | 27,296,859\n |\n| 1996\n | 17.4%\n | 4,971,070\n | 28,528,125\n | 28,846,761\n |\n| 2001\n | 18.4%\n | 5,448,480\n | 29,639,030\n | 30,007,094\n |\n| 2006\n | 19.8%\n | 6,186,950\n | 31,241,030\n | 31,612,897\n |\n| 2011\n | 20.6%\n | 6,775,765\n | 32,852,325\n | 33,476,688\n |\n| 2016\n | 21.9%\n | 7,540,830\n | 34,460,060\n | 35,151,728\n |\n| 2021\n | 23%\n | 8,361,505\n | 36,328,475\n | 36,991,981\n |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Canada\n\nReligion in Canada\n\n\n\nChristianity (53.3%)\nNo Religion (34.6%)\nIslam (4.9%)\nHinduism (2.3%)\nSikhism (2.1%)\nBuddhism (1.0%)\nJudaism (0.9%)\nOthers (0.8%)\n\nIn 2021, 53.3% of Canadians were Christians,[99] down from 67.3% in 2011.[100] 29.9% were Catholic while 11.4% were Protestant (all other listed denominations excluding Christian Orthodox, Latter Day Saints and Jehovah's Witnesses). 7.6% were Christian not otherwise specified, 2.1% were \"other Christian and Christian-related traditions\", 1.7% were Christian Orthodox, 0.4% were Jehovah's Witnesses and 0.2% were Latter Day Saints adherents.\n\n\n34.6% of Canadians were non-religious or secular, up from 23.9% in 2011.

Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage.\"[45][46][49][50]\n4. **^** Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority in Statistics Canada calculations.

As of 2022[update], Chinese state media reported the country's total fertility rate to be 1.09.[4]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2 billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n\n\n### Population control[edit]\n\n\nSee also: One-child policy and Two-child policy\n\n![](image)Birth rate in China\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963–66 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.\n\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"barefoot doctors\" distributed information and contraceptives to people's commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2 billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted[*by whom?*] to be sterilized.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10 million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population.[22] On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China. For the rapid reduction of marriage and fertility, the central government should establish the policy to deal with the high house price.[23]\n\n\n\n### Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the year 2000\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949–2022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the *wǎn xī shǎo* (\"晚、稀、少\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966–76)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChina exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).[30]\n\n\nThe 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and\n1.44 in rural areas).[31]\nThe five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai\n(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest\nfertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui\n(1.48).[31]\n\n\nTotal fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).[32]\n\n\nIn 2022, the TFR was 1.09.[4]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.[33]\nThe World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71 million.[34]\n\n\n\n### Height and weight[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5 ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women's average height was 158 centimeters (5 ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4 lbs, or 11 stone 0 lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5 lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1 lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47  in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31 in) respectively from 5 years earlier.[35]\n\n\n\n### Gender balance[edit]\n\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8 million of China's population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16 million, 1.28%), Manchu (10 million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9 million, 0.78%), Hui (9 million, 0.71%), Miao (8 million, 0.71%), Yi (7 million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75 million, 0.63%), Mongols (5 million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5 million, 0.43%), Buyei (3 million, 0.23%), and Korean (2 million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China.[37] Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of China according to ethnic

Migration in China and Chinese emigration\n\nInternal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization.[67] In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\"[68] Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system.[69] In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.[70]\n\n\nIn 2011 a total of 252.78 million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).[71] Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people.[72] This population of migrants would represent \"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\" a number which is almost three times the current level.[72][73] While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\"[74] China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.[75]\n\n\nThe mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora,[76] which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called \"coolies\" by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban construction work in Guangshui, 2013\nMain article: Urbanization in China\n\nUrbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2014, 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[78]\nNo statistics have been included for areas currently governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It is worthwhile to note that this does not include other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of national ancestral gods or the gods of nature (which in northern China is more common than ancestor worship), and Taoism and Confucianism.\n2. **^** Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups.\n3. **^** The map represents the geographic diffusion of the tradition of folk religious movements of salvation, Confucian churches and *jiaohua* (\"transformative teachings\") movements, based on historical data and contemporary fieldwork. Due to incomplete data and ambiguous identity of many of these traditions the map may not be completely accurate. Sources include a *World Religion Map* from Harvard University, based on data from the World Religion Database, showing highly unprecise ranges of Chinese folk (salvationist) religions' membership by province. Another source, the studies of China's Regional Religious System, find \"very high activity of popular religion and secret societies and low Buddhist presence in northern regions, while very high Buddhist presence in the southeast\".[44]\n[note 2]\n\n\t* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois[45] testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their \"energetic revival since the 1970s\" (p. 13), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.\n\t* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)[46] Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p. 7) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (\"Order of Heaven\") sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).\n\t* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).[47] Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.\n\t* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One (皈依道 *Guīyīdào*), the Way of Unity (一貫道 *Yīguàndào*), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.[48]\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,[49] about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.\n4. **^** The statistics for Chinese ancestorism, that is the worship of ancestor-gods within the lineage system, are from the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2010.[43] The statistics for Buddhism and Christianity are from the China Family Panel Studies survey of 2012.[51] The statistics for Islam are from a survey conducted in 2010.[52] It is worthwhile to note that the populations of Chinese ancestorism and Buddhism may overlap, even with the large remaining parts of the population whose belief is not documented in the table. The latter, the uncharted population, may practise other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of gods, Taoism, Confucianism and folk salvationisms, or may be atheist. Indeed, according to the CFPS 2012, only 6.3% of the Chinese were irreligious in the sense of \"atheism\", while the rest practised the worship of gods and ancestors.[53]: 13\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.

In the cohort-component method, the components of population change (fertility, mortality, and net migration) are projected separately for each birth cohort (persons born in a given year). The base population is advanced each year by using projected survival rates and net international migration. Each year, a new birth cohort is added to the population by applying the projected fertility rates to the female population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** Tavernise, Sabrina (June 20, 2018). \"Fewer Births Than Deaths Among Whites in Majority of U.S. States\". *The New York Times*.\n126. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Patino, Marie (May 15, 2019). \"U.S. Births Fell to Lowest Level in 32 Years in 2018\". *Bloomberg News*.\n127. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"A Look at the 1940 Census\" (PDF). *United States Census Bureau*. pp. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.\n128. **^** \"Table A.

Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.[174]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39 million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 65 | 86,039 | 19.8 | 76,439 | 17.0\n | 81,181\n | 18.5\n |\n| 70 | 80,547 | 15.9 | 68,491 | 13.7\n | 74,466\n | 14.9\n |\n| 75 | 72,737 | 12.4 | 58,588 | 10.6\n | 65,565\n | 11.6\n |\n| 80 | 61,298 | 9.2 | 45,661 | 7.8\n | 53,346\n | 8.6\n |\n| 85 | 45,424 | 6.5 | 30,276 | 5.5\n | 37,700\n | 6.1\n |\n| 90 | 26,271 | 4.4 | 14,824 | 3.7\n | 20,477\n | 4.2\n |\n| 95 | 9,599 | 2.9 | 4,216 | 2.5\n | 6,889\n | 2.8\n |\n| 100 | 1,727 | 2.0 | 549 | 1.8\n | 1,142\n | 2.0\n |\n\n\n### Density[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of states and territories of the United States by population density and List of United States cities by population density\n\nThe most densely populated state is New Jersey (1,263/mi2 or 488/km2).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percentage of women childless by age cohort in the US over time\n* 27.1 years (2020 est.)[41]\n\n\n### Dependency ratio[edit]\n\n\nThe dependency ratio is the age-population ratio of people who are normally not in the labor force (the dependent population, which includes those aged 0 to 14 and 65 and older) to those who are (the productive part, ages 15 to 64).

Among non-Hispanic white women, no states had a fertility rate above the replacement level. Among non-Hispanic Black women, 12 states reached above the replacement level needed. Among Hispanic women, 29 states did.[123] For non-Hispanic white women, the highest total fertility rate was in Utah, at 2.099, and the lowest in the District of Columbia, at 1.012. Among non-Hispanic Black women, the highest total fertility rate was in Maine, at 4.003, and the lowest in Wyoming, at 1.146. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe U.S. total fertility rate as of 2020 is 1.641[41]\n\n\n\n* 1.55 for non-Hispanic whites[41]\n* 1.71 for non-Hispanic Blacks[41]\n* 1.65 for Native Americans (including Hispanics)\n* 1.53 for Asian Americans (including Hispanics)\n\n\nOther:[60]\n\n\n\n* 1.88 for *Hispanics* (of all racial groups)[41]\n\n\n(**Note** that ≈95% of Hispanics are included as \"white Hispanics\" by CDC, which does not recognize the Census's \"Some other race\" category and counts people in that category as white.)\n\n\nSource: National Vital statistics report based on 2010 US Census data[129]\n\n\n\n#### Total Fertility Rates from 1800 to 2010[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

In the same period, the rate of births to Asian and Hispanic women increased by 2% and 6%, respectively.[27][26]\n\n\n\nPew Research Center projections\n\nThe United Nations projects a population of just over 400 million in 2060.[174]\n\n\n\n\n\nPew Research Center projections (2008)[175]\n|  | 1960 | 2005 | 2050\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White Americans | 85% | 67% | 47%\n |\n| Hispanic Americans | 3.5% | 14% | 29%\n |\n| Black Americans | 11% | 13% | 14%\n |\n| Asian Americans | 0.6% | 5% | 9%\n |\n| Note: All races modified and not Hispanic; American Indian/Alaska Native not shown.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA total of 3,659,289 babies were born in 2021, a 1% increase from 2020. Additionally, researchers also looked at births by race and found that White and Hispanic women each saw the number of births increase by about 2% from 2020 to 2021. Meanwhile, Black and Asian women saw the number of births decline by 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, over the same period, while American Indian/Alaskan Native women saw their numbers fall by 3.2%.[54] It also marks the first rise in births since 2014. Prior to this report, the total number of births had been decreasing by an average of 2% per year.[54] However, the total fertility rate (the number of births a hypothetical group of 1,000 people would have over their lifetimes) was 1,663.5 births per 1,000 women. This is still below the replacement level, the level a population needs to replace itself, which is 2,100 births per 1,000 women.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** \"Largest region-of-birth group of immigrants in US\" (PDF). *U.S. Census Bureau*.

Census Bureau, in 2021, the population of the United States grew at a slower rate than in any other year since the country's founding.[77] The U.S. population grew only 0.1% from the previous year before.[77] The United States' population has grown by less than one million people for the first time since 1937, with the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began yearly population estimates.[77] Apart from the previous few years, when population growth plummeted to historically low levels, the slowest pace of increase in the twentieth century occurred between 1918 and 1919, when the influenza epidemic and World War I were both in full swing.[77] Slower population growth has been the norm in the United States for some years, owing to lower fertility and net international migration, as well as rising mortality from an aging population.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Age group (2010)\n | Total (of population)\n | White alone (of race/age group)\n |

Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \"Protestant\" or \"Christian\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.\n\n\n**Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008**[210]  \nFigures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \"no religion\" than any other group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n198. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Statistics\". *Baptist World Alliance*.

Only one ethnicity may be selected, however, because the Census Bureau recognizes only two ethnicities – Hispanic and Non-Hispanic – which are mutually exclusive since you can be one or the other, but not both.

The highest rate was in Acre, with 1.98 children per woman. Other regions with high fertility include Amapá, with 1.87 children per woman, Amazonas, 1.85 in Roraima, 1.84, in Maranhão, 1.82, and Pará, 1.79.\n\n\nOn the other hand, São Paulo is the state with the lowest rate, 1.26 children per woman. Other states with low fertility include Santa Catarina, with 1.28, Rio Grande do Sul, 1.3, in Rio de Janeiro, 1.32 in Paraná and Minas Gerais, 1.33.\n\n\nRegarding race of mothers, between 2015 and 2021, the fertility rate of all racial groups fell below replacement rate. Black fertility fell from 2.01 to 1.76, Pardo/Mixed fertility fell from 1.95 to 1.73 and white fertility fell from 1.90 to 1.55. There was no information regarding Asian fertility rates. Indigenous fertility was calculated at 1.87 children per women in 2010.[22]\n\n\n\n### Childlessness and education[edit]\n\n\nThe color or race of the woman and the level of education has also shown to influence the fact of not having children. In 2013, among white women aged 15 to 55 years, 41.5% had no children, while among black and brown women, the percentage was 35.8%.\n\n\nThe proportional difference is even greater among white women compared to black and brown 25–29 years. While the proportion among white women childless was 48.1% among black and brown women was 33.8%.\n\n\nRegarding education, among women 15–49 years of age with more than eight years of schooling, 44.2% had no children in 2013, while among those with up to seven years of study this figure was 21.6%.\n\n\nSchooling among women 25–29 years has shown an even greater disparity. Among the less educated, 16.3% had no children, while among the more educated 54.5% had no children.

Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of largest cities in Brazil and Largest Cities of Northeast Region, Brazil\nIn Brazil, most important cities are on the coast or close to it. State capitals are also, commonly, the largest city of their states. Notable exceptions to this are Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.\n\n\nThere are also non-capital metropolitan areas, for example, in São Paulo state (Campinas, Santos, Paraíba Valley, Sorocaba, Ribeirão Preto and Franca), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley), and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley), amongst others.\n\n\nSão Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian cities. São Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; Rio de Janeiro – partially due to its former status as the national capital – still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being Brazil's cultural center with respect to film production and other such televised media. Brasília, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|

etc. Brazil has received the third largest number of immigrants in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\nBrazil's structure, legislation and settlement policies for arriving immigrants were much less organized than in Canada and the United States at the time. Nevertheless, an Immigrant Inn (*Hospedaria dos Imigrantes*) was built in 1886 in São Paulo, and quick admittance and recording routines for the throngs of immigrants arriving by ship at the seaports of Vitória, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Paranaguá, Florianópolis and Porto Alegre were established. The São Paulo State alone processed more than 2.5 million immigrants in its almost 100 years of continuous operation. People of more than 70 different nationalities were recorded.\n\n\nFollowing the trend of several other countries in the Americas, which encouraged immigration from many countries, Brazil quickly became a melting pot of races and nationalities, but being peculiar in the sense of having the highest degree of intermarriage in the world. Immigrants found a strong social and cultural tolerance toward inter-racial marriage, including large numbers of Mulattoes (European and African), Caboclos (Indian and European) and mixed European, African and Indian people, though it was not accompanied by an entire lack of racism. Correspondingly, the same mentality reflected in low psychological and social barriers regarding intermarriage between Europeans, Middle Easterners and Asians of several origins, as well as between people of different religions.\n\n\n\n### History of immigration[edit]\n\n\nIt is postulated that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Native Brazilians are thought to descend from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups are the Tupi-Guarani, the Jê, the Arawaks and the Caraibas (Kalina or Caribs). The Tupi-Guarani nation, originally from the Paraná river basin and also one of the largest of the Native-Paraguayan nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and came to be known by the Portuguese as \"Os Índios da Língua Geral\" (\"The Indians of the General Language\"); the Jê nation occupied most of the interior of the country from Maranhão to Santa Catarina. The Arawaks and the Caribs, the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.\n\n\nThe European immigration to Brazil started in the 16th century, with the vast majority of them coming from Portugal. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the 18th century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year).[29] The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was Northeastern Brazil, followed by the Southeast region. The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between two and five million) largely died from disease or violence or was assimilated into the Portuguese population.[30] The Mamelucos (or Caboclos, a mixed race between Europeans and Amerindians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.\n\n\nAnother important ethnic group, Africans, first arrived as slaves. Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\nThese immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to Southern Brazil to work as small farmers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to Southeast Brazil to work in the coffee plantations. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly Germans (starting in 1824, mainly from Rhineland-Palatinate, Pomerania, Hamburg, Westphalia, etc.) Italians (starting in 1875, mainly from the Veneto and Lombardia), Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, Dutch and Russians. In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that retain a cultural connection with their ancestral homelands. In Southeast Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the Veneto, Campania, Calabria and Lombardia), Portuguese (mainly from Beira Alta, Minho and Alto Trás-os-Montes), Dutch, Spaniards (mainly from Galicia and Andalusia), Lithuanians, French, Hungarians and Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\nNotably, the first half of the 20th century saw a large inflow of Japanese (mainly from Honshū, Hokkaidō and Okinawa) and Levantine Christians from Lebanon (and few from Syria). These Christian Levantine immigrants were wrongly called \"Turks\" by many Brazilians because their original countries were still under Ottoman rule back in the period when their immigration to Brazil began. The number of actual Turks who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small. Chinese, Taiwanese and Koreans influx became common after the 1950s.\n\n\n\n### IBGE's 1998 PME[edit]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census). This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[34] To this day, it remains the only actual published survey about the immigrant origin of Brazilians.\n\n\nHere are its results:[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Population, by ancestry, 1998[33]\n| Ancestry | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Brazil](image) \"Brazilian\" | 86.09%\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portuguese | 10.46%\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italian | 10.41%\n |\n| Indigenous | 6.64%\n |\n| Black | 5.09%\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spanish | 4.40%\n |\n| ![Germany](image) German | 3.54%\n |\n| African | 2.06%\n |\n| ![Japan](image) Japanese | 1.34%\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)![Syria](image) Lebanese/Syrian | 0.48%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.20%\n |\n| Others | 2.81%\n |\n| Total | 133.52%\n |\n\n\nNotice that the total is higher than 100% because of multiple answers. Many Brazilians are unaware of their ancestry, especially those of old immigration, due to this the high number who declared themselves only as Brazilians.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Brazilians from various socioeconomic backgrounds started to emigrate to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, nearly 1.9 million Brazilians were living outside the country, mainly in the United States, Paraguay and Japan,[36] but also in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Israel. Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\nThe largest Brazilian community abroad - comprising almost half of the diaspora - is the one in the US, where around 2,000,000 Brazilians live; they are present especially in Florida. Almost 300,000 Brazilians - hence 6.8% of all Brazilians living abroad - lived in other Portuguese-speaking countries (94% in Portugal). In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has Italian ancestry\n![](image)Italian regional immigration to Brazil, which has the most people of Italian origin outside Italy. Unlike other countries with Italian immigrants, Brazil prioritized Northern Italy which it considered more developed\n![](image)German colonies in Southern BrazilThe bulk of the Brazilian population descends from three main source populations (either alone, or more commonly, in varying combinations mixed in varying degrees); early European settlers (chiefly ethnic Portuguese, but also Portuguese New Christians of ethnic Sephardic Jewish origin forced to convert to Christianity),[39] sub-Saharan Africans (Yoruba, Ewe, Akan, Bantu, and others), and the indigenous peoples in Brazil (mostly Tupi and Guarani, but also many other indigenous Brazilian ethnic groups).\n\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, Brazil received substantial post-colonial immigration from several other regions, mainly from peoples of what are now the countries of Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland, as well as Middle-Eastern Christians from the Levant (mostly from what is now Lebanon, and less so from Syria), Ukraine, Japan, China and Korea.\n\n\nJews in Brazil are a small but sizable population,[40][41] and they include mostly Ashkenazi Jews (who also arrived with the post-colonial contingent of European migration),[42] a smaller proportion of Sephardi Jews (mostly Eastern Sephardim arrived with the contingent of post-colonial immigrants from Syria and Lebanon, but also North African Sephardim from Morocco settled in the Amazon, and Western Sephardim arrived with the Dutch), and to a much lesser extent Mizrahi Jews.\n\n\nOverall, the small but sizable Brazilian Jewish community is concentrated especially in São Paulo,[43] Rio de Janeiro[44] and Porto Alegre,[45] and they are accounted for without Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" (ethnic Sephardic Jews forced to convert to Christianity and arrived with the ethnic Portuguese during the colonial period),[42] which if included would inflate the Jewish origin population in Brazil considerably. By themselves, Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" are estimated to account for a figure anywhere between hundreds of thousands to several million.\n\n\nThe descendants of European immigrants, particularly the Germans, Italians, Austrians, Swiss, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Lithuanians, Scandinavians, Russians, Hungarians, Finns and Luxembourgers are mainly concentrated in the southern part of the country, in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and the most populous, São Paulo; these states have a wide majority of citizens of European descent.[46][47]\nSão Paulo alone has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million Europeans.[48]\n\n\nIn the rest of the country, part of the European-Brazilian population is of colonial Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and French settler stock, especially in the Northeast. In the mid-southern states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul and in the Federal District, the number of Europeans (European and Levantine phenotype) revolves around 50% of the population or above, being close to the proportion of people of Mixed-race Brazilians, and other minorities like Black Brazilians and East Asian Brazilians.[49]\n\n\nIn the Northeast, which received large masses of African slaves to work in sugarcane, tobacco and cotton plantations, people of African and mixed-race descent predominate, mostly on the coast, whereas in the semi-arid country land (usually called *sertão*) there is a predominance of Europeans and Amerindian-European mixed people. Most of the African or mulatto people in the *sertão* are descended from freed African slaves or mulattos who fled inland from the coast and worked as cowboys for semi-feudal lords.\n\n\nThe city of Salvador da Bahia is considered one of the largest African cities of the world. In the Northwest (covering largely the Brazilian Amazon), a great part of the population has distinguishable ethnic characteristics that emphasize their Amerindian roots. Other ethnic groups have merged with the Indigenous tribes there. This region is not densely populated, and \"caboclos\", people of mixed native and European descent, are a small part of the entire Brazilian population.\n\n\nThe Japanese are the largest Asian group in Brazil. In fact, Brazil has the largest population of Japanese ancestry outside Japan, with 1.8 million Japanese Brazilians, most of them living in São Paulo. Some Chinese and Korean also settled Brazil. Most Chinese came from mainland China, but others came from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also from Portuguese-speaking Macau—these Chinese from Macau could speak and understand Portuguese, and it was not hard for them to adjust to Brazilian life.\n\n\nThose immigrant populations and their descendants still retain some of their original ethnic identity; however, they are not closed communities and are rapidly integrating into mainstream Brazilian society: for instance, very few of the third generation can understand their grandparents' languages.\n\n\n\n### European-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were more than 104 million European-Brazilians, comprising 48% of Brazil's population.[50] European-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely or mostly descended from European immigrants, although most Brazilians have some degree of European ancestry. Europeans are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although they are most concentrated in the south and southeastern parts of the country. \n[51][52]\n\n\nA survey conducted in 1998 by the Minas Gerais sociologist Simon Schwartzman interviewed about 34 million Brazilians, of whom nearly 20 million declared themselves white. Asked the ethnic origin of the participants of white race, a plurality pointed only Brazilian origin (53%).\n\n\nMore than half, however, managed to point to a foreign origin: 17.2% indicated Portuguese ancestry, 16.50% Italian, 9.42% Spanish, 6.51% German and 12.32% other origins, which include Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Austrian, Swiss, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, partial distant African, indigenous, British, American Confederate, Jewish (mostly Ashkenazi, but also Sephardi including Jews from Morocco and Egypt) and Christian Levantine (Lebanese).[53][54]\n\n\nNearly one million Europeans had arrived in Brazil by 1800; most of them colonists from Portugal. An immigration boom occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, when nearly six million Europeans emigrated to Brazil, most of them Portuguese, Germans, Italians and Spaniards.\n\n\nMany European-Brazilians have some Amerindian and/or African ancestry (similarly found in European-Americans[55] and European-Argentines).[56] It is estimated that 75% of all Brazilians have varying degrees of Portuguese ancestry.\n\n\nNowadays, European-Brazilians come from a very diverse background, which includes:\n\n\n\n* The Dutch were among the Europeans settling in Brazil during the 17th century. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch controlled the northeast coast of Brazil, establishing their colonial capital in Recife. During the 19th and 20th century, immigrants from the Netherlands populated the central and southern states of Brazil.[57][58] The first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their metropoles went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeelandic Flanders in the Dutch province of Zeeland.[59] Dutch and other Low Franconian languages are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially Holambra (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around Ponta Grossa, Castrolanda and Carambeí known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.[60][61]\n* The first Germans and Austrians arrived in Brazil in 1824. Most of them established themselves in rural communities across Southern Brazil, such as São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Blumenau and Pomerode. In Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil, Germans and Austrians represented over 45% of all immigrants arriving, and in the entire country, citizens who descend from German-speaking nationalities, including Swiss and Luxemburger, but also Volga German, may represent as much as 8% of the absolute population, since Brazil is home to the second largest German-Austrian population outside their respective nations, after the USA. And German is the second most spoken mother tongue in the country.[62][63][64] According to Ethnologue, Standard German is spoken by 1.5 million people and Brazilian German encompass assorted dialects, including Riograndenser Hunsrückisch spoken by over 3 million Brazilians.[60][65][66]\n* Italians started arriving in Brazil in 1875, making up the main group of immigrants in the late 19th century.[67] First they settled in rural communities across Southern Brazil. In the early 20th century, they mostly settled in the coffee plantations in the Southeast, later moving to São Paulo capital to work in factories or starting their own businesses in trade, services and industry like businessman and industrialist count Francesco Matarazzo. In São Paulo, which came to be labeled an \"Italian city\" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 60% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.[68] 11% of Brazilians or 20 million citizens are of Italian extraction, possibly the largest number outside of Italy itself, most of them descended from Northern Italians, reason why Talian, or the Venetian dialect, is the third most spoken mother tongue in the nation.[69][70]\n* Poles came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of Paraná, working as small farmers.\n* Portuguese Most Brazilians are fully or partly of Portuguese ancestry. Portuguese settlers began arriving in 1500. Immigration increased during the 18th century and reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lusitanian immigration never ceased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Portuguese people in diaspora settled in Brazil especially during the 1970s coming from former Portuguese colonies like Macau or Angola after its independence. The Portuguese were always the largest ethnic group of immigrants to Brazil. In the early years of Portuguese colonization it is estimated that between 1500 and 1800 some 600,000 Portuguese immigrated to Brazil, and then between 1800 and 1980 another 600,000, then from 1980 to the present, 600,000 more. Portuguese immigration to Brazil will always be a constant, hence, will always comprise the largest percentage of European immigrants. By 2030, there will be an estimated 1,000,000 Portuguese total immigrants in Brazil as of 1980, significantly dwarfing all of the other immigrant groups. An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo. An estimated 15 million Brazilians are of direct Spanish descent.[75]\n* Ukrainians came mostly in the late 19th century. Currently they number approximately 980,000, most of whom live in a compact settlement in south central Paraná.[76]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch Brazilian, German Brazilian, Italian Brazilian, Polish Brazilian, Portuguese Brazilian, Spanish Brazilian, and Ukrainian Brazilian\n\n### Mixed-race/Pardo-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pardo Brazilians\n\nThe Pardos can be a mixture of Europeans, Levantine, Crypto-Jews or Anusim, Africans, Amerindians, Roma and Asians. Brazil does not have a category for multiracial people, but a Pardo (brown) one, which may include caboclos, mulatos, cafuzos (local ethnonyms for people of noticeable mixed European and Amerindian, African and European, and Amerindian and African descent, i.e., mestizos, mulattoes and zambos, respectively), the multiracial result of their intermixing (despite most of European and African Brazilians possessing some degree of race-mixing, since brownness in Brazil is a matter of phenotype) and assimilated, westernized indigenous people.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Pardos make up 43.13% or 82.3 million people of Brazil's population. Multiracial Brazilians live in the entire territory of Brazil. Although, according to DNA resources, most Brazilians possess some degree of mixed-race ancestry, less than 45% of the country's population classified themselves as being part of this group due to phenotype.[79]\n\n\nThe caboclo or mestiço population, those whose ancestry is Native and European, revolves around 43 million people or 21% of the population. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the caboclo population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers.\n\n\nSimilar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as mulatto or European and African mix, span from 62% to 83% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The pardo category in Brazil also includes 800 thousand Roma people, most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Eurasians can also be classified as pardo. The majority of them consisting of Ainoko or Hafu, individuals of Japanese and European ancestry.\n\n\nResearch has suggested that Asians from the early Portuguese Eastern Empire, known as Luso-Asians first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as Lascars, or as servants, slaves and concubines accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.[80] This first presence of Asians was limited to Northeast Brazil, especially Bahia, but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to Pará and other parts of the Northeast.\n\n\n\n### African-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Brazilians\n\nAfrican-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely, or mostly, descended from former African slaves, or immigrants. According to the 2010 census, there are 14,517,961 Black Brazilians, about 7.6% of the population.[81]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians have at least some degree of African heritage, the racial makeup of black Brazilians themselves is very mixed and mostly of them have a significant degree of white admixture with a minor indigenous component, the range of white admixture for Afro-Brazilians is typically between 30% and 70%; \"pure\" black Brazilians with more than 80% of their genes coming from African ancestry are a subgroup minority.[79]\n\n\n\n### Asian-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2006 census, people of East Asian descent number 1,919,000, or 1.1% of Brazil's population. Estimates say that there are 2.5 to 3.0 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil, who are mostly concentrated in two states: São Paulo and Paraná, but smaller communities are found in the entire territory of the country. Brazil has the largest population of Japanese descent outside Japan.[82]\n\n\nThere are also smaller communities of Korean people and Chinese origin.[83] Some Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Portuguese-based creole language called Macanese (patuá or macaísta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Japanese immigration to Brazil started on 18 June 1908, when the Japanese ship Kasato-Maru arrived in the Port of Santos, south of São Paulo, carrying the first 781 people to take advantage of a bilateral agreement promoting immigration.\n\n\nHalf of them were from the southern part of the Okinawa Island, located about 640 km (400 miles) south of the rest of Japan, which had its own distinct language and culture dating back to before the island's annexation by Tokyo in 1879. The names on shop fronts are in Japanese and selling everything from Japanese food and kitchen utensils to traditional home decorations. Red painted archways, Japanese temples and a Japanese garden are present in this little Japanese corner of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Aboriginal-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a mitochondrial DNA study.[84]\n\n\nHowever, only 0.4% of the population consider themselves to be Natives. Brazilians tend to consider \"Native South American\" a cultural, not racial category. When the first Portuguese arrived in Brazil, in 1500, there were between 2.5 and 3.2 million Natives living in the country. In the mid-19th century they were only 100,000 and in the late 20th century close to 300,000.\n\n\n\n## Genetic studies[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native American components.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA studies[edit]\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 58%\n | 27%\n | 15%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.[86]\n\n\n\"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil[87]), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Region[86] | European\n | African\n | Native American\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Northern Brazil | 68.80%\n | 10.50%\n | 18.50%\n |\n| Northeast Brazil | 69.10%\n | 18.30%\n | 12.40%\n |\n| Southeast Brazil | 74.20%\n | 17.30%\n | 7.30%\n |\n| Southern Brazil | 79.50%\n | 10.30%\n | 9.40%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 23%\n | 16%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nPairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".[92]\n\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[93]\n\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[94] A study from 2013 found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[95] Another study focused on highly admixed populations yielded similar results.[96]\n\n\n\n## Races and ethnicities by region[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brazil socio-geographic division\n\n### South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Centro-Sul\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 87% of the population.[82] In colonial times, this region had a very small population.\n\n\nThe region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.[97] Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast in 1617.[98]\n\n\nTo stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal.\n\n\nThey established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[99] The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).\n\n\nWith the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Africans were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.[100]\n\n\nAfter independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.[101]\n\n\nTo attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (*New Hamburg*).[102]\n\n\nFrom São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.[103] By 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.[104]\n\n\nThey created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native *gaúchos*. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.\n\n\nA significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,[105] 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória.[106]\n\n\n\n### Southeast[edit]\n\n\nThe Southeastern region of Brazil is the most ethnically diverse part of the country. Europeans make up 55.16% of its population, those of mixed-race 35.69%, and African descent 7.91%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and a small Amerindian community (0.2%).\n\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532.[107] The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Africans, Natives, and Europeans. The Indigenous peoples of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese.\n\n\nThe race mixing between the indigenous females and their European masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.\n\n\nIn the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War.\n\n\nThe Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the wealth, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines.\n\n\nThey were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \"African city\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had as many slaves since the end of the Roman Empire.[108] In 1808 the Portuguese royal family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15,000 Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.\n\n\nAfter independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \"inundated\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[109]\n\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\nThis region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.\n\n\nThe ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese males and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of African slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of African and European ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest African city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and European mixture.[111]\n\n\n\n### North[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Amazônia Legal\n\nNorthern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.\n\n\nMany people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.\n\n\n\n### Central-West[edit]\n\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\nThe Federal Constitution of 1988 and the 1996 *General Law of Education in Brazil* (LDB) attributed to the Federal Government, states, Federal District and municipalities the responsibility of managing the Brazilian educational system, considering three educational public systems as a basis for collaboration between these federal systems.\n\n\nEach of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources. The new Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal taxes for education.[112]\n\n\nAs set out by the Brazilian Constitution, the main responsibility for basic education is attributed to the states and municipalities. Hence, a historical feature of Brazilian basic education is its extremely decentralized nature, which gives great organizational autonomy to sub-national governments (27 states and 5,546 municipalities) in organizing their educational systems.\n\n\nEarly childhood education, from 0–6 years, is under exclusive responsibility of the municipalities. Responsibility for compulsory primary education from 1st to 9th grades is shared between states and municipalities. Kindergarten and pre-school education are the responsibility of local levels of government, whereas secondary schools are under the responsibility of the states.\n\n\nMaintenance of the system, including salaries, the definition of teacher career structures and supervision of early childhood, primary, and secondary levels (which make up basic education) is decentralized, and these levels are responsible for defining their respective curriculum content.\n\n\nHigher education starts with undergraduate or sequential courses, which may offer different specialization choices such as academic or vocational paths. Depending on the choice, students may improve their educational background with *Stricto Sensu* or *Lato Sensu* postgraduate courses.\n\n\nHigher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course. Diplomas and certificates are proof of having passed through higher education.\n\n\nAccording to Brazilian Government, the most serious health problems are:[113]\n\n\n\n* Childhood mortality: about 2.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 3.77% in the northeast region.\n* Motherhood mortality: about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002.\n* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by cancer.\n* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 71.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (14.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 82.3 deaths in the southeast region.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions. Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\nThe largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil, due greatly to Brazil's large Japanese population.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil and Portuguese language\n\nPortuguese is the only official language of Brazil.[119] It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity.\n\n\nMany Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese,[120] there are incentives stimulating preservation and the teaching of native languages. According to SIL International, 133 Native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi.[121] In 2006, the City of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of Amazonas), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with Portuguese.\n\n\nOther languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the Brazilian German dialects, such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and the East Pomeranian dialect, and also the Talian, based on the Italian Venetian language. There are also bilingual speakers of Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in Southern Brazil, especially Paraná. In the city of São Paulo, Levantine, Japanese, Chinese and Korean can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as Liberdade. Yiddish and Hebrew are used by Jewish communities mainly in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Recife as well as the Vlax Romani dialect by Romani communities all across the nation.\n\n\n\n## *The World Factbook* demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from *The World Factbook*, unless otherwise indicated[122]\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun: Brazilian(s)\n* adjective: Brazilian\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n* 217,650,530\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Portuguese (official)\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n* European | mainly Portuguese 47.6%\n* Caboclo, Castizo 23.1%\n* Mulatto, Quadroon, Octoroon 21%\n* Black Brazilians 7.0%\n* Asian (mainly Japanese) 1.2%\n* Indigenous 0.4%\n* Romani 0.4%\n* Eurasian, Hafu 0.3%\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* Total population: 94.4%\n* Male: 92.4%\n* Female: 96.4% (2019 est.)\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\n* Roman Catholic 64.6%\n* Other Catholic 0.4%\n* Protestant 22.2%\n\t+ Adventist (including Seventh-day Adventist and Adventist Church of Promise) 6.5%\n\t+ Assembly of God 2.0%\n\t+ Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%\n\t+ Universal Church of the Kingdom of God 1.0%\n\t+ Other Protestant 11.5%\n\t+ Other Christian 0.7%\n* Spiritist 2.2%\n* Other 1.4%\n* None 8%\n* Unspecified 0.4%\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Brazil\n* 2022 Brazilian census\n* Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* List of largest cities in Brazil\n* Racial democracy\n* *Brazilian Journal of Population Studies*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

The first official census took place in 1872. From that year, every 8 years (with some exceptions) the population is counted. The Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica has postponed the next census until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\nBrazil is the seventh most populated country in the world.\n\n\n\n* **1550** – 15,000\n* **1600** – 100,000\n* **1660** – 184,000\n* **1700** – 300,000\n* **1766** – 1,500,000\n* **1800** – 3,250,000\n* **1820** – 4,717,000\n* **1850** – 7,256,000\n* **1872** – 9,930,478\n* **1890** – 14,333,915\n* **1900** – 17,438,434\n* **1920** – 30,635,605\n* **1940** – 41,236,315\n* **1950** – 51,944,397\n* **1960** – 70,119,071\n* **1970** – 93,139,037\n* **1980** – 119,070,865\n* **1991** – 146,917,459\n* **1996** – 157,079,573\n* **2000** – 169,544,443\n* **2010** – 192,755,799[11]\n* **2022** – 203,062,512[12]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Brazilian states by population\nPopulation distribution in Brazil is very uneven.

The highest rate was in Acre, with 1.98 children per woman. Other regions with high fertility include Amapá, with 1.87 children per woman, Amazonas, 1.85 in Roraima, 1.84, in Maranhão, 1.82, and Pará, 1.79.\n\n\nOn the other hand, São Paulo is the state with the lowest rate, 1.26 children per woman. Other states with low fertility include Santa Catarina, with 1.28, Rio Grande do Sul, 1.3, in Rio de Janeiro, 1.32 in Paraná and Minas Gerais, 1.33.\n\n\nRegarding race of mothers, between 2015 and 2021, the fertility rate of all racial groups fell below replacement rate. Black fertility fell from 2.01 to 1.76, Pardo/Mixed fertility fell from 1.95 to 1.73 and white fertility fell from 1.90 to 1.55. There was no information regarding Asian fertility rates. Indigenous fertility was calculated at 1.87 children per women in 2010.[22]\n\n\n\n### Childlessness and education[edit]\n\n\nThe color or race of the woman and the level of education has also shown to influence the fact of not having children. In 2013, among white women aged 15 to 55 years, 41.5% had no children, while among black and brown women, the percentage was 35.8%.\n\n\nThe proportional difference is even greater among white women compared to black and brown 25–29 years.

Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of largest cities in Brazil and Largest Cities of Northeast Region, Brazil\nIn Brazil, most important cities are on the coast or close to it. State capitals are also, commonly, the largest city of their states. Notable exceptions to this are Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina.\n\n\nThere are also non-capital metropolitan areas, for example, in São Paulo state (Campinas, Santos, Paraíba Valley, Sorocaba, Ribeirão Preto and Franca), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley), and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley), amongst others.\n\n\nSão Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian cities. São Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; Rio de Janeiro – partially due to its former status as the national capital – still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being Brazil's cultural center with respect to film production and other such televised media. Brasília, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|

etc. Brazil has received the third largest number of immigrants in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\nBrazil's structure, legislation and settlement policies for arriving immigrants were much less organized than in Canada and the United States at the time. Nevertheless, an Immigrant Inn (*Hospedaria dos Imigrantes*) was built in 1886 in São Paulo, and quick admittance and recording routines for the throngs of immigrants arriving by ship at the seaports of Vitória, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Paranaguá, Florianópolis and Porto Alegre were established. The São Paulo State alone processed more than 2.5 million immigrants in its almost 100 years of continuous operation. People of more than 70 different nationalities were recorded.\n\n\nFollowing the trend of several other countries in the Americas, which encouraged immigration from many countries, Brazil quickly became a melting pot of races and nationalities, but being peculiar in the sense of having the highest degree of intermarriage in the world. Immigrants found a strong social and cultural tolerance toward inter-racial marriage, including large numbers of Mulattoes (European and African), Caboclos (Indian and European) and mixed European, African and Indian people, though it was not accompanied by an entire lack of racism. Correspondingly, the same mentality reflected in low psychological and social barriers regarding intermarriage between Europeans, Middle Easterners and Asians of several origins, as well as between people of different religions.\n\n\n\n### History of immigration[edit]\n\n\nIt is postulated that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Native Brazilians are thought to descend from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups are the Tupi-Guarani, the Jê, the Arawaks and the Caraibas (Kalina or Caribs). The Tupi-Guarani nation, originally from the Paraná river basin and also one of the largest of the Native-Paraguayan nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and came to be known by the Portuguese as \"Os Índios da Língua Geral\" (\"The Indians of the General Language\"); the Jê nation occupied most of the interior of the country from Maranhão to Santa Catarina. The Arawaks and the Caribs, the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.\n\n\nThe European immigration to Brazil started in the 16th century, with the vast majority of them coming from Portugal. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the 18th century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year).[29] The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was Northeastern Brazil, followed by the Southeast region. The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between two and five million) largely died from disease or violence or was assimilated into the Portuguese population.[30] The Mamelucos (or Caboclos, a mixed race between Europeans and Amerindians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.\n\n\nAnother important ethnic group, Africans, first arrived as slaves. Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\nThese immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to Southern Brazil to work as small farmers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to Southeast Brazil to work in the coffee plantations. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly Germans (starting in 1824, mainly from Rhineland-Palatinate, Pomerania, Hamburg, Westphalia, etc.) Italians (starting in 1875, mainly from the Veneto and Lombardia), Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, Dutch and Russians. In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that retain a cultural connection with their ancestral homelands. In Southeast Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the Veneto, Campania, Calabria and Lombardia), Portuguese (mainly from Beira Alta, Minho and Alto Trás-os-Montes), Dutch, Spaniards (mainly from Galicia and Andalusia), Lithuanians, French, Hungarians and Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\nNotably, the first half of the 20th century saw a large inflow of Japanese (mainly from Honshū, Hokkaidō and Okinawa) and Levantine Christians from Lebanon (and few from Syria). These Christian Levantine immigrants were wrongly called \"Turks\" by many Brazilians because their original countries were still under Ottoman rule back in the period when their immigration to Brazil began. The number of actual Turks who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small. Chinese, Taiwanese and Koreans influx became common after the 1950s.\n\n\n\n### IBGE's 1998 PME[edit]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census). This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[34] To this day, it remains the only actual published survey about the immigrant origin of Brazilians.\n\n\nHere are its results:[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Population, by ancestry, 1998[33]\n| Ancestry | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Brazil](image) \"Brazilian\" | 86.09%\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portuguese | 10.46%\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italian | 10.41%\n |\n| Indigenous | 6.64%\n |\n| Black | 5.09%\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spanish | 4.40%\n |\n| ![Germany](image) German | 3.54%\n |\n| African | 2.06%\n |\n| ![Japan](image) Japanese | 1.34%\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)![Syria](image) Lebanese/Syrian | 0.48%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.20%\n |\n| Others | 2.81%\n |\n| Total | 133.52%\n |\n\n\nNotice that the total is higher than 100% because of multiple answers. Many Brazilians are unaware of their ancestry, especially those of old immigration, due to this the high number who declared themselves only as Brazilians.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Brazilians from various socioeconomic backgrounds started to emigrate to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, nearly 1.9 million Brazilians were living outside the country, mainly in the United States, Paraguay and Japan,[36] but also in Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Israel. Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\nThe largest Brazilian community abroad - comprising almost half of the diaspora - is the one in the US, where around 2,000,000 Brazilians live; they are present especially in Florida. Almost 300,000 Brazilians - hence 6.8% of all Brazilians living abroad - lived in other Portuguese-speaking countries (94% in Portugal). In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has Italian ancestry\n![](image)Italian regional immigration to Brazil, which has the most people of Italian origin outside Italy. Unlike other countries with Italian immigrants, Brazil prioritized Northern Italy which it considered more developed\n![](image)German colonies in Southern BrazilThe bulk of the Brazilian population descends from three main source populations (either alone, or more commonly, in varying combinations mixed in varying degrees); early European settlers (chiefly ethnic Portuguese, but also Portuguese New Christians of ethnic Sephardic Jewish origin forced to convert to Christianity),[39] sub-Saharan Africans (Yoruba, Ewe, Akan, Bantu, and others), and the indigenous peoples in Brazil (mostly Tupi and Guarani, but also many other indigenous Brazilian ethnic groups).\n\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, Brazil received substantial post-colonial immigration from several other regions, mainly from peoples of what are now the countries of Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland, as well as Middle-Eastern Christians from the Levant (mostly from what is now Lebanon, and less so from Syria), Ukraine, Japan, China and Korea.\n\n\nJews in Brazil are a small but sizable population,[40][41] and they include mostly Ashkenazi Jews (who also arrived with the post-colonial contingent of European migration),[42] a smaller proportion of Sephardi Jews (mostly Eastern Sephardim arrived with the contingent of post-colonial immigrants from Syria and Lebanon, but also North African Sephardim from Morocco settled in the Amazon, and Western Sephardim arrived with the Dutch), and to a much lesser extent Mizrahi Jews.\n\n\nOverall, the small but sizable Brazilian Jewish community is concentrated especially in São Paulo,[43] Rio de Janeiro[44] and Porto Alegre,[45] and they are accounted for without Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" (ethnic Sephardic Jews forced to convert to Christianity and arrived with the ethnic Portuguese during the colonial period),[42] which if included would inflate the Jewish origin population in Brazil considerably. By themselves, Brazilian descendants of Portuguese \"New Christians\" are estimated to account for a figure anywhere between hundreds of thousands to several million.\n\n\nThe descendants of European immigrants, particularly the Germans, Italians, Austrians, Swiss, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Lithuanians, Scandinavians, Russians, Hungarians, Finns and Luxembourgers are mainly concentrated in the southern part of the country, in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and the most populous, São Paulo; these states have a wide majority of citizens of European descent.[46][47]\nSão Paulo alone has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million Europeans.[48]\n\n\nIn the rest of the country, part of the European-Brazilian population is of colonial Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and French settler stock, especially in the Northeast. In the mid-southern states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul and in the Federal District, the number of Europeans (European and Levantine phenotype) revolves around 50% of the population or above, being close to the proportion of people of Mixed-race Brazilians, and other minorities like Black Brazilians and East Asian Brazilians.[49]\n\n\nIn the Northeast, which received large masses of African slaves to work in sugarcane, tobacco and cotton plantations, people of African and mixed-race descent predominate, mostly on the coast, whereas in the semi-arid country land (usually called *sertão*) there is a predominance of Europeans and Amerindian-European mixed people. Most of the African or mulatto people in the *sertão* are descended from freed African slaves or mulattos who fled inland from the coast and worked as cowboys for semi-feudal lords.\n\n\nThe city of Salvador da Bahia is considered one of the largest African cities of the world. In the Northwest (covering largely the Brazilian Amazon), a great part of the population has distinguishable ethnic characteristics that emphasize their Amerindian roots. Other ethnic groups have merged with the Indigenous tribes there. This region is not densely populated, and \"caboclos\", people of mixed native and European descent, are a small part of the entire Brazilian population.\n\n\nThe Japanese are the largest Asian group in Brazil. In fact, Brazil has the largest population of Japanese ancestry outside Japan, with 1.8 million Japanese Brazilians, most of them living in São Paulo. Some Chinese and Korean also settled Brazil. Most Chinese came from mainland China, but others came from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also from Portuguese-speaking Macau—these Chinese from Macau could speak and understand Portuguese, and it was not hard for them to adjust to Brazilian life.\n\n\nThose immigrant populations and their descendants still retain some of their original ethnic identity; however, they are not closed communities and are rapidly integrating into mainstream Brazilian society: for instance, very few of the third generation can understand their grandparents' languages.\n\n\n\n### European-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were more than 104 million European-Brazilians, comprising 48% of Brazil's population.[50] European-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely or mostly descended from European immigrants, although most Brazilians have some degree of European ancestry. Europeans are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although they are most concentrated in the south and southeastern parts of the country. \n[51][52]\n\n\nA survey conducted in 1998 by the Minas Gerais sociologist Simon Schwartzman interviewed about 34 million Brazilians, of whom nearly 20 million declared themselves white. Asked the ethnic origin of the participants of white race, a plurality pointed only Brazilian origin (53%).\n\n\nMore than half, however, managed to point to a foreign origin: 17.2% indicated Portuguese ancestry, 16.50% Italian, 9.42% Spanish, 6.51% German and 12.32% other origins, which include Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Austrian, Swiss, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, partial distant African, indigenous, British, American Confederate, Jewish (mostly Ashkenazi, but also Sephardi including Jews from Morocco and Egypt) and Christian Levantine (Lebanese).[53][54]\n\n\nNearly one million Europeans had arrived in Brazil by 1800; most of them colonists from Portugal. An immigration boom occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, when nearly six million Europeans emigrated to Brazil, most of them Portuguese, Germans, Italians and Spaniards.\n\n\nMany European-Brazilians have some Amerindian and/or African ancestry (similarly found in European-Americans[55] and European-Argentines).[56] It is estimated that 75% of all Brazilians have varying degrees of Portuguese ancestry.\n\n\nNowadays, European-Brazilians come from a very diverse background, which includes:\n\n\n\n* The Dutch were among the Europeans settling in Brazil during the 17th century. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch controlled the northeast coast of Brazil, establishing their colonial capital in Recife. During the 19th and 20th century, immigrants from the Netherlands populated the central and southern states of Brazil.[57][58] The first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their metropoles went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeelandic Flanders in the Dutch province of Zeeland.[59] Dutch and other Low Franconian languages are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially Holambra (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around Ponta Grossa, Castrolanda and Carambeí known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.[60][61]\n* The first Germans and Austrians arrived in Brazil in 1824. Most of them established themselves in rural communities across Southern Brazil, such as São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Blumenau and Pomerode. In Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil, Germans and Austrians represented over 45% of all immigrants arriving, and in the entire country, citizens who descend from German-speaking nationalities, including Swiss and Luxemburger, but also Volga German, may represent as much as 8% of the absolute population, since Brazil is home to the second largest German-Austrian population outside their respective nations, after the USA. And German is the second most spoken mother tongue in the country.[62][63][64] According to Ethnologue, Standard German is spoken by 1.5 million people and Brazilian German encompass assorted dialects, including Riograndenser Hunsrückisch spoken by over 3 million Brazilians.[60][65][66]\n* Italians started arriving in Brazil in 1875, making up the main group of immigrants in the late 19th century.[67] First they settled in rural communities across Southern Brazil. In the early 20th century, they mostly settled in the coffee plantations in the Southeast, later moving to São Paulo capital to work in factories or starting their own businesses in trade, services and industry like businessman and industrialist count Francesco Matarazzo. In São Paulo, which came to be labeled an \"Italian city\" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 60% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.[68] 11% of Brazilians or 20 million citizens are of Italian extraction, possibly the largest number outside of Italy itself, most of them descended from Northern Italians, reason why Talian, or the Venetian dialect, is the third most spoken mother tongue in the nation.[69][70]\n* Poles came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of Paraná, working as small farmers.\n* Portuguese Most Brazilians are fully or partly of Portuguese ancestry. Portuguese settlers began arriving in 1500. Immigration increased during the 18th century and reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lusitanian immigration never ceased throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Portuguese people in diaspora settled in Brazil especially during the 1970s coming from former Portuguese colonies like Macau or Angola after its independence. The Portuguese were always the largest ethnic group of immigrants to Brazil. In the early years of Portuguese colonization it is estimated that between 1500 and 1800 some 600,000 Portuguese immigrated to Brazil, and then between 1800 and 1980 another 600,000, then from 1980 to the present, 600,000 more. Portuguese immigration to Brazil will always be a constant, hence, will always comprise the largest percentage of European immigrants. By 2030, there will be an estimated 1,000,000 Portuguese total immigrants in Brazil as of 1980, significantly dwarfing all of the other immigrant groups. An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo. An estimated 15 million Brazilians are of direct Spanish descent.[75]\n* Ukrainians came mostly in the late 19th century. Currently they number approximately 980,000, most of whom live in a compact settlement in south central Paraná.[76]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch Brazilian, German Brazilian, Italian Brazilian, Polish Brazilian, Portuguese Brazilian, Spanish Brazilian, and Ukrainian Brazilian\n\n### Mixed-race/Pardo-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pardo Brazilians\n\nThe Pardos can be a mixture of Europeans, Levantine, Crypto-Jews or Anusim, Africans, Amerindians, Roma and Asians. Brazil does not have a category for multiracial people, but a Pardo (brown) one, which may include caboclos, mulatos, cafuzos (local ethnonyms for people of noticeable mixed European and Amerindian, African and European, and Amerindian and African descent, i.e., mestizos, mulattoes and zambos, respectively), the multiracial result of their intermixing (despite most of European and African Brazilians possessing some degree of race-mixing, since brownness in Brazil is a matter of phenotype) and assimilated, westernized indigenous people.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Pardos make up 43.13% or 82.3 million people of Brazil's population. Multiracial Brazilians live in the entire territory of Brazil. Although, according to DNA resources, most Brazilians possess some degree of mixed-race ancestry, less than 45% of the country's population classified themselves as being part of this group due to phenotype.[79]\n\n\nThe caboclo or mestiço population, those whose ancestry is Native and European, revolves around 43 million people or 21% of the population. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the caboclo population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers.\n\n\nSimilar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as mulatto or European and African mix, span from 62% to 83% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The pardo category in Brazil also includes 800 thousand Roma people, most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Eurasians can also be classified as pardo. The majority of them consisting of Ainoko or Hafu, individuals of Japanese and European ancestry.\n\n\nResearch has suggested that Asians from the early Portuguese Eastern Empire, known as Luso-Asians first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as Lascars, or as servants, slaves and concubines accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.[80] This first presence of Asians was limited to Northeast Brazil, especially Bahia, but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to Pará and other parts of the Northeast.\n\n\n\n### African-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Brazilians\n\nAfrican-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely, or mostly, descended from former African slaves, or immigrants. According to the 2010 census, there are 14,517,961 Black Brazilians, about 7.6% of the population.[81]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians have at least some degree of African heritage, the racial makeup of black Brazilians themselves is very mixed and mostly of them have a significant degree of white admixture with a minor indigenous component, the range of white admixture for Afro-Brazilians is typically between 30% and 70%; \"pure\" black Brazilians with more than 80% of their genes coming from African ancestry are a subgroup minority.[79]\n\n\n\n### Asian-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asian Brazilians\n\nAccording to the 2006 census, people of East Asian descent number 1,919,000, or 1.1% of Brazil's population. Estimates say that there are 2.5 to 3.0 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil, who are mostly concentrated in two states: São Paulo and Paraná, but smaller communities are found in the entire territory of the country. Brazil has the largest population of Japanese descent outside Japan.[82]\n\n\nThere are also smaller communities of Korean people and Chinese origin.[83] Some Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Portuguese-based creole language called Macanese (patuá or macaísta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Japanese immigration to Brazil started on 18 June 1908, when the Japanese ship Kasato-Maru arrived in the Port of Santos, south of São Paulo, carrying the first 781 people to take advantage of a bilateral agreement promoting immigration.\n\n\nHalf of them were from the southern part of the Okinawa Island, located about 640 km (400 miles) south of the rest of Japan, which had its own distinct language and culture dating back to before the island's annexation by Tokyo in 1879. The names on shop fronts are in Japanese and selling everything from Japanese food and kitchen utensils to traditional home decorations. Red painted archways, Japanese temples and a Japanese garden are present in this little Japanese corner of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Aboriginal-Brazilians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. Over 60 million Brazilians possess at least one Native South American ancestor, according to a mitochondrial DNA study.[84]\n\n\nHowever, only 0.4% of the population consider themselves to be Natives. Brazilians tend to consider \"Native South American\" a cultural, not racial category. When the first Portuguese arrived in Brazil, in 1500, there were between 2.5 and 3.2 million Natives living in the country. In the mid-19th century they were only 100,000 and in the late 20th century close to 300,000.\n\n\n\n## Genetic studies[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native American components.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA studies[edit]\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 58%\n | 27%\n | 15%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study (2011), with nearly 1000 samples from every major race group (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\", according to their respective proportions) all over the country found out a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.[86]\n\n\n\"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil[87]), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Region[86] | European\n | African\n | Native American\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Northern Brazil | 68.80%\n | 10.50%\n | 18.50%\n |\n| Northeast Brazil | 69.10%\n | 18.30%\n | 12.40%\n |\n| Southeast Brazil | 74.20%\n | 17.30%\n | 7.30%\n |\n| Southern Brazil | 79.50%\n | 10.30%\n | 9.40%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).[85]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[85] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 16%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 23%\n | 16%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 64%\n | 24%\n | 12%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 67%\n | 23%\n | 10%\n |\n| South Region | 77%\n | 12%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nPairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".[92]\n\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[93]\n\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[94] A study from 2013 found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[95] Another study focused on highly admixed populations yielded similar results.[96]\n\n\n\n## Races and ethnicities by region[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brazil socio-geographic division\n\n### South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Centro-Sul\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 87% of the population.[82] In colonial times, this region had a very small population.\n\n\nThe region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.[97] Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast in 1617.[98]\n\n\nTo stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal.\n\n\nThey established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[99] The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).\n\n\nWith the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Africans were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.[100]\n\n\nAfter independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.[101]\n\n\nTo attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (*New Hamburg*).[102]\n\n\nFrom São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.\nIn the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.[103] By 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.\n\n\nAnother immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.[104]\n\n\nThey created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native *gaúchos*. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.\n\n\nA significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,[105] 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória.[106]\n\n\n\n### Southeast[edit]\n\n\nThe Southeastern region of Brazil is the most ethnically diverse part of the country. Europeans make up 55.16% of its population, those of mixed-race 35.69%, and African descent 7.91%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and a small Amerindian community (0.2%).\n\n\nSoutheast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532.[107] The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Africans, Natives, and Europeans. The Indigenous peoples of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese.\n\n\nThe race mixing between the indigenous females and their European masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.\n\n\nIn the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War.\n\n\nThe Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the wealth, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines.\n\n\nThey were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \"African city\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had as many slaves since the end of the Roman Empire.[108] In 1808 the Portuguese royal family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15,000 Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.\n\n\nAfter independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \"inundated\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[109]\n\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\nThis region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.\n\n\nThe ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese males and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of African slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of African and European ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest African city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and European mixture.[111]\n\n\n\n### North[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Amazônia Legal\n\nNorthern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.\n\n\nMany people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.\n\n\n\n### Central-West[edit]\n\n\nThe Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\nThe Federal Constitution of 1988 and the 1996 *General Law of Education in Brazil* (LDB) attributed to the Federal Government, states, Federal District and municipalities the responsibility of managing the Brazilian educational system, considering three educational public systems as a basis for collaboration between these federal systems.\n\n\nEach of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources. The new Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal taxes for education.[112]\n\n\nAs set out by the Brazilian Constitution, the main responsibility for basic education is attributed to the states and municipalities. Hence, a historical feature of Brazilian basic education is its extremely decentralized nature, which gives great organizational autonomy to sub-national governments (27 states and 5,546 municipalities) in organizing their educational systems.\n\n\nEarly childhood education, from 0–6 years, is under exclusive responsibility of the municipalities. Responsibility for compulsory primary education from 1st to 9th grades is shared between states and municipalities. Kindergarten and pre-school education are the responsibility of local levels of government, whereas secondary schools are under the responsibility of the states.\n\n\nMaintenance of the system, including salaries, the definition of teacher career structures and supervision of early childhood, primary, and secondary levels (which make up basic education) is decentralized, and these levels are responsible for defining their respective curriculum content.\n\n\nHigher education starts with undergraduate or sequential courses, which may offer different specialization choices such as academic or vocational paths. Depending on the choice, students may improve their educational background with *Stricto Sensu* or *Lato Sensu* postgraduate courses.\n\n\nHigher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course. Diplomas and certificates are proof of having passed through higher education.\n\n\nAccording to Brazilian Government, the most serious health problems are:[113]\n\n\n\n* Childhood mortality: about 2.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 3.77% in the northeast region.\n* Motherhood mortality: about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002.\n* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by cancer.\n* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 71.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (14.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 82.3 deaths in the southeast region.\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions. Some of these religions are Jehovah's Witnesses (1,100,000), Latter-day Saints (200,000), Buddhism (215,000), Judaism (86,000), and Islam (27,000).[115]\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.[116]\n\n\nFollowers of Protestantism are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were adherents of \"traditional churches\", mostly Lutherans, Presbyterians and Baptists. There are 120,000 Episcopalians in 9 dioceses (Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Since then, numbers of Pentecostal and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.\n\n\nIslam in Brazil was first practiced by African slaves.[117] The Muslim population in Brazil is made up mostly of Arab immigrants.[118]\n\n\nThe largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil, due greatly to Brazil's large Japanese population.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil and Portuguese language\n\nPortuguese is the only official language of Brazil.[119] It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity.\n\n\nMany Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese,[120] there are incentives stimulating preservation and the teaching of native languages. According to SIL International, 133 Native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi.[121] In 2006, the City of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of Amazonas), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with Portuguese.\n\n\nOther languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the Brazilian German dialects, such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and the East Pomeranian dialect, and also the Talian, based on the Italian Venetian language. There are also bilingual speakers of Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in Southern Brazil, especially Paraná. In the city of São Paulo, Levantine, Japanese, Chinese and Korean can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as Liberdade. Yiddish and Hebrew are used by Jewish communities mainly in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Recife as well as the Vlax Romani dialect by Romani communities all across the nation.\n\n\n\n## *The World Factbook* demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from *The World Factbook*, unless otherwise indicated[122]\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun: Brazilian(s)\n* adjective: Brazilian\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n* 217,650,530\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Portuguese (official)\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n* European | mainly Portuguese 47.6%\n* Caboclo, Castizo 23.1%\n* Mulatto, Quadroon, Octoroon 21%\n* Black Brazilians 7.0%\n* Asian (mainly Japanese) 1.2%\n* Indigenous 0.4%\n* Romani 0.4%\n* Eurasian, Hafu 0.3%\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* Total population: 94.4%\n* Male: 92.4%\n* Female: 96.4% (2019 est.)\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\n* Roman Catholic 64.6%\n* Other Catholic 0.4%\n* Protestant 22.2%\n\t+ Adventist (including Seventh-day Adventist and Adventist Church of Promise) 6.5%\n\t+ Assembly of God 2.0%\n\t+ Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%\n\t+ Universal Church of the Kingdom of God 1.0%\n\t+ Other Protestant 11.5%\n\t+ Other Christian 0.7%\n* Spiritist 2.2%\n* Other 1.4%\n* None 8%\n* Unspecified 0.4%\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Brazil\n* 2022 Brazilian census\n* Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* List of largest cities in Brazil\n* Racial democracy\n* *Brazilian Journal of Population Studies*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

It has a decentralized operational and management system, and social participation is present in all administrative levels.[1] The Brazilian health system is a complex composition of public sector (SUS), private health institutions and private insurances . Since the creation of SUS, Brazil has significantly improved in many health indicators, but a lot needs to be done in order to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC).\n\n\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative[2] finds that Brazil is doing 93.3% of what should be possible at its level of income for the right to health.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Social and Health Indicators [4] |\n| --- |\n| Life expectancy (2019)[5] | 76.6\n |\n| Infant mortality(2019) [6] | 1.24%\n |\n| Fertility rate (2019) [7] | 1.71\n |\n| Basic Sanitation(2019)[8] | 88%\n |\n| Smoking rates (2018) [9] | 9.3%\n |\n| Obesity female (2019)[10] | 30.2%\n |\n| Obesity male (2019)[10] | 22.8%\n |\n| Undernutrition (2018)[11] | 2.5%\n |\n| HIV prevalence (2017)[12] | 0.6%\n |\n\n\n\n## Health situation in Brazil[13][edit]\n\n\n\n\nHealth indicators and relative change over time in Brazil\n| Health Indicators | 1990 | 2019 (or latest data available) | Relative Change\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Life expectancy at birth[5] | 66.3\n | 76.6\n | 16%\n |\n| Child mortality rate (newborns who die before reaching 5 years)[12] | 6.29%\n | 1.39%\n | -78%\n |\n| Maternal Mortality Ratio (pregnancy related deaths per 100,000 live births/year)[12] | 104\n | 44 (2015)\n | -58%\n |\n| Death rates from suicide (suicide deaths per 100,000 individuals/year)[12] | 7.16\n | 6.09 (2017)\n | -15%\n |\n| Death rates from cancer (deaths from all cancers per 100,000 individuals/year)[12] | 121.63\n | 109.58 (2017)\n | -10%\n |\n| Share of premature deaths attributed to tobacco smoking[12] | 15.92 %\n | 12.43% (2017)\n | -22%\n |\n| Share of deaths caused by interpersonal violence [14] | 4.45%\n | 4.67%\n | 5%\n |\n| Share of adults who are obese[12] | 10.20%\n | 22.10% (2016)\n | 117%\n |\n| Number of new HIV cases [12] | 25.954\n | 83.333 (2017)\n | 221%\n |\n| Death rates from malaria ( per 100,000 individuals/year)[12] | 0.43\n | 0.03 (2017)\n | -94%\n |\n\n\n\n\nTotal disease burden by cause and relative change over time in Brazil\n| Total disease burden by cause (in million DALYs lost/year) | 1990 | 2017 | Relative Change\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Injuries\n | 7.83\n | 9.06\n | 16%\n |\n| Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases\n | 20.45\n | 8.4\n | -58%\n |\n| Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)\n | 29.11\n | 40.03\n | 37%\n |\n| Source: Our World in Data,[12] cited 2021 Sep 15.\n |\n\n\n* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 16.6% as of 2016.[4] Of this 65.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants is caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 26.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants is caused by cancer.\n* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 55.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (10.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 62.3 deaths in the southeast region.\n\n\nBrazil has reduced the malaria incidence by over 56%in the past decade compared to the year 2000, but yet it is the country in the region of the americas with the highest number of cases.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDengue is found in all the states of the country, with 4 viral stereotypes. Reported cases: 1.649.008 (2014).\n\n\nIn 2014 occurred the introduction of the Chikungunya fever virus in the country, and in 2015 the Zika virus, which are transmitted by Aedes aegypti. The vector is being faced with the strategy of Integrated Management vector and community awareness approach.[15]\n\n\nIn September, 30th 2020 the country has recorded more than 142.000 deaths linked to COVID-19 and more than 4.745.464 confirmed cases. It is one of the worst affected country just behind The US and India.[16]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Development of life expectancy\nThe life expectancy of the Brazilian population increased from 71.16 years in 1998 to 76.76 years in 2018, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE),[17] and currently 76.76 years in 2018.[4] The data indicate a significant progress compared with 59.50 years in 1940.\n\n\nDemographic projections foresee the continuation of this process, estimating a life expectancy in Brazil around 77.39 years in 2020.[18] According to the IBGE, Brazil will need some time to catch up with Japan, Hong Kong (China), Switzerland, Iceland, Australia, France and Italy, where the average life expectancy is already over 82. Although, research has shown that Brazil could achieve an expectancy of around 80.12 years by 2030 and pass 82 by 2040 and 2050 will be over 85 years.[18]\n\n\nThe decline in mortality at young ages and the increase in longevity, combined with the decline of fecundity and the accentuated increase of degenerative chronic diseases, caused a rapid process of demographic and epidemiological transition, imposing a new public health agenda in the face of the complexity of the new morbidity pattern.[19]\n\n\n\n## Infant mortality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cândido Fontoura Children's Hospital, São Paulo.\nFor example, mortality among indigenous infants in 2000 was more than triple that of the general population, highlighting the importance of tailored health policies to address disparities in health outcomes for Brazil's Indigenous Peoples.[20] Sanitation, education and per capita income are the most important explanatory factors of poor child health in Brazil.[21] Moreover, ethnographic findings of infant mortality rates (IMR) in northeast Brazil are not accurate because the government tends to overlook infant morality rates in rural areas.[22] These issues tend to be inaccurate due to a huge amount of underreporting and questions related to the cultural validity and the contextual soundness of these mortality statistics. There is a solution to this issue however and scientists stress that quality local-level cultural data can serve to craft as the alternative and appropriate method to measure infant death in Brazil accurately. In order to not overlook infant mortality rates it is also stressed that there needs to be a focus on an ethnography of experience, a vision that cuts to the core of human suffering as it flows from daily life and experiences. For example, one must get down to the flesh, blood and souls of infant death in the impoverished households of Brazilians in order to understand and live with those who have to suffer its consequences. Methods of gathering mortality data also need to be respectful of local death customs and must be implemented in places where death is experienced through a different cultural lens.[23]\n\n\nUNICEF report shows a rising rate of survival for Brazilian children under the age of five. UNICEF says that out of a total of 195 countries analyzed, Brazil is among the 25 nations with the best improvement in survival rates for children under the age of 5. The report shows that Brazil's infant mortality rate for live births in 2012 was 14 per thousand. Mortality rates for children at one year of age was 18 per thousand, a reduction of 60%. The study went on to show that malnutrition among children of less than two years of age during the period between 2000 and 2008 fell by 77%. There was also a substantial drop in the number of school age children who were not in school, falling from 920,000 to 570,000 during the same period. Cristina Albuquerque, coordinator of the UNICEF Infant Survival and Development Program called the numbers \"an enormous victory\" for Brazil. She added that with regard to public policy aimed at reducing social disparities, Brazil's Bolsa Família program had become an international benchmark in combating poverty, reducing vulnerability and improving quality of life. \"Brazil is going through a great moment, but much remains to be done. So, along with the celebrating it is a good time to reflect on the many challenges still to be overcome,\" Albuquerque declared.[24]\n\n\n\n## Obesity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portuguese Beneficent Hospital, in Manaus.\nObesity in Brazil is a growing health concern. 52.6 percent of men and 44.7 percent of women in Brazil are overweight. 35% of Brazilians are obese in 2018.[25][26] The Brazilian government has issued nutrition guidelines in 2014 [27] which have caught the attention of public health experts for their simplicity and their critical position towards the food industry.[28] In September 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture publicised a technical note saying that the Guideine \" Attacks without justification \" industrialized food and asked for revision of the recommendation. International scientists send a group letter to the ministry of Agriculture criticizing the position in relation to The Brazilian food guide..The guidelines are summarized at the end of the document as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Prepare meals using fresh and staple foods.\n2. Use oils, fats, sugar, and salt only in moderation.\n3. Limit consumption of ready-to-eat food and drink products.\n4. Eat at regular mealtimes and pay attention to your food instead of multitasking. Find a comfortable place to eat. Avoid all-you-can-eat buffets and noisy, stressful environments.\n5. Eat with others whenever possible.\n6. Buy food in shops and markets that offer a variety of fresh foods. Avoid those that sell mainly ready-to-eat products.\n7. Develop, practise, share, and enjoy your skills in food preparation and cooking.\n8. Decide as a family to share cooking responsibilities and dedicate enough time for health-supporting meals.\n9. When you dine out, choose restaurants that serve freshly made dishes. Avoid fast-food chains.\n10. Be critical of food-industry advertising.\n\n\n## Climate change and health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Outline map of the Amazon biome (white outline) and Amazon basin (light blue outline)\nThe WHO Country Report on Climate and Health - 2015 [29] placed Brazil as an important and unique player in climate change for being economically and environmentally relevant. It is among the largest economies in the world and at least 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in its territory.  \n\n\nThe main vulnerabilities posed by climate change in this report were \"risk of coastal flooding, reduced water availability, health risks associated with heat stress, and interference in climate sensitive vector borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue\".[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian Amazon\nAnother threat that could be softened by decarbonization is outdoor air pollution, which is mainly a consequence of the use of fossil fuels for energy generation and transportation. It poses a major risk for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological diseases and cancers, particularly for the population living in the urban areas. In Brazil, between 2010 and 2012, 4 out of the 5 most populated cities which had the information about air pollution available were above the annual mean for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels of 10 µg/m3 from the WHO guideline.[29]\n\n\nInland river flood risk can also be more frequent and affect broader areas in a high emission scenario, putting additional 78,600 people at risk of drowning, food insecurity, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, infectious diseases outbreaks and socio-economic changes.[29]\n\n\nIn 2016, Brazil developed a National Adaptation Plan to Climate Change, coordinated by the Ministry of Environment and with the participation of 26 Federal Government Institutions, among then, the Ministry of Health. Other agents from civil-society, private-sector and the state also contributed to the writing.[30]\n\n\nUnder the section of health and climate change, this plan focused on 4 main health-related risks associated to climate: natural disasters, air pollution, unavailability and quality of water resources and climate sensitive infectious diseases. For each risk, they analyzed vulnerabilities and potential impacts in the population and in the health system. Further on, the document provided guidance and strategies focusing on evidence and information management, awareness and education, potential alliances, and adaptation measures.\n\n\nIn December 2020, Brazil submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, with the compromise of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 37% until 2025 and 43% until 2030, relative to 2005.[31]\n\n\nNevertheless, as for September 2021, the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) rated Brazilian response to mitigate climate change as *Insufficient.* The underlying reasons are challenges faced by the country to keep COVID-19 under control, increasing deforestation rate trends and unsatisfactory policies for halting emissions growth and support the energy transition to a greener and more sustainable one.[32][33]\n\n\nEven so, in May 2021, seven Brazilian-healthcare institutions (out of 43 in the world so far) joined the Race to Zero campaign, a United Nations initiative to promote leadership and ramp up the move to achieve *net zero* and a healthier, greener, and sustainable economy. Many Brazilian companies and cities are also committed to this initiative as a global effort to hasten Government's contributions to achieve the Paris Agreement.[34][35]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Healthcare in Brazil\n* Sistema Único de Saúde\n* HIV/AIDS in Brazil\n* Education in Brazil\n* Demography of Brazil\n* Brazilian traditional medicine\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Lobato, Lenaura. \"Reorganizing the Health Care System in Brazil\".

In 1915 life expectancy at birth was 34 years. The cholera epidemic of 1910 killed 100,000 people. A typhus epidemic between 1918 and 1922 caused 2.5 million deaths, and doctors were particularly affected. There was an outbreak of malaria in 1920. The Institute of Tropical Medicine in Moscow instituted a programme of registration of cases and free distribution of quinine. The famine of 1921-1922 caused widespread starvation. As many as 27 million people were affected. Another cholera outbreak between 1921 and 1923 caused an estimated 13 million deaths.[4] By 1926 life expectancy had reached 31 years.[5]\n\n\n\n### Post-Soviet era[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2013, the average life expectancy in Russia was 65.1 years for males and 76.5 years for females.[6] The average Russian life expectancy of 71.6[7] years at birth is nearly 5 years shorter than the overall average figure for the European Union or the United States.[8]\n\n\nThe biggest factor contributing to this relatively low life expectancy for males is a high mortality rate among working-age males from preventable causes (e.g., alcohol poisoning, stress, smoking, traffic accidents, violent crimes)[*citation needed*]. Mortality among Russian men has risen by 60% since 1991, four to five times higher than the European average.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs a result of the large difference in life expectancy between men and women (the greatest in the world), the gender imbalance remains to this day and there are 0.859 males for every female in Russia.[9]\n\n\n\n## Major health issues[edit]\n\n\n### Common causes of death[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, 1,185,993, or 57% of all deaths in Russia were caused by cardiovascular disease. The second leading cause of death was cancer which claimed 289,257 lives (14%). External causes of death such as suicide (1.8%), road accidents (1.7%), murders (1.1%), accidental alcohol poisoning (1.1%), and accidental drowning (0.5%), claimed 244,463 lives in total (11%). Other major causes of death were diseases of the digestive system (4.3%), respiratory disease (3.8%), infectious and parasitic diseases (1.6%), and tuberculosis (1.2%).[10]\n\n\nThe infant mortality rate in 2008 was 8.5 deaths per 1,000, down from 9.6 in 2007. Since the Soviet collapse, there has been a dramatic rise in both cases of and deaths from tuberculosis, with the disease being particularly widespread amongst prison inmates.[11]\n\n\n\n### Smoking[edit]\n\n\nUntil 2007, Russia was the world leader in smoking.[*citation needed*] According to a survey reported in 2010 by Russia’s Health and Social Development Ministry, 43.9 million adults in Russia are smokers. Among Russians aged 19 to 44 years, 7 in 10 men smoke and 4 in 10 women smoke.[12] It is estimated that 330,000-400,000 people die in Russia each year due to smoking-related diseases. A smoking ban was introduced in 2014.\n\n\n\n### Alcohol consumption[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alcoholism in Russia\n\nAlcohol consumption and alcoholism are major problems in Russia.\nIt is estimated that Russians drink 15 litres (26 pints) of pure alcohol each year. This number is nearly 3 times as much as it was in 1990.[13] It has even been reported that excessive alcohol consumption is to blame for nearly half of all premature deaths in Russia.[14]\n\n\nA recent study blamed alcohol for more than half the deaths (52%) among Russians aged 15 to 54 from 1990 to 2001.[15] For the same demographic, this compares to 4% of deaths for the rest of the world.[16]\n\n\n\n### HIV/AIDS[edit]\n\n\nMain article: HIV/AIDS in Russia\n\nHIV/AIDS, virtually non-existent in the Soviet era, rapidly spread following the collapse, mainly through the explosive growth of intravenous drug use.[17] According to a 2008 report by UNAIDS, the HIV epidemic in Russia continues to grow, but at a slower pace than in the late 1990s. At the end of December 2007 the number of registered HIV cases in Russia was 416,113, with 42,770 new registered cases that year. The actual number of people living with HIV in Russia is estimated to be about 940,000.[18] In 2007, 83% of HIV infections in Russia were registered among injecting drug users, 6% among sex workers, and 5% among prisoners.[19] However, there is clear evidence of a significant rise in heterosexual transmission[*citation needed*]. In 2007, 93.19% of adults and children with advanced HIV infection were receiving antiretroviral therapy.[18][20]\n\n\nIn April 2006, the State Council met with the Russian President to set goals for developing a strategy for responding to AIDS. This involved improving coordination, through the creation of a high-level multisectoral governmental commission on AIDS; and establishing a unified monitoring and evaluation system. A new Federal AIDS Program for 2007 - 2011 was also developed and adopted. Federal funding for the national AIDS response in 2006 had increased more than twentyfold compared to 2005, and the 2007 budget doubled that of 2006, adding to the already substantial funds provided by the main donor organizations.[20]\n\n\nCoordination of activities in responding to AIDS remains a challenge for Russia, despite increased efforts. In 2006, treatment for some patients was interrupted due to delays in tender procedures and unexpected difficulties with customs. Additionally, lack of full commitment to an in-depth program for education on sex and drugs in schools hinders effective prevention programs for children.[20]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 (2020-2022)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in Russia\n\n### Suicide[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Suicide in Russia\n\nIn 2008, suicide claimed 38,406 lives in Russia.[21] With a rate of 27.1 suicides per 100,000 people, Russia has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, although it has been steadily decreasing since it peaked at around 40 per 100,000 in the mid-late 90s,[22] including a 30% drop from 2001 to 2006. In 2007 about 22% of all suicides were committed by people aged 40–49, and almost six times as many Russian males commit suicide than females.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHeavy alcohol use is a significant factor in the suicide rate, with an estimated half of all suicides a result of alcohol abuse. This is evidenced by the fact that Russia's suicide rate since the mid-90s has declined alongside per capita alcohol consumption, despite the economic crises since then; alcohol consumption is more of a factor than economic conditions.[23]\n\n\n\n### Tuberculosis[edit]\n\n\nThe pulmonary TB death rate in Russia around 1900 was 4 per 1000, more than double the rate in London. The All Russia League for the Struggle Against TB was set up in 1909. In 1919 the Commissariat of Public Health established a TB Commission. The incidence of tuberculosis in Moscow was about three times that in London in 1922. The director of the Institute of Control of Serums and Vaccines in Russia, Tarasevich, brought a serum of the BCG vaccine from the Pasteur Institute in 1925 and a vaccination programme started shortly afterwards, starting with children in homes with an active TB patient, but there was initially very low take up. It was not until the 1930s that rates increased significantly.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Climate change in Russia § Health impacts.[edit]\nClimate change has the potential to affect human health in several ways, both directly and indirectly, through for example, extreme heatwaves, fires, floods or insect-borne diseases.\n\n\nThe predicted increases in average annual temperatures in most parts of Russia, especially the western and south-western regions, imply more frequent extreme heatwaves and forest fires.[25] For example, during the heatwave that affected western Russia in 2010, temperatures in Moscow reached 38.2 °C, the highest temperature since records began 130 years ago. In addition, during the heatwave there were 33 consecutive days of temperatures above 30 °C in the city, increasing the incidence of heat-related deaths and health problems, and leading to forest fires.[26] The heatwave and wildfires of 2010 in Russia resulted in around 14,000 heat and air-pollution related deaths, as well as around 25% crop failure that year, more than 10,000 km2 of burned area and around 15 billion US dollars of economic losses.[27][28] Throughout the 21st century, extreme heatwaves such as that of 2010 are likely to occur more often.[25]\n\n\nIn consequence of the 2006, 2003 and 2010 heatwaves in Europe and Russia, the IPCC (2012) has outlined mitigation strategies, including approaches to reduce impacts on public health, assessing heat mortality, communication of risk, education and adapting urban infrastructure to better withstand heatwaves (by for example increasing vegetation cover in cities, increasing albedo in cities and increasing insulation of homes).[29]\n\n\nWith changes in temperature and precipitation patterns as a result of climate change, the distribution and occurrence of various disease-bearing insects will also change. For example, mosquitos carrying malaria are expected to pose an increasing threat in Russia in the 21st century.[30] In the Moscow region, the onset of higher average daily temperatures early on in the year has already led to a rapid increase in malaria cases. This trend is projected to continue, as higher average temperatures extend the range of mosquitos northwards.[31] Similarly, prevalence of tick-borne diseases is also projected to increase in Russia in the 21st century, as a result of climate change and changing distribution range of ticks.[25] Sandfly-borne diseases, such as Leishmaniasis, could also expand in Europe and Russia as a result of climate change and increased average temperatures making transmission suitable in northern latitudes.[32]\n\n\n\nFloods may also pose and increased risk as a result of climate change in the 21st century. An average increase in precipitation in many areas of Russia as well as rapid snow and glacier melting due to rising temperatures, can all increase the risk of flooding.[25]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Healthcare in Russia\n* List of federal subjects of Russia by life expectancy\n* List of federal subjects of Russia by incidence of substance abuse\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Leonard, William R (April 2002). \"Declining growth status of indigenous Siberian children in post-Soviet Russia\". *Human Biology*. p. 1.

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\nEstimation of the World Bank Group for 2021.[3][4][5] Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries

expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries &territories\n | 2019\n | 2021\n | 2019→2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | Male\n | Female\n | Gendergap |

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\nEstimation of the World Bank Group for 2021.[3][4][5] Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries

expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries &territories\n | 2019\n | 2021\n | 2019→2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | Male\n | Female\n | Gendergap |

Open the original svg-file and hover over a bubble to show its data. The square of the bubbles is proportional to country population based on estimation of the UN.\n**Life expectancy** is a statistical measure of the estimate of the span of a life. The most commonly used measure is *life expectancy at birth* (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. *Cohort* LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. *Period* LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort[1][2] assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[3] National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of *period* LEB.\n\n\nIn the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, human LEB was 26 years[*citation needed*]; in 2010, world LEB was 67.2 years. In recent years, LEB in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is 49, while LEB in Japan is 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people.[4] A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\nAggregate population measures—such as the proportion of the population in various age groups—are also used alongside individual-based measures—such as formal life expectancy—when analyzing population structure and dynamics. Pre-modern societies had universally higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies at every age for both males and females. This example is relatively rare.\n\n\nLife expectancy, longevity, and maximum lifespan are not synonymous. Longevity refers to the relatively long lifespan of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Mathematically, life expectancy is denoted \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e\\_{x}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle e_{x}}](image) [a] and is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), with a particular mortality.[7] Because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or after the expected survival.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology,[8] and in life tables (also known as actuarial tables). The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,[9] though the related term[*dubious – discuss*] shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt,[10] Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.[11]\n\n\n\n## Human patterns[edit]\n\n\n### Maximum[edit]\n\n\nThe longest verified lifespan for any human is that of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived.[12] A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.[13] According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan.[14][15] However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns.[16]\n\n\nRecords of human lifespan above age 100 are highly susceptible to errors.[16] For example, the previous world-record holder for human lifespan, Carrie C. White was uncovered as a simple typographic error after more than two decades.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Variation over time[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Longevity and List of countries by past life expectancy\n\nThe following information is derived from the 1961 *Encyclopædia Britannica* and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Era | Life expectancy at birth in years | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Paleolithic | 22–33[17] | Based on the data from modern hunter-gatherer populations, it is estimated that at 15, life expectancy another 39 years (54 years total). There was a 60% probability of surviving until age 15.[18] |\n| Neolithic | 20[19] – 33[20] | Based on Early Neolithic data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–33 years.[21] |\n| Bronze Age and Iron Age[22] | 26 | Based on Early and Middle Bronze Age data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–36 years.[21] |\n| Classical Greece[23] | 25[24] – 28[25] | Based on Athens Agora and Corinth data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 37–41 years.[21] Most Greeks and Romans died young. About half of all children died before adolescence. Those who survived to the age of 30 had a reasonable chance of reaching 50 or 60. The truly elderly, however, were rare. Because so many died in childhood, life expectancy at birth was probably between 20 and 30 years.[26] |\n| Ancient Rome | 20–33\n[27][28][29][26][17][30]\n | Data is lacking, but computer models provide the estimate. If a person survived to age 20, they could expect to live around 30 years more. Life expectancy was probably slightly longer for women than men.[31]\nWhen infant mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 67[27]–75% who survived the first year), life expectancy is around 34–41 more years (i.e. expected to live to 35–42). When child mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 55-65% who survived to age 5), life expectancy is around 40–45 (i.e. age 45–50).[29] The ~50% that reached age 10 could also expect to reach ~45-50;[27] at 15 to ~48–54; at 40 to ~60;[27] at 50 to ~64–68; at 60 to ~70–72; at 70 to ~76–77.[29][31]\n |\n| Wang clan of China, 1st c. AD – 1749 | 35 | For the 60% that survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortalities), life expectancy rose to ~35.[32][33] |\n| Early Middle Ages (Europe, from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century) | 30–35 | Life expectancy for those of both sexes who survived birth averaged about 30–35 years. However, if a Gaulish boy made it past age 20, he might expect to live 25 more years, while a woman at age 20 could normally expect about 17 more years. Anyone who survived until 40 had a good chance at another 15 to 20 years.[34] |\n| Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica[35] | >40 | The average Aztec life expectancy was 41.2 years for men and 42.1 for women.\n |\n| Late medieval English peerage[36][37] | 30–33[30] | In Europe, around one-third of infants died in their first year.[17] Once children reached the age of 10, their life expectancy was 32.2 years, and for those who survived to 25, the remaining life expectancy was 23.3 years. Such estimates reflected the life expectancy of adult males from the higher ranks of English society in the Middle Ages, and were similar to that computed for monks of the Christ Church in Canterbury during the 15th century.[30] At age 21, life expectancy of an aristocrat was an additional 43 years (total age 64).[38] |\n| Early modern Britain (16th – 18th century)[22] | 33–40 | For males in the 18th century it was 34 years.[39] For 15-year-old girls: around the 15th – 16th century it was ~33 years (48 total), and in the 18th century it was ~42 (57 total).[40] |\n| 18th-century England[41][17] | 25–40 | For most of the century it ranged from 35 to 40; however, in the 1720s it dipped as low as 25.[41] For 15-year-old girls, it was ~42 (57 total).[40] During the second half of the century it was ~37,[42] while for the elite it passed 40 and approached 50.[32] |\n| Pre-Champlain Canadian Maritimes[43] | 60\n | Samuel de Champlain wrote that in his visits to Mi'kmaq and Huron communities, he met people over 100 years old. Daniel Paul attributes the incredible lifespan in the region to low stress and a healthy diet of lean meats, diverse vegetables, and legumes.[44] |\n| 18th-century Prussia[39] | 24.7 | For males.[39] |\n| 18th-century France[39] | 27.5–30 | For males:[39] 24.8 years in 1740–1749, 27.9 years in 1750–1759, 33.9 years in 1800–1809.[33] |\n| 18th-century American colonies[17] | 28 | Massachusetts colonists who reached the age of 50 could expect to live until 71, and those who were still alive at 60 could expect to reach 75.\n |\n| Beginning of the 19th century[41] | ~29 | Demographic research suggests that at the beginning of the 19th century, no country in the world had a life expectancy longer than 40 years. India was ~25 years, while Belgium was ~40 years.[41] For Europe as a whole, it was ~33 years.[42] |\n| Early 19th-century England[22][41][32] | 40 | For the 84% who survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortality), the average age was ~46[32]–48. If they reached 20, then it was ~60; if 50, then ~70; if 70, then ~80.[41] For a 15-year-old girl it was ~60–65.[40] For the upper-class, LEB rose from ~45 to 50.[32]\nLess than half of the people born in the mid-19th century made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, 97% of the people born in 21st century England and Wales can expect to live longer than 50 years.[41]\n |\n| 19th-century British India[45] | 25.4 |  |\n| 19th-century world average[41] | 28.5–32 | Over the course of the century: Europe rose from ~33 to 43, the Americas from ~35 to 41, Oceania ~35 to 48, Asia ~28, Africa 26.[41] In 1820s France, LEB was ~38, and for the 80% that survived, it rose to ~47. For Moscow serfs, LEB was ~34, and for the 66% that survived, it rose to ~36.[32] Western Europe in 1830 was ~33 years, while for the people of Hau-Lou in China, it was ~40.[42] The LEB for a 10-year-old in Sweden rose from ~44 to ~54.[41] |\n| 1900 world average[46] | 31–32[41] | Around 48 years in Oceania, 43 in Europe, and 41 in the Americas.[41] Around 47 in the U.S.[17] and around 48 for 15-year-old girls in England.[40] |\n| 1950 world average[46] | 45.7–48[41] | Around 60 years in Europe, North America, Oceania, Japan, and parts of South America; but only 41 in Asia and 36 in Africa. Norway led with 72, while in Mali it was merely 26.[41] |\n| 2019–2020 world average | 72.6–73.2 [41][47][48] | * Females: 75.6 years\n* Males: 70.8 years\n* Range: ~54 (Central African Republic) – 85.3 (Hong Kong)[48]\n |\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy[49] increases with age already achieved.\nLife expectancy increases with age as the individual survives the higher mortality rates associated with childhood. For instance, the table above gives the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles as 30. Having survived to the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:[38]\n\n\n\n* 1200–1300: to age 64\n* 1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)\n* 1400–1500: to age 69\n* 1500–1550: to age 71\n\n\n17th-century English life expectancy was only about 35 years, largely because infant and child mortality remained high. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia,[50] and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood.[51] During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[52] The under-5 mortality rate in London decreased from 74.5% (in 1730–1749) to 31.8% (in 1810–1829).[53][54]\n\n\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic,[55] the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.[56]\n\n\n\n### Regional variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in 1800, 1950, and 2015 – visualization by Our World in Data\nHuman beings are expected to live on average 30–40 years in Eswatini[57] and 82.6 years in Japan.[b] An analysis published in 2011 in *The Lancet* attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities, public health, and diet.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plot of life expectancy vs. GDP per capita in 2009. This phenomenon is known as the Preston curve.\n![](image)Graphs of life expectancy at birth for some sub-Saharan countries showing the fall in the 1990s primarily due to the HIV pandemic[61]\nThere are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet. The impact of AIDS on life expectancy is particularly notable in many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:[62]\n\n\n\n* 70.7 years instead of 31.6 years, Botswana\n* 69.9 years instead of 41.5 years, South Africa\n* 70.5 years instead of 31.8 years, Zimbabwe\n\n\nActual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011. In South Africa, life expectancy was 63 in 1990, 57 in 2000, and 58 in 2011. And in Zimbabwe, life expectancy was 60 in 1990, 43 in 2000, and 54 in 2011.[63]\n\n\nDuring the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.[64][65]\n\n\nIn the United States, African-American people have shorter life expectancies than their European-American counterparts. For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993.[66] In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.[67] The life expectancy of Hispanic-Americans is 81.2 years.[66] According to the new government reports in the US, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than in 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.[68]\n\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.[69]\n\n\n\n### Economic circumstances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy is higher in rich countries with low economic inequality.[70]\n![](image)Life expectancy vs healthcare spending of rich OECD countries. US average of $10,447 in 2018.[71]\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.[72] In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away.[73][74]\n\n\nA 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy.[75] However, in contrast, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually *increased* during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general.[76] The authors suggest that when people are working at a more extreme degree during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.\n\n\n\n### Sex differences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pink: Countries where female life expectancy at birth is higher than males. Blue: A few countries in southern Africa where females have shorter lives due to AIDS.[77]\nIn the present, female human life expectancy is greater than that of males, despite females having higher morbidity rates (see Health survival paradox). There are many potential reasons for this. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.[78] Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war, or car wrecks) or intentional (suicide).[78] Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease.[12] These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer. In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age.\n\n\nA paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses.[79] This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates.[80][81][82] Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds (910 grams)), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005.[83] Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.[84]\n\n\nSome argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger-sized individuals within a species tend, on average, to have shorter lives.[85][86] This biological difference[*clarification needed*] occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.[12]\n\n\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben's study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males.[87] Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.[88]\n\n\nOne recent suggestion is that mitochondrial mutations which shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore, such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.[89][90]\n\n\nAnother explanation is the unguarded X hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, one reason for why the average lifespan of males isn't as long as that of females––by 18% on average, according to the study––is that they have a Y chromosome which can't protect an individual from harmful genes expressed on the X chromosome, while a duplicate X chromosome, as present in female organisms, can ensure harmful genes aren't expressed.[91][92]\n\n\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.[93] Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50–70.[94]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Genetics of aging\n\nThe heritability of lifespan is estimated to be less than 10%, meaning the majority of variation in lifespan is attributable due to differences in environment rather than genetic variation.[95] However, researchers have identified regions of the genome which can influence the length of life and the number of years lived in good health. For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease.[96] The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the ε4 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity are highly genetically correlated.\"[97]\nIn July 2020, scientists identified 10 genomic loci with consistent effects across multiple lifespan-related traits, including healthspan, lifespan, and longevity.[97] The genes affected by variation in these loci highlighted haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. This study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans.[98]\n\n\nA follow-up study which investigated the genetics of frailty and self-rated health in addition to healthspan, lifespan, and longevity also highlighted haem metabolism as an important pathway, and found genetic variants which lower blood protein levels of LPA and VCAM1 were associated with increased healthy lifespan.[99]\n\n\n\n### Centenarians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Centenarian\n\nIn developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050.[100] Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane Prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.[101]\n\n\nIn the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants).[102]\n\n\n\n### Mental illness[edit]\n\n\nMental illness is reported to occur in approximately 18% of the average American population.[103][104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in the seriously mentally ill is much shorter than the general population.[105]\nThe mentally ill have been shown to have a 10- to 25-year reduction in life expectancy.[106] Generally, the reduction of lifespan in the mentally ill population compared to the mentally stable population has been studied and documented.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nThe greater mortality of people with mental disorders may be due to death from injury, from co-morbid conditions, or medication side effects.[112] For instance, psychiatric medications can increase the risk of developing diabetes.[113][114][115][116] It has been shown that the psychiatric medication olanzapine can increase risk of developing agranulocytosis, among other comorbidities.[117][118] Psychiatric medicines also affect the gastrointestinal tract; the mentally ill have a four times risk of gastrointestinal disease.[119][120][121]\n\n\nAs of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found an increased risk of death in the mentally ill.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n### Other illnesses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Post-COVID life expectancy in the US, UK, Netherlands, and Austria\nThe life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly 10–20 years.[125][126] People over 60 years old with Alzheimer's disease have about a 50% life expectancy of 3–10 years.[127] Other demographics that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients[128] and the obese.[129]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nEducation on all levels has been shown to be strongly associated with increased life expectancy.[130] This association may be due partly to higher income,[131] which can lead to increased life expectancy. Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.[130]\n\n\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher[*dubious – discuss*] for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education.[130] In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\n\n\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.[132]\n\n\n\n## Evolution and aging rate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life history theory\n\nVarious species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms which—by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle—live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span.[133] That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad;[134] however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.[135][136]\n\n\nOne prominent and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction.[137] Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span from a very limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy.[138][139][140] That is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long.[141] Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe ability of skin fibroblasts to perform DNA repair after UV irradiation was measured in shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human.[142] It was found that DNA repair capability increased systematically with species life span. Since this original study in 1974, at least 14 additional studies were performed on mammals to test this correlation.[143] In all, but two of these studies, lifespan correlated with DNA repair levels, suggesting that DNA repair capability contributes to life expectancy.[143]\n\n\nIn a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between investment of the animal in reproduction and its life span.[144]\n\n\n\n## Calculation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Life table § The mathematics\n\n![](image)A survival tree to explain the calculations of life-expectancy.

For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the age-specific death probability at 90 would be 10%. This probability describes the *likelihood* of dying at that age, and is not the *rate* at which people of that age die.[c] It can be shown that\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\np\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nq\n\nx\n+\nk\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\np\n\nx\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\nk\n+\n1\n\n\n\np\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {}\\_{k}p\\_{x}\\,q\\_{x+k}={}\\_{k}p\\_{x}-{}\\_{k+1}p\\_{x}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {}_{k}p_{x}\\,q_{x+k}={}_{k}p_{x}-{}_{k+1}p_{x}}](image) |  | **(1)** |\n\n\nThe *curtate future lifetime*, denoted \n\n\n\nK\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K(x)}\n\n![{\\displaystyle K(x)}](image), is a discrete random variable representing the remaining lifetime at age \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), rounded down to whole years.

It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\nThe starting point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.[147] The most common modern methods include:\n\n\n\n* fitting a mathematical formula (such as the Gompertz function, or an extension of it) to the data.\n* looking at an established mortality table derived from a larger population and making a simple adjustment to it (such as multiplying by a constant factor) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively small amounts of data.)\n* looking at the mortality rates actually experienced at each age and applying a piecewise model (such as by cubic splines) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively large amounts of data.)\n\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.[12]\n\n\n\n## Healthy life expectancy[edit]\n\n\nTo assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called **Healthy life expectancy** (**HALE**), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.[150][151] Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n\n\n\n![Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries](image)Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\". Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.[152]\n\n\n\n## Forecasting[edit]\n\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n1. Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.\n2. Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[154]\n\n\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).[155] There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).[156]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Remaining\" life expectancy—expected number of remaining years of life as a function of *current age*—is used in retirement income planning.[49]\nLife expectancy is commonly confused with the average age an adult could expect to live. This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\nMaximum life span is an individual-specific concept, and therefore is an upper bound rather than an average.[157] Science author Christopher Wanjek writes, \"[H]as the human race increased its life span? Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.\" The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant.[157] Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).[157]\n\n\nHowever, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, \"[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.\"[160]\n\n\nLife expectancy can also create popular misconceptions about at what age a certain population may expect to die at. The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n### Increasing life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n* Strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS)\n* John Sperling\n* Life extension\n* Longevity\n* Rejuvenation\n* Public health\n* Infant mortality\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In standard actuarial notation, *ex* refers to the expected future lifetime of *(x)* in whole years, while *eͦx* (with a ring above the *e*) denotes the complete expected future lifetime of *(x)*, including the fraction.\n2. **^** Japan's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn.[58]\n3. **^**  Note the different units: a probability is unit-less, whereas a mortality rate has units (such as deaths per population per year).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\"Life Expectancy\" – What does this actually mean?\". *Our World in Data*.

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\nEstimation of the World Bank Group for 2021.[3][4][5] Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries

expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries &territories\n | 2019\n | 2021\n | 2019→2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | Male\n | Female\n | Gendergap |

The most commonly used measure is *life expectancy at birth* (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. *Cohort* LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. *Period* LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort[1][2] assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[3] National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of *period* LEB.\n\n\nIn the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, human LEB was 26 years[*citation needed*]; in 2010, world LEB was 67.2 years. In recent years, LEB in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) is 49, while LEB in Japan is 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people.[4] A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but perhaps not a 60-year one).\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, infant mortality was approximately 40–60% of the total mortality. Excluding child mortality, the average life expectancy during the 12th–19th centuries was approximately 55 years. If a person survived childhood, they had about a 50% chance of living 50–55 years, instead of only 25–40 years.[5] As of 2016, the overall worldwide life expectancy had reached the highest level that has been measured in modern times.[6]\n\n\nAggregate population measures—such as the proportion of the population in various age groups—are also used alongside individual-based measures—such as formal life expectancy—when analyzing population structure and dynamics. Pre-modern societies had universally higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies at every age for both males and females. This example is relatively rare.\n\n\nLife expectancy, longevity, and maximum lifespan are not synonymous. Longevity refers to the relatively long lifespan of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Mathematically, life expectancy is denoted \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e\\_{x}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle e_{x}}](image) [a] and is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), with a particular mortality.[7] Because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or after the expected survival.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology,[8] and in life tables (also known as actuarial tables). The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,[9] though the related term[*dubious – discuss*] shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt,[10] Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.[11]\n\n\n\n## Human patterns[edit]\n\n\n### Maximum[edit]\n\n\nThe longest verified lifespan for any human is that of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived.[12] A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.[13] According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for limit on human lifespan.[14][15] However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns.[16]\n\n\nRecords of human lifespan above age 100 are highly susceptible to errors.[16] For example, the previous world-record holder for human lifespan, Carrie C. White was uncovered as a simple typographic error after more than two decades.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Variation over time[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Longevity and List of countries by past life expectancy\n\nThe following information is derived from the 1961 *Encyclopædia Britannica* and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\n\n\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Era | Life expectancy at birth in years | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Paleolithic | 22–33[17] | Based on the data from modern hunter-gatherer populations, it is estimated that at 15, life expectancy another 39 years (54 years total). There was a 60% probability of surviving until age 15.[18] |\n| Neolithic | 20[19] – 33[20] | Based on Early Neolithic data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–33 years.[21] |\n| Bronze Age and Iron Age[22] | 26 | Based on Early and Middle Bronze Age data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 28–36 years.[21] |\n| Classical Greece[23] | 25[24] – 28[25] | Based on Athens Agora and Corinth data, total life expectancy at 15 would be 37–41 years.[21] Most Greeks and Romans died young. About half of all children died before adolescence. Those who survived to the age of 30 had a reasonable chance of reaching 50 or 60. The truly elderly, however, were rare. Because so many died in childhood, life expectancy at birth was probably between 20 and 30 years.[26] |\n| Ancient Rome | 20–33\n[27][28][29][26][17][30]\n | Data is lacking, but computer models provide the estimate. If a person survived to age 20, they could expect to live around 30 years more. Life expectancy was probably slightly longer for women than men.[31]\nWhen infant mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 67[27]–75% who survived the first year), life expectancy is around 34–41 more years (i.e. expected to live to 35–42). When child mortality is factored out (i.e. counting only the 55-65% who survived to age 5), life expectancy is around 40–45 (i.e. age 45–50).[29] The ~50% that reached age 10 could also expect to reach ~45-50;[27] at 15 to ~48–54; at 40 to ~60;[27] at 50 to ~64–68; at 60 to ~70–72; at 70 to ~76–77.[29][31]\n |\n| Wang clan of China, 1st c. AD – 1749 | 35 | For the 60% that survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortalities), life expectancy rose to ~35.[32][33] |\n| Early Middle Ages (Europe, from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century) | 30–35 | Life expectancy for those of both sexes who survived birth averaged about 30–35 years. However, if a Gaulish boy made it past age 20, he might expect to live 25 more years, while a woman at age 20 could normally expect about 17 more years. Anyone who survived until 40 had a good chance at another 15 to 20 years.[34] |\n| Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica[35] | >40 | The average Aztec life expectancy was 41.2 years for men and 42.1 for women.\n |\n| Late medieval English peerage[36][37] | 30–33[30] | In Europe, around one-third of infants died in their first year.[17] Once children reached the age of 10, their life expectancy was 32.2 years, and for those who survived to 25, the remaining life expectancy was 23.3 years. Such estimates reflected the life expectancy of adult males from the higher ranks of English society in the Middle Ages, and were similar to that computed for monks of the Christ Church in Canterbury during the 15th century.[30] At age 21, life expectancy of an aristocrat was an additional 43 years (total age 64).[38] |\n| Early modern Britain (16th – 18th century)[22] | 33–40 | For males in the 18th century it was 34 years.[39] For 15-year-old girls: around the 15th – 16th century it was ~33 years (48 total), and in the 18th century it was ~42 (57 total).[40] |\n| 18th-century England[41][17] | 25–40 | For most of the century it ranged from 35 to 40; however, in the 1720s it dipped as low as 25.[41] For 15-year-old girls, it was ~42 (57 total).[40] During the second half of the century it was ~37,[42] while for the elite it passed 40 and approached 50.[32] |\n| Pre-Champlain Canadian Maritimes[43] | 60\n | Samuel de Champlain wrote that in his visits to Mi'kmaq and Huron communities, he met people over 100 years old. Daniel Paul attributes the incredible lifespan in the region to low stress and a healthy diet of lean meats, diverse vegetables, and legumes.[44] |\n| 18th-century Prussia[39] | 24.7 | For males.[39] |\n| 18th-century France[39] | 27.5–30 | For males:[39] 24.8 years in 1740–1749, 27.9 years in 1750–1759, 33.9 years in 1800–1809.[33] |\n| 18th-century American colonies[17] | 28 | Massachusetts colonists who reached the age of 50 could expect to live until 71, and those who were still alive at 60 could expect to reach 75.\n |\n| Beginning of the 19th century[41] | ~29 | Demographic research suggests that at the beginning of the 19th century, no country in the world had a life expectancy longer than 40 years. India was ~25 years, while Belgium was ~40 years.[41] For Europe as a whole, it was ~33 years.[42] |\n| Early 19th-century England[22][41][32] | 40 | For the 84% who survived the first year (i.e. excluding infant mortality), the average age was ~46[32]–48. If they reached 20, then it was ~60; if 50, then ~70; if 70, then ~80.[41] For a 15-year-old girl it was ~60–65.[40] For the upper-class, LEB rose from ~45 to 50.[32]\nLess than half of the people born in the mid-19th century made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, 97% of the people born in 21st century England and Wales can expect to live longer than 50 years.[41]\n |\n| 19th-century British India[45] | 25.4 |  |\n| 19th-century world average[41] | 28.5–32 | Over the course of the century: Europe rose from ~33 to 43, the Americas from ~35 to 41, Oceania ~35 to 48, Asia ~28, Africa 26.[41] In 1820s France, LEB was ~38, and for the 80% that survived, it rose to ~47. For Moscow serfs, LEB was ~34, and for the 66% that survived, it rose to ~36.[32] Western Europe in 1830 was ~33 years, while for the people of Hau-Lou in China, it was ~40.[42] The LEB for a 10-year-old in Sweden rose from ~44 to ~54.[41] |\n| 1900 world average[46] | 31–32[41] | Around 48 years in Oceania, 43 in Europe, and 41 in the Americas.[41] Around 47 in the U.S.[17] and around 48 for 15-year-old girls in England.[40] |\n| 1950 world average[46] | 45.7–48[41] | Around 60 years in Europe, North America, Oceania, Japan, and parts of South America; but only 41 in Asia and 36 in Africa. Norway led with 72, while in Mali it was merely 26.[41] |\n| 2019–2020 world average | 72.6–73.2 [41][47][48] | * Females: 75.6 years\n* Males: 70.8 years\n* Range: ~54 (Central African Republic) – 85.3 (Hong Kong)[48]\n |\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy[49] increases with age already achieved.\nLife expectancy increases with age as the individual survives the higher mortality rates associated with childhood. For instance, the table above gives the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles as 30. Having survived to the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:[38]\n\n\n\n* 1200–1300: to age 64\n* 1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)\n* 1400–1500: to age 69\n* 1500–1550: to age 71\n\n\n17th-century English life expectancy was only about 35 years, largely because infant and child mortality remained high. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia,[50] and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood.[51] During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[52] The under-5 mortality rate in London decreased from 74.5% (in 1730–1749) to 31.8% (in 1810–1829).[53][54]\n\n\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic,[55] the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.[56]\n\n\n\n### Regional variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in 1800, 1950, and 2015 – visualization by Our World in Data\nHuman beings are expected to live on average 30–40 years in Eswatini[57] and 82.6 years in Japan.[b] An analysis published in 2011 in *The Lancet* attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities, public health, and diet.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plot of life expectancy vs. GDP per capita in 2009. This phenomenon is known as the Preston curve.\n![](image)Graphs of life expectancy at birth for some sub-Saharan countries showing the fall in the 1990s primarily due to the HIV pandemic[61]\nThere are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet. The impact of AIDS on life expectancy is particularly notable in many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:[62]\n\n\n\n* 70.7 years instead of 31.6 years, Botswana\n* 69.9 years instead of 41.5 years, South Africa\n* 70.5 years instead of 31.8 years, Zimbabwe\n\n\nActual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011. In South Africa, life expectancy was 63 in 1990, 57 in 2000, and 58 in 2011. And in Zimbabwe, life expectancy was 60 in 1990, 43 in 2000, and 54 in 2011.[63]\n\n\nDuring the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.[64][65]\n\n\nIn the United States, African-American people have shorter life expectancies than their European-American counterparts. For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993.[66] In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.[67] The life expectancy of Hispanic-Americans is 81.2 years.[66] According to the new government reports in the US, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than in 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.[68]\n\n\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.[69]\n\n\n\n### Economic circumstances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy is higher in rich countries with low economic inequality.[70]\n![](image)Life expectancy vs healthcare spending of rich OECD countries. US average of $10,447 in 2018.[71]\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.[72] In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km (5.0 mi) away.[73][74]\n\n\nA 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy.[75] However, in contrast, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually *increased* during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general.[76] The authors suggest that when people are working at a more extreme degree during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\n\n\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.\n\n\n\n### Sex differences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pink: Countries where female life expectancy at birth is higher than males. Blue: A few countries in southern Africa where females have shorter lives due to AIDS.[77]\nIn the present, female human life expectancy is greater than that of males, despite females having higher morbidity rates (see Health survival paradox). There are many potential reasons for this. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.[78] Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war, or car wrecks) or intentional (suicide).[78] Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease.[12] These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer. In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age.\n\n\nA paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses.[79] This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates.[80][81][82] Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds (910 grams)), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005.[83] Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.[84]\n\n\nSome argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger-sized individuals within a species tend, on average, to have shorter lives.[85][86] This biological difference[*clarification needed*] occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.[12]\n\n\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben's study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males.[87] Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.[88]\n\n\nOne recent suggestion is that mitochondrial mutations which shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore, such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.[89][90]\n\n\nAnother explanation is the unguarded X hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, one reason for why the average lifespan of males isn't as long as that of females––by 18% on average, according to the study––is that they have a Y chromosome which can't protect an individual from harmful genes expressed on the X chromosome, while a duplicate X chromosome, as present in female organisms, can ensure harmful genes aren't expressed.[91][92]\n\n\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.[93] Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50–70.[94]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Genetics of aging\n\nThe heritability of lifespan is estimated to be less than 10%, meaning the majority of variation in lifespan is attributable due to differences in environment rather than genetic variation.[95] However, researchers have identified regions of the genome which can influence the length of life and the number of years lived in good health. For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease.[96] The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE ε4 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the ε4 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Healthspan, parental lifespan, and longevity are highly genetically correlated.\"[97]\nIn July 2020, scientists identified 10 genomic loci with consistent effects across multiple lifespan-related traits, including healthspan, lifespan, and longevity.[97] The genes affected by variation in these loci highlighted haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. This study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans.[98]\n\n\nA follow-up study which investigated the genetics of frailty and self-rated health in addition to healthspan, lifespan, and longevity also highlighted haem metabolism as an important pathway, and found genetic variants which lower blood protein levels of LPA and VCAM1 were associated with increased healthy lifespan.[99]\n\n\n\n### Centenarians[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Centenarian\n\nIn developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050.[100] Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane Prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.[101]\n\n\nIn the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants).[102]\n\n\n\n### Mental illness[edit]\n\n\nMental illness is reported to occur in approximately 18% of the average American population.[103][104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in the seriously mentally ill is much shorter than the general population.[105]\nThe mentally ill have been shown to have a 10- to 25-year reduction in life expectancy.[106] Generally, the reduction of lifespan in the mentally ill population compared to the mentally stable population has been studied and documented.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nThe greater mortality of people with mental disorders may be due to death from injury, from co-morbid conditions, or medication side effects.[112] For instance, psychiatric medications can increase the risk of developing diabetes.[113][114][115][116] It has been shown that the psychiatric medication olanzapine can increase risk of developing agranulocytosis, among other comorbidities.[117][118] Psychiatric medicines also affect the gastrointestinal tract; the mentally ill have a four times risk of gastrointestinal disease.[119][120][121]\n\n\nAs of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found an increased risk of death in the mentally ill.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n### Other illnesses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Post-COVID life expectancy in the US, UK, Netherlands, and Austria\nThe life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly 10–20 years.[125][126] People over 60 years old with Alzheimer's disease have about a 50% life expectancy of 3–10 years.[127] Other demographics that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients[128] and the obese.[129]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nEducation on all levels has been shown to be strongly associated with increased life expectancy.[130] This association may be due partly to higher income,[131] which can lead to increased life expectancy. Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.[130]\n\n\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher[*dubious – discuss*] for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education.[130] In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\n\n\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.[132]\n\n\n\n## Evolution and aging rate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life history theory\n\nVarious species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms which—by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle—live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span.[133] That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad;[134] however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.[135][136]\n\n\nOne prominent and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction.[137] Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span from a very limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy.[138][139][140] That is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long.[141] Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe ability of skin fibroblasts to perform DNA repair after UV irradiation was measured in shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human.[142] It was found that DNA repair capability increased systematically with species life span. Since this original study in 1974, at least 14 additional studies were performed on mammals to test this correlation.[143] In all, but two of these studies, lifespan correlated with DNA repair levels, suggesting that DNA repair capability contributes to life expectancy.[143]\n\n\nIn a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between investment of the animal in reproduction and its life span.[144]\n\n\n\n## Calculation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Life table § The mathematics\n\n![](image)A survival tree to explain the calculations of life-expectancy.

For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the age-specific death probability at 90 would be 10%. This probability describes the *likelihood* of dying at that age, and is not the *rate* at which people of that age die.[c] It can be shown that\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\np\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nq\n\nx\n+\nk\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\np\n\nx\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\nk\n+\n1\n\n\n\np\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {}\\_{k}p\\_{x}\\,q\\_{x+k}={}\\_{k}p\\_{x}-{}\\_{k+1}p\\_{x}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {}_{k}p_{x}\\,q_{x+k}={}_{k}p_{x}-{}_{k+1}p_{x}}](image) |  | **(1)** |\n\n\nThe *curtate future lifetime*, denoted \n\n\n\nK\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K(x)}\n\n![{\\displaystyle K(x)}](image), is a discrete random variable representing the remaining lifetime at age \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), rounded down to whole years.

It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\n\n\nThe starting point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used.[147] The most common modern methods include:\n\n\n\n* fitting a mathematical formula (such as the Gompertz function, or an extension of it) to the data.\n* looking at an established mortality table derived from a larger population and making a simple adjustment to it (such as multiplying by a constant factor) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively small amounts of data.)\n* looking at the mortality rates actually experienced at each age and applying a piecewise model (such as by cubic splines) to fit the data. (In cases of relatively large amounts of data.)\n\n\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.[148] The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.[9]\n\n\nIt is important to note that the life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee–Carter model.[149]\n\n\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.[12]\n\n\n\n## Healthy life expectancy[edit]\n\n\nTo assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called **Healthy life expectancy** (**HALE**), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.[150][151] Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\n\n\n\n![Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries](image)Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) vs GDP per Capita in different countries\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a more promising focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\". Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.[152]\n\n\n\n## Forecasting[edit]\n\n\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\n\n\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\n\n\n\n1. Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using ARIMA or other time-series extrapolation procedures. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.\n2. Forecasting age-specific death rates and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods. This is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age-specific rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach in this group is the Lee-Carter model,[153] which uses the singular value decomposition on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series, and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. The software includes Professor Rob J. Hyndman's R package called 'demography' and UC Berkeley's LCFIT system.\n\n\n## Policy uses[edit]\n\n\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[154]\n\n\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).[155] There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = −0.620).[156]\n\n\n\n## Life expectancy vs. other measures of longevity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Remaining\" life expectancy—expected number of remaining years of life as a function of *current age*—is used in retirement income planning.[49]\nLife expectancy is commonly confused with the average age an adult could expect to live. This confusion may create the expectation that an adult would be unlikely to exceed an life expectancy, even though, with all statistical probability, an adult, who has already avoided many statistical causes of adolescent mortality, should be expected to outlive the life expectancy calculated from birth.[157] One must compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.[157]\n\n\n  \n\nLife expectancy can change dramatically after childhood. In the table above, note the life expectancy *at birth* in the Paleolithic is 22–33 years, but life expectancy at 15 is 54 years. Additional studies similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.[158][159]\n\n\nMaximum life span is an individual-specific concept, and therefore is an upper bound rather than an average.[157] Science author Christopher Wanjek writes, \"[H]as the human race increased its life span? Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.\" The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant.[157] Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).[157]\n\n\nHowever, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, \"[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.\"[160]\n\n\nLife expectancy can also create popular misconceptions about at what age a certain population may expect to die at. The modal age at death is the age when most deaths occur in a population, and is sometimes used instead of life expectancy for this kind of understanding. For example, in the table above, life expectancy in the Paleolithic is listed as 22–33 years. For many, this implies that most people in the Paleolithic died in their late twenties. However, in the Paleolithic, most adults in the Paleolithic died at *72 years* (the average modal adult life span).[161]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biodemography\n* Calorie restriction\n* Demography\n* Depreciation\n* DNA damage theory of aging\n* Glasgow effect\n* Health equity\n* Life extension\n* Life table\n* Lindy effect\n* List of countries by life expectancy\n* List of countries by past life expectancy\n* List of longest-living organisms\n* LGBT life expectancy\n* Maximum life span\n* Medieval demography\n* Mitohormesis\n* Mortality rate\n* Population pyramid\n* Senescence\n\n### Increasing life expectancy[edit]\n\n\n* Strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS)\n* John Sperling\n* Life extension\n* Longevity\n* Rejuvenation\n* Public health\n* Infant mortality\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In standard actuarial notation, *ex* refers to the expected future lifetime of *(x)* in whole years, while *eͦx* (with a ring above the *e*) denotes the complete expected future lifetime of *(x)*, including the fraction.\n2. **^** Japan's recorded life expectancy may have been very slightly increased by counting many infant deaths as stillborn.[58]\n3. **^**  Note the different units: a probability is unit-less, whereas a mortality rate has units (such as deaths per population per year).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\"Life Expectancy\" – What does this actually mean?\". *Our World in Data*.

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\nEstimation of the World Bank Group for 2021.[3][4][5] Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. The values in the World Bank Group tables are rounded. All calculations were done on raw data, therefore, due to the nuances of rounding, in some places illusory inconsistencies of indicators arose, with a size of 0.01 year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries

expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Countries &territories\n | 2019\n | 2021\n | 2019→2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | Male\n | Female\n | Gendergap |

The 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure,[4] Between 2011 and May 2016, Canada's population grew by 1.7 million people, with immigrants accounting for two-thirds of the increase.[5] Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth.[6] The main driver of population growth is immigration, and to a lesser extent, natural growth.[7][8]\n\n\nCanada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[9] driven mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent, family reunification.[10][11] In 2021, a total of 405,330 immigrants were admitted to Canada, mainly from Asia.[12][13] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[14] Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees,[15] accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density of Canadian provinces and territories >25 people/km2\n 15–24.9 people/km2\n 10–14.9 people/km2\n 5–9.9 people/km2\n 1–4.9 people/km2\n <1 people/km2\n\nMain article: Population of Canada\n\nThe 2021 Canadian census had a total population count of 36,991,981 individuals, making up approximately 0.5% of the world's total population.[4][18] A population estimate for 2023 put the total number of people in Canada at 40,097,761.[19][20]\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[21]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minutes\n* One death every 2 minutes\n* One net migrant every 2 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 1 minute\n\n\nDeath rate\n\n\n\n8.12 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)

province[edit]\n\n\nAll citizens of Canada are classified as \"Canadians\" as defined by Canada's nationality laws. \"Canadian\" as an ethnic group has since 1996 been added to census questionnaires for possible ancestral origin or descent. \"Canadian\" was included as an example on the English questionnaire and \"Canadien\" as an example on the French questionnaire.[44] \"The majority of respondents to this selection are from the eastern part of the country that was first settled. Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage.[45][46]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Province / Territory | Percent Canadians\n | Total Canadians\n |\n| --- | --- | ---

(assumed for 1981 to 2016) population as a percentage of the total population over time\n![](image)Visible minorities over time including projections\n![](image)Visible minorities as a population pyramid in total in 2016\nAccording to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" were self-reported by Canadians.[47] The major panethnic groups chosen were; European (52.5%), North American (22.9%), Asian (19.3%), North American Indigenous (6.1%), African (3.8%), Latin, Central and South American (2.5%), Caribbean (2.1%), Oceanian (0.3%), and Other (6%).[47][48] Statistics Canada reports that 35.5% of the population reported multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100%.[47][b]\n\n\nThe country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[c] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).[51]\n\n\nOf the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021 approximately 25.4 million reported being \"White\", representing 69.8 percent of the population.[52][2] The indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021.[53] One out of every four Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority,[2][d] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian (2.6 million people; 7.1 percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7 percent) and Black (1.5 million; 4.3 percent).[52]\n\n\nAs data is completely self-reported, and reporting individuals may have varying definitions of \"Ethnic origin\" (or may not know their ethnic origin), these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethno-cultural ancestries but rather how Canadians self-identify.\n\n\nData from this section from Statistics Canada, 2021.[55]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic origin[56] | %\n |

Canada number 8.3 million persons and make up approximately 23 percent of Canada's total population.[75] This represents the eighth-largest immigrant population in the world, while the proportion represents one of the highest ratios for industrialized Western countries.[91]\n\n\nSince confederation in 1867 through to the contemporary era, decadal and demi-decadal census reports have detailed immigration statistics. During this period, the highest annual immigration rate in Canada occurred in 1913, when 400,900 new immigrants accounted for 5.3 percent of the total population,[92][93] while the greatest number of foreign-born individuals admitted to Canada in single year occurred in 2021, with 405,330 new immigrants accounting for 1.1 percent of the total population.\n\n\nStatistics Canada projects that immigrants will represent between 29.1% and 34.0% of Canada's population in 2041, compared with 23.0% in 2021,[94] while the Canadian population with at least one foreign born parent (first and second generation persons) could rise to between 49.8% and 54.3%, up from 44.0% in 2021.[2][73][74]\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada Immigration Statistics[95][96]: 239[97]: 108[98]\n| Year\n | Immigrant percentage\n | Immigrant population\n | Total responses\n | Total population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1871\n | 16.1%\n | 594,207\n | —\n | 3,689,257\n |\n| 1881\n | 13.9%\n | 602,984\n | —\n | 4,324,810\n |\n| 1891\n | 13.3%\n | 643,871\n | —\n | 4,833,239\n |\n| 1901\n | 13%\n | 699,500\n | —\n | 5,371,315\n |\n| 1911\n | 22%\n | 1,586,961\n | —\n | 7,206,643\n |\n| 1921\n | 22.3%\n | 1,955,736\n | —\n | 8,787,949\n |\n| 1931\n | 22.2%\n | 2,307,525\n | —\n | 10,374,196\n |\n| 1941\n | 17.5%\n | 2,018,847\n | —\n | 11,506,655\n |\n| 1951\n | 14.7%\n | 2,059,911\n | —\n | 14,009,429\n |\n| 1961\n | 15.6%\n | 2,844,263\n | —\n | 18,238,247\n |\n| 1971\n | 15.3%\n | 3,295,535\n | 21,568,310\n | 21,568,311\n |\n| 1981\n | 16%\n | 3,843,335\n | 24,083,495\n | 24,343,181\n |\n| 1986\n | 15.6%\n | 3,908,150\n | 25,022,005\n | 25,309,331\n |\n| 1991\n | 16.1%\n | 4,342,890\n | 26,994,045\n | 27,296,859\n |\n| 1996\n | 17.4%\n | 4,971,070\n | 28,528,125\n | 28,846,761\n |\n| 2001\n | 18.4%\n | 5,448,480\n | 29,639,030\n | 30,007,094\n |\n| 2006\n | 19.8%\n | 6,186,950\n | 31,241,030\n | 31,612,897\n |\n| 2011\n | 20.6%\n | 6,775,765\n | 32,852,325\n | 33,476,688\n |\n| 2016\n | 21.9%\n | 7,540,830\n | 34,460,060\n | 35,151,728\n |\n| 2021\n | 23%\n | 8,361,505\n | 36,328,475\n | 36,991,981\n |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Canada\n\nReligion in Canada\n\n\n\nChristianity (53.3%)\nNo Religion (34.6%)\nIslam (4.9%)\nHinduism (2.3%)\nSikhism (2.1%)\nBuddhism (1.0%)\nJudaism (0.9%)\nOthers (0.8%)\n\nIn 2021, 53.3% of Canadians were Christians,[99] down from 67.3% in 2011.[100] 29.9% were Catholic while 11.4% were Protestant (all other listed denominations excluding Christian Orthodox, Latter Day Saints and Jehovah's Witnesses). 7.6% were Christian not otherwise specified, 2.1% were \"other Christian and Christian-related traditions\", 1.7% were Christian Orthodox, 0.4% were Jehovah's Witnesses and 0.2% were Latter Day Saints adherents.\n\n\n34.6% of Canadians were non-religious or secular, up from 23.9% in 2011.
