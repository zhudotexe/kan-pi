GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n\n\n\n\n## List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal) per capita 2021[edit]\n\n\n* The \"IMF\" column includes data for the year 2021 for members of the International Monetary Fund.[3]\n* The \"World Bank\" column includes data for the year 2019 from the World Bank.[4]\n\n\nData across columns are not comparable as they may refer to different years.

Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\n\nGDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (*see* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine, and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in *italics*.\n\n\nNote that several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Luxembourg.[3]\n\n\n*All data are in current United States dollars. Historical data can be found here.*\n\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\n*The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available estimates, and can be reranked by either of the

and Corporate haven § Distorted GDP/GNP\n\nMany of the leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax havens whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries.\n\n\nFor instance, the Irish GDP data above is subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created \"modified GNI\" (or GNI\\*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI\\*.\n\n\n\n\n> A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens. The eight major pass-through economies—the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore—host more than 85 percent of the world’s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons. \n> \n> — \"Piercing the Veil\", International Monetary Fund, June 2018[9]\n> \n\n\nFurther discussion on this topic can be found in the List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita article.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of IMF ranked countries by GDP, IMF ranked GDP (nominal), GDP (nominal) per capita, GDP (PPP), GDP (PPP) per capita, Population, and PPP\n* List of countries by average wage\n* List of countries by external debt\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The European Union is included because it is far more than a free trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or Mercosur.

Mexico and Caribbean nations of the Commonwealth of Nations are between the economic extremes of the development of North America.\n\n\nMexico lies in between these two extremes as a newly industrialized country (NIC), and is a part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), being one of the only two Latin American members of this organisation (together with Chile). The United States is by far the largest economy in North America and the largest national economy in the world.\n\n\nThe US, Canada and Mexico have significant and multifaceted economic systems.[11] In 2011, the US has an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $47,200, and is the most technologically developed economy in North America.[11] The United States' services sector comprises 80% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2017), industry comprises 19.1% and agriculture comprises 0.9%.[11]\n\n\nCanada's economic trends are similar to that of the United States, with significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing.[12] Canada's GDP (PPP) was estimated at $39,400 in 2010.[12] Canada's services sector comprises 70.2% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2017), industry comprises 28.2% and agriculture comprises 1.6%.[12]\n\n\nMexico has a GDP (PPP) of $15,312, and per capita income is estimated at one-third of the United States'.[13] The country has both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations,[13] and is modernizing in sectors such as energy production, telecommunications and airports.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic development[edit]\n\n\n### Great Depression[edit]\n\n\nThe Great Depression began in North America in October 1929. The start is often dated to the stock market collapse of Black Tuesday although this was not the cause of the Great Depression.[14] Canada and the United States experienced especially large declines, with the gross domestic product falling 37% from 1929 to 1933 in the United States, and 43% in Canada over the same period.[15] The economy reached its lowest point in 1933, however recovery was slow. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 created demand for war materials that brought about the end of the depression.\n\n\nThe Great Depression spurred increased government intervention in the economy in North America. The United States introduced unemployment insurance, a minimum wage and standardised working hours under the New Deal.[16] Canada introduced similar measures.[17] Mexico nationalised some key industries during the Great Depression, with the railroads nationalised by 1937 and the oil industry nationalised in 1938.[18]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nDue to the large scale enlistment of men into armed forces during World War II, women entered the workforce en masse, filling many jobs in manufacturing and technical areas that had previously been closed to women. This led to the \"We can do it!\" campaign.[19] The economic output in North America increased substantially, with unemployment practically eliminated in the United States.[20] Rationing severely reduced the availability of consumer goods, with the increase in industrial production coming from the demand for war materials. During the peak of World War II activity, nearly 40 per cent of US GDP was devoted to war production.[21]\n\n\n\n### Cold War[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2nd world war, the United States and Russia emerged as the world superpowers with both economies being strong and thus each country wanted to be recognised as a superpower.The relationship between the two countries further deteriorated with the space race.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(January 2011)*\n |\n\n\n### US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA - a new era of economic integration[edit]\n\n\nThe Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 and the subsequent expansion to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) triggered a dramatic increase in trade between these three countries, with Mexican trade with the United States and Canada increasing threefold.[22] Over 85% of Canadian exports in 2006 went to the United States.[23]\n\n\n\n## Regional variation[edit]\n\n\nWith various climate zones, agricultural products vary from country to country. Job sectors are also different, with industrialized countries having more service workers, and developing countries relying on agriculture.\n\n\n\n## Trade blocs[edit]\n\n\n### Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation[edit]\n\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a group of Pacific Rim countries which meet with the purpose of improving economic and political ties. APEC's stated goals are aimed at free and open trade and investments by cutting tariffs between zero and five percent in the Asia-Pacific area for industrialised economies by 2010 and for developing economies by 2020.\n\n\nThe organisation has members from four continents, those from North America are Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n\n\n\n### Caribbean Community[edit]\n\n\nThe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) was created *\"To provide dynamic leadership and service, in partnership with Community institutions and Groups, toward the attainment of a viable, internationally competitive and sustainable Community, with improved quality of life for all\"*. Its secretariat is based in Georgetown, Guyana, South America.\n\n\n- On January 1, 2006, six members: (Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago) unofficially ushered in the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy (CSME).\n\n\n- At the official signing of the protocol on January 30, 2006, in Jamaica, A further six members: (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) announced their intention to join by the second quarter of 2006. Montserrat, a British Oversees territory is awaiting approval by the United Kingdom. Haiti and the Bahamas have no immediate plans to join.\n\n\n\n### Central American Free Trade Agreement[edit]\n\n\nThe Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States and the Central American countries of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The treaty is aimed at promoting free trade between its members. Canada and Mexico are negotiating membership.\n\n\n\n### North American Free Trade Agreement[edit]\n\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is an agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States to eliminate tariffs on goods traded between themselves.\n\n\nAlthough currently only a trade agreement, with no supranational bodies or laws as in the European Union, there have been various proposals to move towards a customs union or a North American currency union. It is unknown whether this may eventually develop into a North American Union similar to that of Europe.\n\n\n\n## Currency[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a **list of the currencies of North America**, with exchange rates between each currency and both the *euro* and *US dollars* as of 20 July 2022.

In western Canada, in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, wheat and other various main agricultural products are grown. The U.S. also has many states with significant agriculture production, mainly in the central continental U.S. Mexico produces many tropical fruits and vegetables as well as edible animals.\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nNorth America has developed and its manufacturing sector has grown. In the beginning the European nations were the large manufacturing powers. At the start of the 1950s, the United States was a top manufacturing power, with Canada and Mexico also making significant progress.\n\n\n\n### Service[edit]\n\n\nIn Canada, the US and the Caribbean, service-based employment is a significant percentage of overall employment. Many people work in stores and other retail locations. In Canada more than 70% work in the services sector, with a similar percentage in the United States.\n\n\n\n### Investment and banking[edit]\n\n\nThe United States leads North America in investment and banking. Canada, Mexico and most recently, February 2011, El Salvador is growing in this sector. And smaller economic powers such as Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama are also growing slowly in this sector.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nTourism is extremely important for the Caribbean economies, as they contain many beaches and have warm climates. Skiing in Canada and the US is also important. Tourism of national parks and natural landmarks, such as Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon in the United States, and Niagara Falls and Moraine lake in Canada, contribute to the economy in these regions.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* North America\n* North American Industry Classification System\n\n\n**Statistics:**\n\n\n\n* List of North American countries by GDP (PPP)\n* List of North American countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of North American countries by GDP per capita\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"World Population Prospects 2022\".

It encompasses 6 percent of the world's population.\n\n\nFrom the 1930s to 1980s, countries of South America used Import Substitution, an economic policy that replaces foreign businesses as well as imports with domestic production. This was a policy made to increase domestic manufacturing. Furthermore, national spending on arms soared during periods of military rule. Increasingly South American countries began to borrow from foreign private banks and international lending institutions, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, to fund existing programs while also trying to expand their economic productivity through investments. However, this policy created a debt crisis in South America.[10]\n\n\nThe continent has fallen farther behind North America over the past two centuries. This can be explained by South America's high concentration on primary commodities as well as the state of the educational system and institutional structure, some of which are still related to its colonial past, others to recent political developments.[11]\n\n\nFrom the 1990s onward countries in South America switched over to the system of Free-Market economy. Now, major economic activities include agriculture, industry, forestry, and mining.\n\n\nIn 2016, four countries, which include Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina and Venezuela experienced decline in output. Other countries in the region were observing slowdown in growth rates.[12] Brazil saw this decline in output due to increasing unemployment level, worsening financial conditions and political issues, which, in turn, lead to decrease in private domestic consumption and investment.[12] Argentina also experienced recession in private consumption and investment, however it was because of removal of public service subsidies due to short-term rise in inflation. In contrast, Peru differed from other countries in the region - demonstrating increase in growth rates thanks to copper production.\n\n\nIn 2017, the economy has started to recover for the first time since 2014. The main contributors to economic growth is private consumption.[13] Increased retail trade and industrial production in Brazil has led to expansion of its economy by 1% in 2017. Higher public investments and private consumption have resulted in growth of economy of Argentina compared to its recession in 2016.\n\n\nIn 2017, inflation rates were observed to be in a downward trend in most of the major economies. The reasons are prior exchange rate appreciations and food price deflation. Some countries are even expected to lower their target bands in 2019.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic sectors[edit]\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sugarcane plantation in São Paulo. In 2018, Brazil was the world's largest producer, with 746 million tons. South America produces half of the world's sugarcane.\n![](image)Soy plantation in Mato Grosso. In 2020, Brazil was the world's largest producer, with 130 million tons. South America produces half of the world's soybeans.\n![](image)Coffee in Minas Gerais. In 2018, Brazil was the world's largest producer, with 3.5 million tons. South America produces half of the world's coffee.\n![](image)Orange in São Paulo. In 2018, Brazil was the world's largest producer, with 17 million tons. South America produces 25% of the world's oranges.\nThroughout history, since the colonial period, the export of natural resources has been a key factor for South America's economy. With a land that can be divided into four climatic regions (tropical, temperate, arid and cold), South America is a diverse land that is rich in natural resources. It has a wide variety of agricultural products, mineral wealth, plentiful freshwater and rich fisheries.\n\n\nAs one of the most important contributors of the world's agricultural market, South America accounts for approximately 10% of the global agricultural product export.[14] The different climatic regions are home for diverse types of crops. In the tropical climatic regions, two of the most important cash crops are coffee and cacao.[15] South America dominates the global market in coffee production, having Brazil as the world's largest exporter of coffee. A report from the Council of Brazilian Coffee Exporters showed that the coffee industry earned US$5.4 billion in 2016, with the exports of different coffee varieties exceeding 34 million 60 kg bags. This accounts to 6.4% of Brazil's total annual agrobusiness exports of US$84.9. The report showed that by December 2016, the Brazilian coffee industry generated US$557 million in revenue by exporting 3.07 million bags of coffee.[16] Additionally, in 2016 soybeans, grown in South America's temperate climates, had an export value of US$19B for Brazil , representing 10.4% of the total exports,[17] and one of US$3.23B for Argentina, representing 5.7% of the country's total exports.[18] Moreover, the soybean meal exportation represent 17.5% of Argentina's total exports, with an export value of $9.96B.[18]\n\n\nOther exports from the tropical regions, such as the Amazon rainforest (contained within Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia French Guiana and Suriname), include cashews and Brazil nuts, globally regarded as delicacies,[19] as well as sugar (sugarcane), avocados, bananas, pineapples, oranges, grapefruits, and mangoes. The sugarcane cultivation has been the backbone of the economy since early colonial times, and Ecuador is the world's largest banana exporter (Banana Production in Ecuador)\n\n\nIn the temperate regions, maize (corn) is produced and it is the second most exported product in Argentinas.[18] Additionally in cold climatic regions such as the Andes, there is a high production of crops such as quinoa, increasingly valued internationally, as well as the grazing of llamas, vicuñas and alpacas. These animals are bred for their wool and it is exported globally as a high-quality textile.[15]\n\n\nThe four countries with the strongest agriculture are Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia. Currently:\n\n\n\n* Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee, orange, guaraná, açaí and Brazil nut; is one of the top 5 producers of maize, papaya, tobacco, pineapple, banana, cotton, beans, coconut, watermelon, lemon and yerba mate; is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, avocado, tangerine, persimmon, mango, guava, rice, oat, sorghum and tomato; and is one of the top 15 world producers of grape, apple, melon, peanut, fig, peach, onion, palm oil and natural rubber;\n* Argentina is the world's largest producer of yerba mate; is one of the 5 largest producers in the world of soy, maize, sunflower seed, lemon and pear, one of the 10 largest producers in the world of barley, grape, artichoke, tobacco and cotton, and one of the 15 largest producers in the world of wheat, oat, chickpea, sugarcane, sorghum and grapefruit;\n* Chile is one of the 5 largest world producers of cherry and cranberry, and one of the 10 largest world producers of grape, apple, kiwi, peach, plum and hazelnut, focusing on exporting high-value fruits;\n* Colombia is one of the 5 largest producers in the world of coffee, avocado and palm oil, and one of the 10 largest producers in the world of sugarcane, banana, pineapple and cocoa;\n* Peru is the world's largest producer of quinoa; is one of the 5 largest producers of avocado, blueberry, artichoke and asparagus; one of the 10 largest producers in the world of coffee and cocoa; one of the 15 largest producers in the world of potato and pineapple, and also has a considerable production of grape, sugarcane, rice, banana, maize and cassava; its agriculture is considerably diversified;\n* Paraguay's agriculture is currently developing, being currently the 6th largest producer of soy in the world and entering the list of the 20 largest producers of maize and sugarcane.[20]\n\n\n### Animal husbandry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Truck of a meat company in Brazil. South America produces 20% of the world's beef and chicken meat.\nBrazil is the world's largest exporter of chicken meat: 3.77 million tons in 2019.[21][22] The country is the holder of the second largest herd of cattle in the world, 22.2% of the world herd. The country was the second-largest producer of beef in 2019, responsible for 15.4% of global production.[23] It was also the 3rd largest world producer of milk in 2018. This year, the country produced 35.1 billion liters.[24] In 2019, Brazil was the 4th largest pork producer in the world, with almost 4 million tons.[25]\n\n\nIn 2018, Argentina was the 4th largest producer of beef in the world, with a production of 3 million tons (behind only USA, Brazil and China). Uruguay is also a major meat producer. In 2018, it produced 589 thousand tons of beef.[26]\n\n\nIn chicken meat production, Argentina ranks among the 15 largest producers in the world, and Peru and Colombia are among the 20 biggest producers. In beef production, Colombia is one of the 20 largest producers in the world. In honey production, Argentina ranks among the 5 largest producers in the world, and Brazil among the 15 largest. In terms of production of cow's milk, Argentina ranks among the 20 largest producers in the world.[27]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)EMS, the largest Brazilian pharmaceutical industry\n![](image)Braskem, the largest Brazilian chemical industry\nThe World Bank annually lists the top manufacturing countries by total manufacturing value. According to the 2019 list, Brazil has the thirteenth most valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion), Venezuela the thirtieth largest (US$58.2 billion, however, it depends on oil to obtain this value), Argentina the 31st largest (US$57.7 billion), Colombia the 46th largest (US$35.4 billion), Peru the 50th largest (US$28.7 billion) and Chile the 51st largest (US$28.3 billion).[28]\n\n\n80% of the manufacturing of the Latin America region falls on Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.[29]\n\n\nBrazil has the third-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel, and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft (Embraer), food, pharmaceutical, footwear, metallurgy and consumer durables. In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world.[30][31][32] In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of pulp in the world and the 8th producer of paper.[33][34][35] In the footwear industry, in 2019, Brazil ranked 4th among world producers.[36][37][38][39] In 2019, the country was the 8th producer of vehicles and the 9th producer of steel in the world.[40][41][42] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the 8th in the world.[43][44][45] In textile industry, Brazil, although it was among the 5 largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated in world trade.[46] In the aviation sector, Brazil has Embraer, the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, behind Boeing and Airbus.\n\n\nIn 2019, Argentina was the 31st world producer of steel, the 28th producer of vehicles, the 22nd world producer of beer, the 4th world producer of soybean oil and the 3rd world producer of sunflower oil, among other industrial products.[47][48][49][50]\n\n\n\n### Mining[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iron mine in Minas Gerais. Brazil is the world's second largest iron ore exporter.\n![](image)Amethyst mine in Ametista do Sul. South America is a major producer of gems such as amethyst, topaz, emerald, aquamarine and tourmaline\nMining is one of the most important economic sectors in South America, especially for Chile, Peru and Bolivia, whose economies are highly dependent on this sector. The continent has large productions of gold (mainly in Peru, Brazil and Argentina);[51] silver (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina);[52] copper (mainly in Chile, Peru and Brazil);[53] iron ore (Brazil, Peru and Chile);[54] zinc (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[55] molybdenum (Chile and Peru);[56] lithium (Chile, Argentina and Brazil);[57] lead (Peru and Bolivia);[58] bauxite (Brazil);[59] tin (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[60] manganese (Brazil);[61] antimony (Bolivia and Ecuador);[62] nickel (Brazil);[63] niobium (Brazil);[64] rhenium (Chile);[65] iodine (Chile),[66] among others.\n\n\nBrazil stands out in the extraction of iron ore (where it is the 2nd largest producer and exporter in the world - iron ore is usually one of the 3 export products that generate the greatest value in the country's trade balance), copper, gold, bauxite (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), manganese (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), tin (one of the largest producers in the world), niobium (concentrates 98% of reserves known to the world) and nickel. In terms of gemstones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[67][68][69][70][71][72]\n\n\nChile contributes about a third of the world copper production.[73] In addition to copper, Chile was, in 2019, the world's largest producer of iodine[74] and rhenium,[75] the second largest producer of lithium[76] and molybdenum,[56] the sixth largest producer of silver,[77] the seventh largest producer of salt,[78] the eighth largest producer of potash,[79] the thirteenth producer of sulfur[80] and the thirteenth producer of iron ore[81] in the world.\n\n\nIn 2019, Peru was the 2nd largest world producer of copper[82] and silver,[77] 8th largest world producer of gold,[83] 3rd largest world producer of lead,[58] 2nd largest world producer of zinc,[84] 4th largest world producer of tin,[85] 5th largest world producer of boron[86] and 4th largest world producer of molybdenum.[56]\n\n\nIn 2019, Bolivia was the 8th largest world producer of silver;[77] 4th largest world producer of boron;[86] 5th largest world producer of antimony;[87] 5th largest world producer of tin;[85] 6th largest world producer of tungsten;[88] 7th largest producer of zinc,[89] and the 8th largest producer of lead.[58][90][91]\n\n\nIn 2019, Argentina was the 4th largest world producer of lithium,[76] the 9th largest world producer of silver,[77] the 17th largest world producer of gold[83] and the 7th largest world producer of boron.[86]\n\n\nColombia is the world's largest producer of emeralds.[92] In the production of gold, among 2006 and 2017, the country produced 15 tons per year until 2007, when its production increased significantly, breaking a record of 66.1 tons extracted in 2012. In 2017, it extracted 52.2 tons. The country is among the 25 largest gold producers in the world.[93] In the production of silver, in 2017 the country extracted 15,5 tons.[94][95][91]\n\n\n\n### Oil and gas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Copper mine in Chile. South America produces half of the world's copper.\nIn the production of oil, Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Venezuela was the 21st largest, with 877 thousand barrels / day, Colombia in 22nd with 886 thousand barrels / day, Ecuador in 28th with 531 thousand barrels / day and Argentina 29th with 507 thousand barrels / day. As Venezuela and Ecuador consume little oil and export most of their production, they are part of OPEC. Venezuela had a big drop in production after 2015 (where it produced 2.5 million barrels / day), falling in 2016 to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, due to lack of investments.[96]\n\n\nIn the production of natural gas, in 2018, Argentina produced 1524 bcf (billion cubic feet), Venezuela 946, Brazil 877, Bolivia 617, Peru 451, Colombia 379.[97]\n\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, Brazil exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[98]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Copacabana Palace, the best hotel in South America, in Rio de Janeiro\nIn the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Argentina was the 47th most visited country, with 6.9 million international tourists (and revenues of US$5.5 billion); Brazil was the 48th most visited with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of US$5.9 billion); Chile in position 53 with 5.7 million tourists (and revenues of US$2.9 billion); Peru in position 60 with 4.4 million tourists (and income of US$3.9 billion); Colombia 65th with 3.8 million tourists (and income of US$5.5 billion); Uruguay 69th with 3.4 million tourists (and income of US$2.3 billion). Please note that the number of tourists does not always reflect the monetary amount the country gets from tourism. Some countries carry out higher level tourism, obtaining more benefits. Tourism in South America is still little evolved: in Europe, for example, countries obtain annual tourist values such as U $73.7 billion (Spain), or U $67.3 billion (France). While Europe received 710 million tourists in 2018, Asia 347 million and North America 142.2 million, South America received only 37 million, Central America 10.8 million and the Caribbean 25.7 million.[99]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Grape plantation in Argentina.

There is also a considerable infrastructure of ports and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although it has potential, is usually treated in a secondary way.\n\n\nBrazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved, and about 14,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116.[100] Argentina has more than 600,000 km of roads, of which about 70,000 km are paved, and about 2,500 km are divided highways. The three most important highways in the country are Route 9, Route 7 and Route 14.[100] Colombia has about 210,000 km of roads, and about 2,300 km are divided highways.[101] Chile has about 82,000 km of roads, 20,000 km of which are paved, and about 2,000 km are divided highways. The most important highway in the country is the Route 5 (Pan-American Highway)[102] These 4 countries are the ones with the best road infrastructure and with the largest number of double-lane highways.\n\n\nDue to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and later to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined effort of countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).\n\n\nThere are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, is the largest and busiest in the country - the airport connects São Paulo to practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus, among others. Argentina has important international airports such as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Bariloche, Mendoza, Salta, Puerto Iguazú, Neuquén and Usuhaia, among others. Chile has important international airports such as Santiago, Antofagasta, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas and Iquique, among others. Colombia has important international airports such as Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena, Cali and Barranquilla, among others. Other important airports are those in the capitals of Uruguay (Montevideo), Paraguay (Asunción), Peru (Lima), Bolivia (La Paz) and Ecuador (Quito). The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and Minas Gerais (Brazil).[103]\n\n\nAbout ports, Brazil has some of the busiest ports in South America, such as Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí, Port of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. Argentina has ports such as Port of Buenos Aires and Port of Rosario. Chile has important ports in Valparaíso, Caldera, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica and Puerto Montt. Colombia has important ports such as Buenaventura, Cartagena Container Terminal and Puerto Bolivar. Peru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil), Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).[104]\n\n\nThe Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It's basically used for transporting ores.[105] The Argentine rail network, with 47,000 km of tracks, was one of the largest in the world and continues to be the most extensive in Latin America. It came to have about 100,000 km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. Chile has almost 7,000 km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has only about 3,500 km of railways.[106]\n\n\nAmong the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná (which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas Gerais) and Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km. Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon plain is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration. In Argentina, the waterway network is made up of the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. The main river ports are Zárate and Campana. The port of Buenos Aires is historically the first in individual importance, but the area known as Up-River, which stretches along 67 km of the Santa Fé portion of the Paraná River, brings together 17 ports that concentrate 50% of the total exports of the country.\n\n\n\n## Energy[edit]\n\n\n### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy policy of Brazil and Renewable energy in Brazil\n\n![](image)Itaipu Dam in Paraná.\n![](image)Wind power in Parnaíba.\n![](image)Angra Nuclear Power Plant in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro\nThe Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country's demand.[96] In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[98]\n\n\nBrazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country's energy generation.[107] In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).[108][109]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity. The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region's installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest. The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is located on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.[110][111]\n\n\nAs of July 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%.[112][113] While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%;[114][12] the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior.[115] In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country.[116] In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current demand.[117][118] In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW),[119][120] and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany.[121]\n\n\nNuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity.[122] The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.[123]\n\n\nAs of October 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%.[124] Some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (\"Minas Gerais\"), BA (\"Bahia\") and GO (Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records.[125][12][126] In 2019, solar power represented 1,27% of the energy generated in the country.[116] In 2021, Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13 GW),[127] and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).[128]\n\n\nIn 2020, Brazil was the 2nd largest country in the world in the production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nAfter Brazil, Colombia is the country in South America that most stands out in energy production. In 2020, the country was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, and in 2015 it was the 19th largest exporter. In natural gas, the country was, in 2015, the 40th largest producer in the world. Colombia's biggest highlight is in coal, where the country was, in 2018, the world's 12th largest producer and the 5th largest exporter. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 45th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (0.5 GW), 76th in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.1 GW) and 20th in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (12.6 GW). Venezuela, which was one of the world's largest oil producers (about 2.5 million barrels/day in 2015) and one of the largest exporters, due to its political problems, has had its production drastically reduced in recent years: in 2016, it dropped to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, reaching only 300,000 barrels/day at a given point. The country also stands out in hydroelectricity, where it was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed capacity in 2020 (16,5 GW). Argentina was, in 2017, the 18th largest producer in the world, and the largest producer in Latin America, of natural gas, in addition to being the 28th largest oil producer; although the country has the Vaca Muerta field, which holds close to 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, and is the second largest shale natural gas deposit in the world, the country lacks the capacity to exploit the deposit: it is necessary capital, technology and knowledge that can only come from offshore energy companies, who view Argentina and its erratic economic policies with considerable suspicion, not wanting to invest in the country. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 27th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (2.6 GW), 42nd in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.7 GW) and 21st in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW). The country has great future potential for the production of wind energy in the Patagonia region. Chile, although currently not a major energy producer, has great future potential for solar energy production in the Atacama Desert region. Paraguay stands out today in hydroelectric production thanks to the Itaipu Power Plant. Bolivia stands out in the production of natural gas, where it was the 31st largest in the world in 2015. Ecuador, because it consumes little energy, is part of OPEC and was the 27th largest oil producer in the world in 2020, being the 22nd largest exporter in 2014.[130][131][132][133][119]\n\n\n\n## Economy by country[edit]\n\n\n**Economy of:**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Argentina\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n | * Ecuador\n* French Guiana\n* Guyana\n* Paraguay\n | * Peru\n* Suriname\n* Uruguay\n* Venezuela\n |\n\n\n**Economic history of:**\n\n\n\n* Argentina\n* Brazil\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Ecuador\n* Peru\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Neugebauer Chocolate Factory in Arroio do Meio.

Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\n\nGDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (*see* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine, and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in *italics*.\n\n\nNote that several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Luxembourg.[3]\n\n\n*All data are in current United States dollars. Historical data can be found here.*\n\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\n*The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available estimates, and can be reranked by either of the

and Corporate haven § Distorted GDP/GNP\n\nMany of the leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax havens whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries.\n\n\nFor instance, the Irish GDP data above is subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created \"modified GNI\" (or GNI\\*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI\\*.\n\n\n\n\n> A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens. The eight major pass-through economies—the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore—host more than 85 percent of the world’s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons. \n> \n> — \"Piercing the Veil\", International Monetary Fund, June 2018[9]\n> \n\n\nFurther discussion on this topic can be found in the List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita article.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of IMF ranked countries by GDP, IMF ranked GDP (nominal), GDP (nominal) per capita, GDP (PPP), GDP (PPP) per capita, Population, and PPP\n* List of countries by average wage\n* List of countries by external debt\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The European Union is included because it is far more than a free trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or Mercosur.

This is similar to nominal GDP per capita, but adjusted for the cost of living in each country.\n\n\nIn 2019, the estimated average GDP per capita (PPP) of all of the countries of the world was Int$ 18,381.[a] For rankings regarding wealth, see list of countries by wealth per adult.\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) per capita figures on this page are derived from PPP calculations. Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.\n\n\nComparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of *nominal* GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (*see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita*); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.\n\n\nThis is why GDP (PPP) per capita is often considered one of the indicators of a country's standard of living,[3][4] although this can be problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income. (*See Standard of living and GDP*.)\n\n\nGDP (PPP) and GDP (PPP) per capita are usually measured by international dollar, which is a hypothetical currency that has the same purchasing power in every economy as the U.S. dollar in the United States.\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\nAll figures are in current international dollars, and rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n\n*The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available year's estimates, and can be reranked by either of the sources.*\n\n\n\\* *Nearly all country links in the table connect to articles titled \"Income in (*country *or* territory*)\" or to \"Economy of (*country *or* territory*)\".*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP per capita (current international dollar) by country or  territory or non IMF members \n|

However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data which produces artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures.[17] It is estimated that over 15% of global jurisdictions are tax havens (see tax haven lists).[18] An IMF investigation estimates that circa 40% of global foreign direct investment flows, which heavily influence the GDP of various jurisdictions, are described as \"phantom\" transactions.[19]\n\n\n\n\n> A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens. The eight major pass-through economies—the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore—host more than 85 percent of the world's investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons. \n> \n> — \"Piercing the Veil\", International Monetary Fund, June 2018[19]\n> \n\n\nIn 2017, Ireland's economic data became so distorted by U.S. multinational tax avoidance strategies (see leprechaun economics), also known as BEPS actions, that Ireland effectively abandoned GDP (and GNP) statistics as credible measures of its economy, and created a replacement statistic called modified gross national income (or GNI\\*). Ireland is one of the world's largest corporate tax havens.\n\n\n\n\n> Ireland has, more or less, stopped using GDP to measure its own economy. And on current trends [because Irish GDP is distorting EU-28 aggregate data], the eurozone taken as a whole may need to consider something similar.\n> \n> — Brad Setser, Council on Foreign Relations, \"Ireland exports its Leprechaun\", 25 April 2018[20]\n> \n\n\n\n> The statistical distortions created by the impact on the Irish National Accounts of the global assets and activities of a handful of large multinational corporations have now become so large as to make a mockery of conventional uses of Irish GDP.\n> \n> — Patrick Honohan, ex-Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, 13 July 2016[21]\n> \n\n\nA list of the top 15 GDP-per-capita countries from 2016 to 2017, contains most of the major global tax havens (see GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy for more detail):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **International Monetary Fund (2017)** | **World Bank (2016)**[22][23] |\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Country/Territory\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Qatar | Oil & Gas\n |\n| — | *![](image) Macau* | Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Luxembourg | Top 10 Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Singapore | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Brunei | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Ireland | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Norway | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Kuwait | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)  Switzerland | Top 10 Tax Haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| — | *![](image) Hong Kong* | Top 10 Tax Haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) San Marino | Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) United States | 59,495\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Netherlands | Top 10 Tax Haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Iceland | 52,150\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Bahrain | Oil & Gas\n |\n\n | \n\n| Rank\n | Country/Territory\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Qatar | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Luxembourg | Top 10 Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| — | *![](image) Macau* | Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Singapore | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Brunei | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Ireland | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 7 | ![](image)  Switzerland | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Norway | Oil & Gas\n |\n| — | *![](image) Hong Kong* | Top 10 Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) United States | 57,467\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Iceland | 51,399\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Netherlands | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Austria | 50,078\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Denmark | 49,496\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Sweden | 49,175\n |\n\n |  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP)\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of countries by past and projected GDP (PPP) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita growth rate\n* List of IMF ranked countries by GDP\n* Quality of life\n* Big Mac Index\n* Government spending\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There have been no exclusive estimates for world average by the IMF.

The paper implicitly adopts the \"smaller\" tax haven approach, i.e., disregarding larger countries which have either low taxes rates (for example, Russia), or systems of taxation which permit them to be used to structure tax avoidance schemes (for example, the United Kingdom). It also excludes non-sovereign tax havens (for example, Delaware or Labuan).\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Piercing the Veil, Finance & Development, June 2018, Vol. 55, No. 2\". IMF Finance & Development.
