The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\n\n\nFounded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title *real* is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 83,186-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (*socios*) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[6] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023[7][8] and was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football club.[9] In 2023, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €713.8 million.[10]\n\n\nBeing one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably *El Clásico* with Barcelona and *El Derbi Madrileño* with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.[11][12] Real Madrid is known for its *Galácticos* policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[13] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000-2006 and 2009-2018), however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the *Galácticos* legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also suffered under the policy.[14] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record breaking £80 million (€94 million);[15] he became both the club and history's all-time top goalscorer.[16][17][18][19] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham.[20]\n\n\nIn domestic football, the club has won 69 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[21] In European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies;[note 1] a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a record[note 2] five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record eight club world championships.[note 3] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[27] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[28][29]\n\n\nReal Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[30] whilst also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[31] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42),[32] tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[33] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (*three-peat*) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In May 2022, they won a record-extending fourteenth Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognized as such by the Guinness World Records.[34] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[35] As of March 2023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last ten-years (2013–2023) overall.[36][37]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Real Madrid CF\n\nSee also: List of Real Madrid CF seasons\n\n### Early years (1902–1943)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Julián Palacios, the first president of the club in 1900–1902\nReal Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the *Institución Libre de Enseñanza*, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded *(Sociedad) Sky Football* in 1897, commonly known as *La Sociedad* (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, *Nueva Sociedad de Football* (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from *Sky Football*. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, *Sky* was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[38][39][40] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[4] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of *Al Capricho*, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honor of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Madrid FC team in 1906\nThree years after its founding, in 1905, *Madrid FC* won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the *Campo de O'Donnell* in 1912.[43] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[44]\n\n\nIn 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[45] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[46]\n\n\nOn 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honor of General Franco.[note 4][47] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[48] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper *Ya* reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[49] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Lluis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: *Reds! Separatists!*... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[50]\n\n\nReal Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[51] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[52] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[48] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[53]\n\n\n\n### Santiago Bernabéu and unprecedented success (1943–1978)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alfredo Di Stéfano led the club to win five consecutive European Cups (currently the Champions League).\nSantiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[54] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former *Real Madrid Amateurs* player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"*cantera*,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Amancio Amaro, captain of the Yé-yé team of the 1960s\nIn 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of *L'Équipe*, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[56] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[55] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honor.[57] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[58]\n\n\nThe club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[59] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for *Marca* and impersonated the Beatles.[60] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[61] and 1964.[59] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[62] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[63] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honor him during the tournament.[64] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president.\n\n\nBernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[65]\n\n\n\n\n### Quinta del Buitre and sustained success (1980–2000)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Casillas**\n**Helguera**\n**Karanka**\n**Campo**\n**Salgado**\n**Roberto Carlos**\n**McManaman**\n**Redondo (C)**\n**Anelka**\n**Raúl**\n**Morientes**\n2000 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[66][67] Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name *La Quinta del Buitre* (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[66][67] With *La Quinta del Buitre* (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán *Chendo* and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[66][67] In the early 1990s, *La Quinta del Buitre* split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.\n\n\nIn 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[68] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[69]\n\n\nIn November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[70] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[71]\n\n\n\n### Florentino Pérez era (2000–2006)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Galácticos\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**César**\n**Hierro (c)**\n**Helguera**\n**Salgado**\n**Roberto Carlos**\n**Makélélé**\n**Figo**\n**Solari**\n**Zidane**\n**Raúl**\n**Morientes**\n2002 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[72] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[73] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the *Galácticos* team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[74] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the *Zidanes y Pavones* policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Beckham and Zidane were considered *Galácticos*.\nThe few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[76] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[77] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[78] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[78]\n\n\nThe 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[79] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[80] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[81] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[82] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[83]\n\n\n\n### Ramón Calderón era (2006–2009)[edit]\n\n\nRamón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[84] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[85] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[86]\n\n\n\n### Second Florentino Pérez era (2009–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cristiano Ronaldo was the club's most expensive signing when he joined in 2009, costing €94 million.\n![](image)Match between Deportivo de La Coruña and Real Madrid in the 2015–16 season.\nOn 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[87][88] Pérez continued with the *Galácticos* policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[89] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[90] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the *Second Galácticos*.[91] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[92] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[93][94]\n\n\nJosé Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[95][96] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four *Clásicos* were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second *Galáctico* era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[97][98] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[99] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe.\n\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[100] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[101] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[102][103]\n\n\nReal Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the *Blaugrana* six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[104] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[105]\n\n\n\n#### *La Décima* and Champions League dominance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Casillas (C)**\n**Ramos**\n**Varane**\n**Carvajal**\n**Coentrão**\n**Khedira**\n**Modrić**\n**Di María**\n**Bale**\n**Ronaldo**\n**Benzema**\n2014 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup, with a front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo (dubbed BBC)\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrate the club's historic tenth European Cup / Champions League win (*La Décima*) in 2014.\nOn 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[106] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[107] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[108] By that time, *Los Blancos* had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[109] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[110] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"*La Décima*\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[111] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[112]\n\n\nAfter winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[113] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[114] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[115]\n\n\nAfter a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[116] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[117] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[118] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[119] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011–12.[120] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[121] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[122][123]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[124] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first *Clásico* of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[125][126][127] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[128] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[129] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favor, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[130] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"*La Undécima*\".[131][132][133]\n\n\n\n![](image)2016–17 La Liga champions Real Madrid celebrate the title with Community of Madrid President Cristina Cifuentes.\nReal Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[134] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[135] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[136] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[137] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[138] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[139] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[140][141] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"*La Duodécima*\".[142] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[143]\n\n\nReal kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[144] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in *El Clásico* matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[145] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[146] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[147][148] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the *Second Galáctico Era* that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the *Blaugrana* boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[149] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[150] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Following Ronaldo's departure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of Real Madrid's league performance 1929–2023\nOn 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[151][152] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[153] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in *El Clásico* on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[154] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[155] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[156] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[157]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[158] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[159] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[160] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[161][162]\n\n\n\n#### Further domestic success and *La Decimocuarta*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrating the double on 29 May 2022, the day after their Champions League victory\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Courtois**\n**Militão**\n**Alaba**\n**Carvajal**\n**Mendy**\n**Casemiro**\n**Modrić**\n**Kroos**\n**Valverde**\n**Vinícius Jr.**\n**Benzema (C)**\n2022 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nZidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[163] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[164] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[165][166][167] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[168] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[169] defeating pre-tournament favorites Paris Saint-Germain,[170][171] defending champions and favorites Chelsea,[172] Premier League champions and heavy favorites Manchester City,[173] all in dramatic fashion,[174] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favorites,[175] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius goal sealed the 14th European Cup for *Los Blancos*, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[176][177] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favored to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[178]\n\n\n\n## Crests and colours[edit]\n\n\n### Crests[edit]\n\n\n* ![1902](image)\n\n1902\n* ![1908](image)\n\n1908\n* ![1920](image)\n\n1920\n* ![1931](image)\n\n1931\n* ![1941](image)\n\n1941\n* ![2001](image)\n\n2001\n\n\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.\nThe first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[179] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[180] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself *Real Madrid Club de Fútbol*.[179]\n\n\nWith the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[46] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[181][54] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name *Real Madrid Club de Fútbol*.[179] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[179]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (1902–2000).\n ![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (2000–present).\n\n![](image)Real Madrid in 1964. Nicknamed *Los Blancos* (The Whites), the club has worn an all-white home kit except for one season in 1925.\nReal Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honor of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[182] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 5] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[54] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[183]\n\n\nReal's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[184][185] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[186][187] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[188] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[189][190] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[191] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[192] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid's jersey (worn by Luka Modrić in 2015) is manufactured by Adidas, with Emirates the shirt sponsor.\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt sponsor\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1982\n | Adidas | —\n |\n| 1982–1985\n | Zanussi |\n| 1985–1989\n | Hummel | Parmalat |\n| 1989–1991\n | Reny Picot\n |\n| 1991–1992\n | Otaysa\n |\n| 1992–1994\n | Teka |\n| 1994–1998\n | Kelme |\n| 1998–2001\n | Adidas\n |\n| 2001–2002\n | Realmadrid.com[note 6] |\n| 2002–2005\n | Siemens mobile |\n| 2005–2006\n | Siemens |\n| 2006–2007\n | BenQ-Siemens |\n| 2007–2013\n | bwin |\n| 2013–0000 | Emirates |\n\n\n#### Kit deal[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier | Period | Contractannouncement | Contractduration | Value | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adidas\n | 1998–present\n |\n| Undisclosed\n | 2015–2020 (6 years)\n | Total €1 billion[194] |  |\n| 8 May 2019\n | 2020–2028 (8 years)[195] | Total €1.1 billion[196] |  |\n\n\n*Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.*\n\n\n\n## Grounds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Estadio Chamartín, Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium\n\n\n\nSantiago Bernabéu| ![](image) |\n| Capacity | 81,044 |\n| Field size | 107 m × 72 m (351 ft × 236 ft)[197] |\n| Construction |\n| Broke ground | 27 October 1944 |\n| Opened | 14 December 1947 |\n| Architect | Manuel Muñoz Monasterio, Luis Alemany Soler, Antonio Lamela |\n\n\nAfter moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[43] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[198] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[45] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[54][199] Initially knows as *Nuevo Chamartín*, the stadium was renamed in honor of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[55] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with *Los Blancos* winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[54]\n\n\nThe capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[200] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[200] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[201][202][203][204]\n\n\nThe Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[205] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[206] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[207]\n\n\nOn 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[208] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[209][210]\n\n\nThe latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to just over the 85,000 mark.[211][212] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[213][214] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[215][216]\n\n\n\n## Records and statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics\n\nSee also: Real Madrid CF in international football\n\n![](image)Raúl is Real Madrid's all-time leader in appearances.\nRaúl holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741 first-team matches from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710 times.[217] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 200 caps, Cristiano Ronaldo is Real's most capped international player. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's record goalscorer and the first player ever to score against every team in a single La Liga season.\nCristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[218][219] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[220]\n\n\nOfficially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a Copa del Rey match in 2006. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 81,044.[221] The club's average attendance in the 2007–08 season was 76,234, the highest in European leagues.[222] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (35 as of 2021–22) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gareth Bale is the club's joint record signing, costing €100 million in 2013.\nThe club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fourteen times[224] and for the most semi-finals appearances (32). As of June 2023, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[225] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide.[226] The same season, the team tied the record winning streak in the Champions League, with ten games.[227] In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game.[228]\n\n\nIn June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[229][230] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[107] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[231] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[232] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[233]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The number of season tickets at the Bernabéu is capped at 65,000, with the remaining seats made available to the general public.\nDuring most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[234] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a *socio*, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 *peñas* (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[235][236]\n\n\nReal Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called *Ultras Sur* supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio *Irriducibili* fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[237][238] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[239][240] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[241]\n\n\nQuestioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[242] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[243]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### El Clásico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Clásico\n\n![](image)Scene from a 2011 *El Clásico* at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (*El Clásico*). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[244] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[245]\n\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid fans displaying the white of their club before *El Clásico*. Real Madrid fans also often wave Spanish flags at *El Clásico* games.[246]\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[247][248] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto *Més que un club* (*English: More than a club*) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[249]\n\n\nThere is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[250] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[251][181]\n\n\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to *Los Blancos*, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[252]\n\n\nDi Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[253] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[254] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[255] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[256] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[257] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[257][258] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[257] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[257] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[257] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[259]\n\n\n\n### El Derbi madrileño[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Madrid derby\n\n![](image)Real Madrid supporters during the 2006 *El Derbi madrileño* match held at the Santiago Bernabéu\nThe club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[45] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[181] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were *\"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\"* – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[260][261]\n\n\nThe rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[262] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[263] It is worth noting that by then, Real Madrid was not very keen on signing non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, *\"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\"* (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[264] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[265][266] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region).\n\n\nBetween 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable.[267] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[268] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[269] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[270]\n\n\n\n### El Viejo Clásico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Viejo Clásico\n\n![](image)Real Madrid's Guti (left) and Athletic Bilbao's Javi Martínez (centre) and Amorebieta (right) during a match at the Bernabéu, 2010\nA further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (*the old classic*),[271] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[272][273] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by *El Clásico*.[274]\n\n\nAthletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[275] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the *Lions* have collected no major trophies since 1984 and won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[271][276][277] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[278][261][279]\n\n\n\n### European rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Real Madrid CF in international football § European Cup / UEFA Champions League\n\n#### Bayern Munich[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bayern Munich–Real Madrid rivalry\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrating a goal against Bayern Munich in 2007\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning fourteen times and Bayern winning six times.[280][281] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[282] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[283][284][285] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium), and then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate on their way to winning the competition.[286] They were also drawn together in the 2016–17 quarter-finals; Real Madrid won 6–3 on aggregate after extra time and subsequently lifted the trophy.[282] The following year, they met in the semi-finals, with Real Madrid again progressing 4–3.[287] Until the 2018–19 season, when they were twice defeated in Madrid by three-goal margins,[288][289] Real's biggest loss at home in the Champions League had been at the hands of Bayern on 29 February 2000, 2–4.[290]\n\n\n\n#### Juventus[edit]\n\n\nAnother match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[291][292][293]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pre-match display at the 2017 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Juventus\nTheir first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[292] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[292] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[292][294] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[292] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the *Bianconeri* in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[295]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[292] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[292][296][297]\n\n\nThe latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[298][299] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[300] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[301] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[302]\n\n\n\n## Finances and ownership[edit]\n\n\nIt was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[303] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[75] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[304]\n\n\nThe sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[305] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[78]\n\n\nBy September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[306] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[307] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[308] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[309]\n\n\nA study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[310] In 2010, *Forbes* evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[311][312] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[313]\n\n\nAlong with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[314] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[315] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[316] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 *socios*.[317] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[318][319]\n\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[318] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[318] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[320] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, *Forbes* listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[321] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[10] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[322][323] In 2022, *Forbes* listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[9]\n\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the *Goal!* football movie trilogy, *Goal! 2: Living the Dream...* (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324]\n\n\n*Real, The Movie* is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on *galácticos* such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase.\n\n\nThe book *White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid* by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled *Legends*, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325]\n\n\n\n### Real Madrid TV[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre.\n\n\n\n### *Hala Madrid*[edit]\n\n\n\"Hala Madrid\" redirects here. For the club's anthem, see Hala Madrid y nada más.\n\n*Hala Madrid* is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the *Madridistas Fan Club* card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[327] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times.\n\n\nIn 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being *Real Madrid: The Game*, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay.\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nFor a comprehensive listing of Real Madrid honours, see List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics § Honours.\n\n\n\nReal Madrid CF honours\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | La Liga[22] | **35** | 1931–32, 1932–33, 1953–54, 1954–55, 1956–57, 1957–58, 1960–61, 1961–62, 1962–63, 1963–64, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1971–72, 1974–75, 1975–76, 1977–78, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1985–86, 1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90, 1994–95, 1996–97, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2011–12, 2016–17, 2019–20, 2021–22 |\n| Copa del Rey[22][328] | **20** | 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1917, 1934, 1936, 1946, 1947, 1961–62, 1969–70, 1973–74, 1974–75, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1988–89, 1992–93, 2010–11, 2013–14, 2022–23 |\n| Copa de la Liga[22] | **1** | 1985 |\n| Supercopa de España[22][329] | **12** | 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2019–20, 2021–22 |\n| Copa Eva Duarte | **1** | 1947 |\n| **Continental** | European Cup/UEFA Champions League[22] | **14** | 1955–56, 1956–57, 1957–58, 1958–59, 1959–60, 1965–66, 1997–98, 1999–2000, 2001–02, 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2021–22 |\n| UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League[22][330] | **2** | 1984–85, 1985–86 |\n| UEFA Super Cup[22] | **5**s | 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2022 |\n| Latin Cup[22][23] | **2**s | 1955, 1957 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup[22] | **5** | 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| Intercontinental Cup[22][331] | **3**s | 1960, 1998, 2002 |\n| Ibero-American Cup[25][26] | **1** | 1994 |\n| **Regional** | Campeonato de Madrid/Campeonato Regional Centro[22] | **23** | 1903, 1904–05, 1905–06, 1906–07, 1907–08, 1912–13, 1915–16, 1916–17, 1917–18, 1919–20, 1921–22, 1922–23, 1923–24, 1925–26, 1926–27, 1928–29, 1929–30, 1930–31, 1931–32, 1932–33, 1933–34, 1934–35, 1935–36\n |\n| Copa Federación Centro | **4** | 1923, 1928, 1943, 1945\n |\n\n\n* record\n* s shared record\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Real Madrid CF players\n\nFor a list of all former and current Real Madrid CF players with a Wikipedia article, see Category:Real Madrid CF players.\n\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship.

Founded in 1899, the club competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian football, and has spent its entire history there with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.[7][8]\n\n\nDomestically, AC Milan has won 19 league titles, making it the second most successful club in the Serie A together with city rivals Inter Milan.[9] The club has also won 5 Coppa Italia titles and 7 Supercoppa Italiana titles.[10] In international competitions, Milan's 18 FIFA and UEFA trophies is the fourth highest out of any club in the world (joint with Boca Juniors and Independiente),[nb 1] and the most out of any Italian club.[10][11][12][13] Milan has won seven European Cup/Champions League titles, a joint record[nb 2] five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record[nb 3] three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.[10]\n\n\nIn its early history, Milan played its home games in different grounds around the city before moving to its current stadium, the San Siro, in 1926. The stadium, which was built by Milan's second chairman Piero Pirelli and has been shared with Inter Milan since 1947,[14] is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 75,817.[15] They have a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, one of the most followed derbies in football.[16]\n\n\nThe club is one of the wealthiest in Italian and world football.[17] It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of AC Milan\n\n### Foundation and early years (1899–1950)[edit]\n\n\n![A black-and-white picture of Herbert Kilpin, the first captain of AC Milan](image)Herbert Kilpin, the club's first captain and one of its founding members\n![](image)The AC Milan formation that won the Italian championship in 1901\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \"*Saremo una squadra di diavoli. I nostri colori saranno il rosso come il fuoco e il nero come la paura che incuteremo agli avversari.*\"— 1899, Herbert Kilpin[19][20]\n | \"*We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black like the fear we will invoke in our opponents.*\"— 1899, Herbert Kilpin\n |\n\n\nAC Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriate Herbert Kilpin.[8] The club claims 16 December of that year as their foundation date,[21] but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days earlier, most likely on 13 December.[2] However, with the club's charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate.\n\n\nIn honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901, interrupting a three-year hegemony of Genoa, and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907.[7] The club proved successful in the first decade of its existence, with several important trophies won, including, among others, the *Medaglia del Re* three times,[22] the *Palla Dapples* 23 times[23] and the *FGNI tournament* five times, a competition organized by the Italian Gymnastics Federation but not officially recognized by the Italian Football Federation.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)AC Milan celebrating after winning the European Cup Winners' Cup final in 1968\nIn 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale.[25] Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950–51,[10] with some exceptions represented by the 1915–16 *Coppa Federale*[26] and the 1917–18 *Coppa Mauro*,[27] two tournaments played during the First World War which, especially the former, received a lot of attention and proved to be highly competitive, despite them not being officially recognized by the Italian federation.\n\n\n\n### Return to victory and international affirmation (1950–1970)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959.[10] This decade witnessed also the first European successes of Milan, with the triumphs in the 1951 and 1956 Latin Cup. Milan was also the first Italian club to take part to the newly born European Cup in the 1955–56 season, and reached the final two years later, when they were defeated by Real Madrid.\n\n\nThe 1960s began with the debut of Milan's legend Gianni Rivera in 1960:[28] he would remain with the club for the rest of his career for the following 19 seasons. In 1961, Nereo Rocco was appointed as new coach of the club,[29] which under his leadership won immediately a *scudetto* in 1961–62, followed, in the next season, by Milan's first European Cup triumph, achieved after beating Benfica in the final.[30][31] This success was repeated in 1969, with a 4–1 win over Ajax in the final, which was followed by the Intercontinental Cup title the same year.[10] During this period Milan also won its first Coppa Italia, with victory over Padova in the 1967 final, and two European Cup Winners' Cups: in 1967–68 and 1972–73.[10]\n\n\n\n### 10th *Scudetto* and decline (1970–1986)[edit]\n\n\nDomestically, the 1970s were characterized by the pursuit of the 10th Serie A title, which grants the winner the *Scudetto* star. For three years in a row, in 1971, 1972 and 1973, Milan ended up second in the league, after some memorable duels with Inter and Juventus. Finally, the achievement was reached in 1979. The same year saw the retirement of Gianni Rivera and the debut of Franco Baresi, at his first full season with the club. After this success, the team went into a period of decline. The club in 1980 was involved in the Totonero scandal and as punishment was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history.[32] The scandal was centred around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches.[32] Milan achieved promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt, winning the 1980–81 Serie B title,[10] but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its 1981–82 campaign in third-last place. In 1983, Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A,[10] where they achieved a sixth-place finish in 1983–84.\n\n\n\n### Berlusconi's ownership and international glory (1986–2012)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mauro Tassotti (left) holds the UEFA Champions League trophy along with manager Fabio Capello, following Milan's victory in the 1993–94 edition of the tournament.\nOn 20 February 1986, entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi (who owned Fininvest and Mediaset) acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy after investing vast amounts of money,[7] appointing rising manager Arrigo Sacchi at the helm of the *Rossoneri* and signing Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard.[7] The Dutch trio added an attacking impetus to the team, and complemented the club's Italian internationals Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Roberto Donadoni. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the 1987–88 season. The following year, the club won its first European Cup in two decades, beating Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final. Milan retained their title with a 1–0 win over Benfica a year later and was the last team to win back-to-back European Cups until Real Madrid's win in 2017.[33] The Milan team of 1988–1990, nicknamed the \"Immortals\" in the Italian media,[34] has been voted the best club side of all time in a global poll of experts conducted by *World Soccer* magazine.[35]\n\n\nAfter Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club's former player Fabio Capello whose team won three consecutive Serie A titles between 1992 and 1994, a spell which included a 58-match unbeaten run in Serie A (which earned the team the label \"the Invincibles\"),[34][36][37] and back-to-back UEFA Champions League final appearances in 1993, 1994 and 1995. A year after losing 1–0 to Marseille in the 1993 Champions League final, Capello's team reached its peak in one of Milan's most memorable matches of all time, the famous 4–0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final.[36] Capello's side went on to win the 1995–96 league title before he left to manage Real Madrid in 1996.[36] In 1998–99, after a two-year period of decline, Milan lifted its 16th championship in the club's centenary season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Milan captain Paolo Maldini lifting the European Cup after they won the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League\n![](image)Milan celebrates winning the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League.\nMilan's next period of success came under another former player, Carlo Ancelotti. After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club's sixth European Cup.[38] The team then won the Scudetto in 2003–04 before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties despite leading 3–0 at half-time.[38] Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final, with Milan winning 2–1 to lift the title for a seventh time.[38][39] The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007.[40] In 2009, after becoming Milan's second longest serving manager with 420 matches overseen,[40] Ancelotti left the club to take over as manager at Chelsea.\n\n\nDuring this period, the club was involved in the *Calciopoli* scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favourable referees.[41] A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers;[42] the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was banned from the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points,[43] which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation.\n\n\nFollowing the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club's mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010–11 Serie A season, their first since the 2003–04 season and 18th overall.[44][45]\n\n\n\n### Changes in ownership and decline (2012–2019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jerseys of Paolo Maldini (number 3), Kaká (number 22) and Zlatan Ibrahimović (number 11) in the San Siro museum\nAfter their 18th Scudetto, the club declined in performance. Milan failed to qualify to European competitions for a few years, and the only trophy won was the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana, achieved under Vincenzo Montella's coaching after defeating Juventus in the penalty shoot-out.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 5 August 2016, a new preliminary agreement was signed with the Chinese investment management company Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co., to which Fininvest sold a 99.93% stake of Milan for about €520 million, plus the refurbishment of the club financial debt of €220 million.[46] On 13 April 2017, the deal was completed and Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux became the new direct parent company of the club.[47] In order to finalise the deal, American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation provided Li with a loan of €303 million (€180 million to complete the payment to Fininvest and €123 million issued directly to the club).[48][49] On 10 July 2018, Li failed to keep up with his loan repayment plan, neglecting to deposit a €32 million instalment on time in order to refinance the €303 million loan debt owed to the American hedge fund. As a result, In July 2018, chairman Li Yonghong's investment vehicle Rossoneri Champion Inv. Lux. was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux., the direct parent company of the club, making the investment vehicle majority controlled by Elliott Management Corporation the sole shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux.[50][51][52][53]\n\n\nOn 27 November 2017, Montella was sacked due to poor results and replaced by former player Gennaro Gattuso.[54] Milan qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage after finishing 6th in the 2017–18 Serie A season, but were banned by UEFA from European competition due to violations of Financial Fair Play regulations for failure to break-even.[55] Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the decision was overturned on 20 July 2018.[56][57][58]\n\n\nIn Gattuso's first full season in charge, Milan exceeded expectations and spent much of the campaign in the top 4. Despite winning their final 4 games, Milan missed out on the Champions League by one point.[59] After Milan's failure to qualify for the Champions League, Gattuso resigned as manager.[60] On 19 June 2019, Milan hired former Sampdoria manager Marco Giampaolo on a 2-year contract. On 28 June 2019, Milan was excluded from the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League for violating Financial Fair Play regulations for the years 2014–2017 and 2015–2018.[61]\n\n\n\n### Recent history (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Rossoneri* fans celebrating their 2021–22 Serie A win in Piazza del Duomo, Milan\nAfter four months in charge, Giampaolo was sacked after losing four of his first seven games, which was exacerbated by poor performances and a lack of supporter confidence. Stefano Pioli was hired as his replacement.[62] After the restart of the Serie A campaign due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Milan went on a 10 match unbeaten streak, winning 7 in the process including matches against Juventus, Lazio and Roma. This streak led to Milan abandoning their plans of hiring Ralf Rangnick as their new manager and sporting director, and instead extended Pioli's contract for a further 2 years.[63] Following a stellar start in the 2020–21 Serie A, which was a continuation of the second half of the previous season, Milan under Pioli in his first full season were led to a second-place finish in the league which was the highest finish for the team since the 2011–12 Serie A. This result allowed Milan to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League for the following season, which would become their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League in seven years since their last appearance in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League.\n\n\nMilan secured their 19th Italian championship title on the last round of the 2021–22 season, with a club-record tally of 86 points. It was their first league title since the 2010–11 season. In the Serie A Awards, Rafael Leão was named as the league's most valuable player, Mike Maignan as the best goalkeeper, and Pioli as coach of the season.[64][65][66] On 1 June 2022, RedBird Capital Partners agreed to acquire AC Milan at $1.3 billion, meanwhile Elliott Management Corporation would keep a minority stake.[67]\n\n\n\n## Colours and badge[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to AC Milan kits.\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the city of Milan – has been the club badge worn on match kits from the origins to the mid 1940s\nRed and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen by its founder Herbert Kilpin to represent the players' fiery ardor (red) and the opponents' fear to challenge the team (black). *Rossoneri*, the team's widely used nickname, literally means \"the red & blacks\" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.[68]\n\n\nAnother nickname derived from the club's colours is *the Devil*. An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a *Golden Star for Sport Excellence* located next to it.[69] As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. The official Milan logos have always displayed the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose,[69] next to red and black stripes. The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the *Comune di Milano*, with the acronym *ACM* at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.[69] For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid 1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil's logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995–96, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days.\n\n\nSince its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri's first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985-86 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. Between the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons, the AC Milan shirt achieved an important record by adding the surnames of the players above the number for the first time in Italian football.[70]\n\n\nFrom the 1986–87 season, under the impulse of the new club owner Silvio Berlusconi, the stripes were brought back to a middle size, and the colour of the socks was changed to white, taking the same colour of the shorts. In such a way, Berlusconi aimed at giving the players a more elegant look, as well as making the kit more distinguishably *red and black* when watched on the television compared to the thin striped kit, which, at a distance and on the television, could mistaken for a full red or brown shirt.[71] This style continued until 1998. Starting from the 1998–99 season, the kits started to be modified on a yearly basis in their design.\n\n\nMilan's away kit has always been completely white, sometimes adorned with various types of decorations, the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe.[72] The white away kit is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"I can't think of many shirts out there that are as recognisable as Milan's. – Our kits go beyond just the sphere of football.\"— In an interview with SoccerBible, Milan player Gianluca Lapadula complimented the iconic design of *Rossoneri*.[73]\n |\n\n\n* ![First logo of the \"Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club\", used from 1899 to 1916](image)\n\nFirst logo of the \"Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club\", used from 1899 to 1916\n* ![Milan logo used between 1936 and 1945](image)\n\nMilan logo used between 1936 and 1945\n* ![Milan logo used between 1946 and 1979, with few variations over the years](image)\n\nMilan logo used between 1946 and 1979, with few variations over the years\n* ![Milan logo used between 1986 and 1998](image)\n\nMilan logo used between 1986 and 1998\n* ![Milan logo used since 1998](image)\n\nMilan logo used since 1998\n\n### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt sponsor\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Brand\n | Company\n | Back\n | Sleeve\n |\n| 1978–80\n | Adidas |  |  | None\n |\n| 1980–82\n | Linea Milan\n | Pooh Jeans\n | Italiana Manifatture\nNone\n |\n| 1982–83\n | NR\n | Hitachi | Hitachi Europe\n |\n| 1983–84\n | Cuore\n |\n| 1984–85\n | Rolly Go\n | Oscar Mondadori\n | Arnoldo Mondadori Editore |\n| 1985–86\n | Gianni Rivera\n | Fotorex U-Bix\n | Olivetti |\n| 1986–87\n | Kappa |\n| 1987–90\n | Mediolanum |\n| 1990–92\n | Adidas |\n| 1992–93\n | Motta\n |\n| 1993–94\n | Lotto |\n| 1994–98\n | Opel | General Motors |\n| 1998–06\n | Adidas |\n| 2006–10\n | Bwin |\n| 2010–18\n | Emirates | The Emirates Group |\n| 2018–21\n | Puma[74][75] |\n| 2021–\n | wefox\n | BitMEX |\n\n\n### Kit deals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Contractannouncement\n | Contractduration\n | Value\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adidas | 1998–2018\n | 9 October 2013\n | 2013–2018\n | €20 million per year[76] | Original contract duration: 2013–2023Contract prematurely terminated by mutual consentat the end of the 2017–18 season.[77] |\n| Puma | 2018–present\n | 12 February 2018\n | 2018–present\n | Between €10 million and 15 million per year[78] |  |\n\n\n### Anthem and mascot[edit]\n\n\n\"**AC Milan Anthem – Milan Milan**\" debuted in 1988 and was composed by Tony Renis and Massimo Guantini.[79][80]\n\n\nThe official mascot, designed by Warner Bros., is \"**Milanello**\", a red devil with the AC Milan kit and a ball.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Stadiums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: San Siro\n\n![](image)View of the San Siro in 1934\n![](image)*Curva Sud* of the San Siro\nMilan played their first matches at the *Trotter* pitch, located where the Milan Central railway station would later be built. It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the *Acquabella* pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the *Porta Monforte* pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan played at the *Velodromo Sempione* from 1914 to 1920, and at the *Viale Lombardia* stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team.[81]\n\n\nIn 1926 Milan moved to the stadium where they still play nowadays: The San Siro.\nThe stadium,[15] officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and Internazionale, has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.\n\n\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by UEFA.\n\n\nBased on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems.\n\n\nOn 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the Veltins-Arena – the home of Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen – and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near CityLife district and is served by the metro.[82] On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi called an end to his club's plans to build a new stadium in the city.[83] In 2017, new CEO Marco Fassone stated that the club may look at either staying in the San Siro or moving to a new stadium with the club hierarchy emphasising the need to increase average attendance for home games.[84]\n\n\nOn 27 September 2023, chairman Paolo Scaroni announced the club had filed a proposal to build a new 70,000-seater stadium, alongside the club headquarters and museum in the comune of San Donato Milanese, a suburb south of Milan.[85]\n\n\n\n## Supporters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fossa dei Leoni\n\n![](image)*Brigate Rossonere*\nMilan is one of the most supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper *La Repubblica*.[86] Historically, Milan was supported by the city's working class, which granted them the nickname of *casciavid* (which in Milanese dialect means \"screwdrivers\"), used until the 1960s.[87] On the other hand, crosstown rivals Inter Milan were mainly supported by the more prosperous middle class.[87] The oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, *Fossa dei Leoni*, originated in Milan.[88] Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is *Brigate Rossonere*.[88] Milan ultras have never had any particular political preference,[88] but the media traditionally associated them with the left wing[89] until recently, when Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view.[90]\n\n\nAccording to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans.[91] It had the thirteenth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2019–20 season, behind Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid,\nInter, Schalke 04, Tottenham Hotspur, Celtic, Atlético Madrid, West Ham United and Arsenal.[92]\n\n\n\n## Club rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Derby della Madonnina and Juventus F.C.–AC Milan rivalry\n\n![](image)Scene of a Derby della Madonnina in 1915\nMilan's main rivalry is with its neighbour club, Inter Milan. Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2–1.[93] The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally. In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter. On the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and José Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Suárez (footballer, born 1935) for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder.[94]\n\n\nThe rivalry with Juventus F.C. is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with the greater basin of supporters as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country.[95] Milan and Juventus were often fighting for the top positions of the Serie A standings. Some important periods marked by this rivalry were the early 1950s, which saw the two teams alternating each other as Serie A champions (the two clubs won seven titles in the decade), and big duels between forwards, with the Swedish Gre-No-Li on the *rossoneri* side and the trio formed by Giampiero Boniperti, John Hansen and Karl Aage Præst on the *bianconeri* side; the early 1970s, when for two consecutive seasons, 1971-72 and 1972-73, Milan lost the *scudetto* to Juventus by just one point; the 1990s, when the two clubs dominated the league by winning eight (consecutive) titles out of ten, lining up players that marked the history of football in their era and in the whole history; and finally in the 2000s, when, between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons, the two clubs contested each other the Serie A titles, both won by Juventus but then revoked due to the Calciopoli scandal. The only match played by the two teams in European competitions was the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the first such final between two Italian clubs, won by Milan at the penalties, which granted Milan the sixth Champions League title of their history.[96]\n\n\nThe rivalry with Genoa started at the dawn of the 20th century, when the two clubs repeatedly faced each other for the Italian championship and other important trophies of the time. It then continued in the 1981-82 Serie A season, when Genoa avoided relegation in Naples just a few minutes from the final whistle of the last game of the season condemning the *Rossoneri* to the second Serie B season of their history. The rivalry worsened in 1995 after Genoa fan Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter.[97] Milan also have rivalries with Fiorentina, Atalanta and Napoli.\n\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nIn the movie industry, among the films dedicated to the *Rossoneri* team is Sunday Heroes (1953), by director Mario Camerini, in which the main plot pivots around a fictional football match between the Rossoneri and a club on the brink of relegation. In the film appear, in addition to the coach Lajos Czeizler, many of the Milan players of the time, including Lorenzo Buffon, Carlo Annovazzi and the entire Gre-No-Li trio.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMilan as a fan base and some of their most popular players appeared in several Italian comedy movies. Among them the following are worth mentioning: Eccezzziunale... veramente, Really SSSupercool: Chapter Two (whose cast includes Paolo Maldini, Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, Dida, Andriy Shevchenko and Alessandro Costacurta) and Tifosi (whose cast includes Franco Baresi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Milan TV[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club's foundation, Milan Channel was launched. The subscription-based television channel broadcasts news, events and vintage matches of the club. It is the first Italian thematic channel entirely dedicated to a football team. On 1 July 2016, the channel took on the new name of *Milan TV*, renewing its graphics and logo.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### *Forza Milan!*[edit]\n\n\nIn the editorial field, *Forza Milan!* was the official magazine of the club for over half a century. It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by Panini. Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, with interviews to its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches. Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies. The last issue of the magazine was published in June 2018.[98]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of AC Milan honours, List of AC Milan seasons, and AC Milan in international football\n\n![](image)A partial view of the club's trophy room at the Mondo Milan Museum\nWith a total of 31 domestic honours, Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy. The club won its first Serie A title in 1901 with its most recent coming in 2022. Milan's tenth *scudetto* win meant that it earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of this. \n\n\nMilan is the most successful Italian club in international football with their 18 international trophies. They have won the European Cup/Champions League seven times, an Italian record and only surpassed by Real Madrid, with their most recent coming in 2007. Milan's fifth European Cup win, in 2003, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and is allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt.[99] The club also holds a joint record of four wins in the UEFA Super Cup and a joint record of three wins the Intercontinental Cup. In 2007, Milan won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, completing an international treble of Champions League and Super Cup and Club World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nAC Milan honours\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | Serie A | 19\n | 1901, 1906, 1907, 1950–51, 1954–55, 1956–57, 1958–59, 1961–62, 1967–68, 1978–79, ![](image) 1987–88, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1998–99, 2003–04, 2010–11, 2021–22 |\n| Serie B | 2\n | 1980–81, 1982–83 |\n| Coppa Italia | 5\n | 1966–67, 1971–72, 1972–73, 1976–77, 2002–03 |\n| Supercoppa Italiana | 7\n | 1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 2004, 2011, 2016 |\n| **Continent** | European Cup / UEFA Champions League | 7\n | 1962–63, 1968–69, 1988–89, 1989–90, 1993–94, 2002–03, 2006–07 |\n| European Cup Winners' Cup | 2\n | 1967–68, 1972–73 |\n| European Super Cup / UEFA Super Cup | **5**s | 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007 |\n| **Worldwide** | Intercontinental Cup | **3**s | 1969, 1989, 1990 |\n| FIFA Club World Cup | 1\n | 2007 |\n\n\n* record\n* s shared record\n\n\n## Club statistics and records[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of AC Milan records and statistics\n\n![](image)Paolo Maldini made a record 902 appearances for Milan, including 647 in Serie A.\nPaolo Maldini holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Milan, with 902 official games played in total and 647 in Serie A (as of 31 May 2009, not including playoff matches),[100] the latter being an all-time Serie A record.[101]\n\n\nSwedish forward Gunnar Nordahl scored 38 goals in the 1950–51 season, 35 of which were in Serie A, setting an Italian football and club record. He went on to become Milan's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games.[102] He is followed in second place by Andriy Shevchenko with 175 goals in 322 games, and Gianni Rivera in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years.\n\n\nLegendary tactician Nereo Rocco, the first proponent of *catenaccio* in the country, was Milan's longest-serving manager, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006).\n\n\nThe first official match in which Milan participated was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to Torinese. Milan's largest ever victory was 13–0 against Audax Modena, in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by Bologna.\n\n\nDuring the 1991–92 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978–79), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1–0 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua București's record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic's 68 game unbeaten run.[103][104]\n\n\nSince 2007, along with Boca Juniors, Milan has won more FIFA recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles.[105] They were overtaken by Al Ahly SC from Egypt after their 2014 CAF Confederation Cup win.[106]\n\n\nThe sale of Kaká to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old world football transfer record held by Zinedine Zidane, costing the Spanish club €67 million[107] (about £56 million[108]). That record, however, lasted for less than a month, broken by Cristiano Ronaldo's £80 million transfer.[109] This record, however, is in terms of nominal British pound rates, not adjusted to inflation or the real value of the euro. Madrid bought Zidane for €77.5 million in 2001,[110][111] about £46 million at that time.\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n### First-team squad[edit]\n\n\n*As of 1 September 2023*[112]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Milan\n![](image)Entrance to *Milanello*, the AC Milan training facility\nOn 13 April 2017 Milan became a subsidiary of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg, which acquired 99.9% shares of AC Milan S.p.A. from Fininvest. Li Yonghong became the new chairman[nb 4] and Marco Fassone was confirmed as CEO.[138][139] Li Yonghong's investment vehicle was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg after defaulting to Elliott Management Corporation, which lent a large sum of money to Li to finalise the acquisition.[140][141] Other partners of Elliott were Arena Investors[141] and Blue Skye, according to news reports.[142] Elliott nominated a new board of directors for both Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg and Milan, with Paolo Scaroni as the new chairman (Italian: *presidente*) of the board of Milan. The four previous Chinese member of the board and former CEO Marco Fassone were all dismissed.[143]\n\n\nAccording to *The Football Money League* published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2005–06 season, Milan was the fifth-highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €233.7 million.[144] However, it fell to twelfth in 2013–14 season. The club is also ranked as the eighth-wealthiest football club in the world by *Forbes* magazine as of 2014[update], making it the wealthiest in Italian football, just surpassing ninth-ranked Juventus by a narrow margin.[17]\n\n\nEmirates is the current main sponsor for Milan's shirt starting from the 2010–11 season and through to the 2019–20 season.[145] Previously, German car manufacturer Opel (owned by General Motors) had sponsored Milan for 12 seasons.[146] For most of those 12 years, \"Opel\" was displayed on the front of the shirt, but in the 2003–04 and the 2005–06 seasons respectively, \"Meriva\" and \"Zafira\" (two cars from the company's range) were displayed.\n\n\nThe current shirts are supplied by Puma. Previously it was supplied by German sportswear manufacturer Adidas, whose deal was scheduled to run until 2023.[147] The deal made Adidas the official manufacturer of all kits, training equipment and replica outfits. However, an early termination of the deal was announced in October 2017,[148] effective on 30 June 2018. Prior to Adidas, the Italian sports company Lotto produced Milan's sportswear.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the aggregate 2.5-year financial result in the reporting periods ending at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2017 (a FFP-adjusted net loss of €146 million, €121 million in excess of the acceptable deviation in the regulation[149]: 9), Milan was initially banned from European competitions due to breach in UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. However, the European ban was lifted by an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[149] Milan was allowed to achieve the break even condition on or before 30 June 2021.[150]\n\n\n\n\n\nAC Milan Group  \nconsolidated financial statement  \n(In millions of euros)\n| Year | Revenue | Profit | Total Assets | Equity | Re-capitalization\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006[151] | 00 305.111 | 0000 11.904 | 00 287.065 | ![Decrease](image) −40.768 | ![Decrease](image) 001.464\n |\n| 2007[152] | ![Decrease](image) 275.442 | ![Decrease](image) −031.716 | ![Increase](image) 303.678 | ![Decrease](image) −47.483 | ![Increase](image) 025.000\n |\n| 2008[153][154] | ![Decrease](image) 237.900 | ![Decrease](image) −066.838 | ![Increase](image) 325.625 | ![Decrease](image) −64.482 | ![Increase](image) 050.000\n |\n| 2009[155] (restated)[156] | ![Increase](image) 307.349 | ![Increase](image) −009.836 | ![Increase](image) 394.150 | ![Decrease](image) −71.978 | ![Decrease](image) 002.340\n |\n| 2010[156][157] | ![Decrease](image) 253.196 | ![Decrease](image) −069.751 | ![Decrease](image) 380.868 | ![Decrease](image) −96.693 | ![Increase](image) 045.068\n |\n| 2011[158] | ![Increase](image) 266.811 | ![Increase](image) −067.334 | ![Decrease](image) 363.756 | ![Increase](image) −77.091 | ![Increase](image) 087.060\n |\n| 2012[159] | ![Increase](image) 329.307 | ![Increase](image) −006.857 | ![Decrease](image) 334.284 | ![Increase](image) −54.948 | ![Decrease](image) 029.000\n |\n| 2013[160] | ![Decrease](image) 278.713 | ![Decrease](image) −015.723 | ![Increase](image) 354.595 | ![Decrease](image) −66.921 | ![Decrease](image) 003.750\n |\n| 2014[161][162] | ![Decrease](image) 233.574 | ![Decrease](image) −091.285 | ![Decrease](image) 291.301 | ![Decrease](image) −94.206[nb 5] | ![Increase](image) 064.000\n |\n| 2015 (restated)[163] | ![Decrease](image) 213.426 | ![Increase](image) −089.079 | ![Increase](image) 362.156 | ![Increase](image) −50.557 | ![Increase](image) 150.000\n |\n| 2016[164] | ![Increase](image) 236.128 | ![Increase](image) −074.871 | ![Decrease](image) 315.200 | ![Steady](image) −50.427 | ![Decrease](image) 075.000\n |\n| 2017 (first half)[165][166][167] | ![Decrease](image) 102.866 | ![Increase](image) −032.624 | ![Increase](image) 447.557 | ![Increase](image) 029.969 | ![Increase](image) 059.520 + 53.500\n |\n| 2017–18 | ![Increase](image) 255.733[168]: 42[169][170] | ![Decrease](image) −126.019[168]: 43[169][170] | ![Decrease](image) 435.166[168]: 40 | ![Decrease](image) −36.043[168]: 41[170] | ![Decrease](image) 038.88[171] + 21.1032[172] (59.983)[168]: 115 |\n| 2018–19 | ![Decrease](image) 242.637[173] | ![Decrease](image) −145.985[173] | ![Increase](image) 455.954\n | ![Increase](image) 82.286\n |  |\n| 2019–20\n | ![Decrease](image) 192.317[174] | ![Decrease](image) −194.616[174] | ![Decrease](image) 380.588[174] | ![Decrease](image) 34.124[174] |  |\n| 2020–21\n | ![Increase](image) 261.1[175] | ![Increase](image) −96.4\n | ![Increase](image) 405.7\n | ![Increase](image) 67.3\n |  |\n| 2021–22\n | ![Increase](image) 297.7[176] | ![Increase](image) −66.5\n |  |  |  |\n\n\nNote: Re-capitalization figures were obtained from item *versamenti soci in conto capitale e/o copertura perdite*, for 2006 to 2017 financial year\n\n\n\n## Superleague Formula[edit]\n\n\nMain article: AC Milan (Superleague Formula team)\n\nMilan took part in three editions of the Superleague Formula, from 2008 to 2010. This car competition involved the participation of professional racing teams sponsored by international football teams. The Rossoneri supported the Dutch team Scuderia Playteam in the first season, then Azerti Motorsport in 2009 and the Atech Grand Prix in 2010. The team took several victories and pole positions, and finished third in the final standings of the 2008 championship with Robert Doornbos, former Minardi and Red Bull driver in the Formula 1 World Championship, as main driver.[177] In the same year, Doornbos achieved his team's first victory at the Nürburgring circuit in Germany. Giorgio Pantano drove for Milan in the 2009 season and he has also won races for the team.[178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n\n\n* Milan Lab\n* European Club Association\n* Dynasties in Italian football\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Being in South America, Boca Juniors' and Independiente's titles are with CONMEBOL instead of UEFA\n2. **^** Shared with Barcelona and Real Madrid\n3. **^** Shared with Boca Juniors, Nacional, Peñarol and Real Madrid\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** the Italian word for chairman of the board of directors was *Presidente*.

V.** (**FCB**, pronounced [ˈfuːsbalˌklʊp ˈbaɪɐn ˈmʏnçn̩] ⓘ), also known as **FC Bayern** (pronounced [ˌɛft͡seː ˈbaɪɐn] ⓘ), **Bayern Munich**, or simply **Bayern**, is a German professional sports club based in Munich, Bavaria. It is best known for its professional men's association football team, which plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Bayern is the most successful club in German football history, having won a record 33 national titles, including 11 consecutively since 2013, and 20 national cups, along with numerous European honours.\n\n\nFC Bayern Munich was founded in 1900 by 11 football players, led by Franz John.[4] Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, they won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of the Treble, after which it became the second European club to achieve the feat twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally, and the only German club to have won both international titles. Bayern players have accumulated five Ballon d'Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, four European Golden Shoe and three UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards, including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\n\n\nBy winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the \"sextuple\" (winning the League, Cup, and Champions League in one season followed by the Domestic Supercup, UEFA Supercup and Club World Cup in the next season), or all trophies that a club competes for in a given calendar year. Bayern Munich are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, the only German club to achieve that. As of May 2023, Bayern Munich are ranked second in UEFA club rankings. The club has traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg.\n\n\nSince the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously, the team had played at Munich's Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white, and the crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria. In terms of revenue, Bayern Munich is the largest sports club in Germany and the third highest-earning football club in the world, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, with a value of €634.1 million in 2021.[5] In August 2023, Bayern had more than 300,000 official members and 4,557 officially registered fan clubs, with over 362,000 members. The club has other departments for chess, handball, basketball, gymnastics, bowling, table tennis and senior football, with more than 1,100 active members.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of FC Bayern Munich\n\n### Early years (1900s–1960s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first game of FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Nürnberg in 1901\nFC Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association (DFB), 11 members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against FC Nordstern,[7] and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 South German championship.[4] In the following years, the club won some local trophies and in 1910–11 Bayern joined the newly founded \"Kreisliga\", the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of the First World War in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.[8][9] By the end of its first decade of founding, Bayern had attracted its first German national team player, Max *Gaberl* Gablonsky.[10] By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.[10]\n\n\nIn the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later.[8][11] Its first national title was gained in 1932, when coach Richard \"Little Dombi\" Kohn led the team to the German championship by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2–0 in the final.[8]\n\n\nThe rise of Adolf Hitler to power put an abrupt end to Bayern's development. Club president Kurt Landauer and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the \"Jew's club\" while local rival 1860 Munich gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated in 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. After a friendly match in Switzerland, some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was a spectator, and the club was subject to continued discrimination.[12] Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again, which led to the move of the gifted young centre-forward Oskar Rohr to Switzerland. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.[13]\n\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War in 1945, Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd, the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern ultras *Schickeria*.[14][15] In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the *Oberliga* in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final.[16][17]\n\n\nThe club struggled financially, though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. Manufacturer ousted president Reitlinger, who was later convicted for financial irregularities, was ousted in the elections of 1958 by the industrialist Roland Endler. He provided financial stability for the club. Under his reign, Bayern had its best years in the Oberliga.[18] Endler was no longer a candidate in 1962, when Wilhelm Neudecker, who became wealthy in the postwar construction boom, replaced him.\n\n\nIn 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. The key to qualifying for the Bundesliga was the accumulated record of the last twelve years, where Bayern was only the sixth-ranked club. To boot, local rivals TSV 1860 Munich, ranked seventh, were champions of the last Oberliga-Süd season and were given preference on the basis of this achievement.[19][20] After initial protests by Bayern for alleged mistreatment remained fruitless, president Neudecker rose to the challenge and hired Zlatko Čajkovski, who in 1962 led 1. FC Köln to the national championship. Fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier – who would later be collectively referred to as *the axis*, they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965.[17]\n\n\n\n### The golden years (1960s–1970s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gerd Müller\n![](image)Franz Beckenbauer and Roberto Perfumo before a friendly v Argentina in 1970\nIn their first Bundesliga season, Bayern finished third and also won the DFB-Pokal. This qualified them for the following year's European Cup Winners' Cup, which they won in a dramatic final against Scottish club Rangers, when Franz Roth scored the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory.[17] In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal, but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln and Werder Bremen. Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season.[21]\n\n\nUdo Lattek took charge in 1970. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship. The deciding match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion, and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1 and thus claimed the title, also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored.[22] Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay.[23] This title – after winning the Cup Winners' trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (1968 and 1972) in that competition – marked the club's breakthrough as a force on the international stage.\n\n\n\n![](image)FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Magdeburg in 1974\nDuring the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. \"We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners, but we were very, very lucky\", stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was \"very suspicious\". Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years.[24] A year later in Glasgow, Saint-Étienne were defeated by another Roth goal and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs.[25] The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers.[26] *Bayerndusel* was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.\n\n\n\n### From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1970s–1990s)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed *FC Breitnigge*, led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired, and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in 1982 and 1987.[27]\n\n\nJupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90, Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in 1990–91, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In 1993–94, Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City, who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion.[28] Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.[29]\n\n\nHis successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club's high expectations.[30] During this time, Bayern's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname *FC Hollywood*.[31] Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final.[32] For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Renewed international success (1990s–2000s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Allianz Arena, opened in 2005, is one of the world's most modern football stadiums.\nAfter his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld's first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came close to winning the Champions League, losing 2–1 to Manchester United into injury time after leading for most of the match.[35] The following year, in the club's centenary season, Bayern won the third league and cup double in its history. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal on the final day of the league season.[36][37] Days later, Bayern won the Champions League for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating Valencia on penalties.[38] The 2001–02 season began with a win in the Intercontinental Cup,[39] but ended trophyless otherwise. In 2002–03, Bayern won their fourth double, leading the league by a record margin of 16 points.[40] Hitzfeld's reign ended in 2004, with Bayern underperforming, including defeat by second division Alemannia Aachen in the DFB-Pokal.[41]\n\n\nFelix Magath took over and led Bayern to two consecutive doubles. Prior to the start of the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shared with 1860 Munich.[42] On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.[43]\n\n\nHitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the 2006–07 season in fourth position, thus failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the DFB-Pokal and the DFB-Ligapokal left the club with no honours for the season.\n\n\n\n### Robbery – Robben and Ribery (2000s 2010s)[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild. They signed a total of eight new players and sold, released or loaned out nine of their players.[44] Among new signings were 2006 World Cup stars such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern went on to win the Bundesliga in convincing fashion, leading the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.[45]\n\n\nAfter the season, Bayern's long-term goalkeeper Oliver Kahn retired, which left the club without a top-tier goalkeeper for several seasons.[46] The club's coach Ottmar Hitzfeld also retired and Jürgen Klinsmann was chosen as his successor.[47] However, Klinsmann was sacked even before the end of his first season as Bayern trailed Wolfsburg in the league, had lost the quarterfinal of the DFB-Pokal to Bayer Leverkusen, and had been made look silly in the quarterfinal of the Champions League when FC Barcelona scored four times in the first half of the first leg and over the course of both legs Bayern never looked like they could keep up. Jupp Heynckes was named caretaker coach and led the club to a second-place finish in the league.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bayern Munich playing against Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga in September 2011\nFor the 2009–10 season, Bayern hired Dutch manager Louis van Gaal,[49] and Dutch forward Arjen Robben joined Bayern.[50] Robben, alongside Ribéry, would go on to shape Bayern's playstyle of attacking over the wings for the next ten years. The press quickly dubbed the duo \"Robbery\". In addition, David Alaba and Thomas Müller were promoted to the first team. With Müller, van Gaal went so far as to proclaim, \"With me, Müller always plays,\" which has become a much-referenced phrase over the years.[51] On the pitch Bayern had its most successful season since 2001, securing the domestic double[52] and losing only in the final of the Champions League to Inter Milan 0–2.[53] Despite the successful 2009–10 campaign, van Gaal was fired in April 2011 as Bayern was trailing in the league and eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League, again by Inter. Van Gaal's second in command, Andries Jonker, took over and finished the season in third place.[54]\n\n\nJupp Heynckes returned for his second permanent spell in the 2011–12 season. Although the club had signed Manuel Neuer, ending Bayern's quest for an adequate substitute for Kahn, and Jérôme Boateng for the season, Bayern remained without a title for the second consecutive season, coming in second to Borussia Dortmund in the league and the cup.[55] The Champions League final was held at the Allianz and Bayern indeed reached the final in their home stadium but lost the \"Finale dahoam\" as they had termed it to Chelsea on penalties.[56] For the 2012–13 season, Bayern signed Javi Martínez.[57] After Bayern had finished as runner-up to all titles in 2011–12, Bayern went on to win all titles in 2012–13, setting various Bundesliga records along the way,[58] and becoming the first German team to win the treble. Bayern finished the Bundesliga on 91 points, only 11 points shy of a perfect season, and to date, still, the best season ever played. In what was Bayern's third Champions League final appearance within four years, they beat Borussia Dortmund 2–1.[59] A week later, they completed the treble by winning the DFB-Pokal final over VfB Stuttgart.[60] During the season, in January, Bayern had already announced that they would hire Pep Guardiola as coach for the 2013–14 season. Originally the club presented this as Heynckes retiring on the expiration of his contract, but Uli Hoeneß later admitted that it was not Heynckes's decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season. It was actually forced by the club's desire to appoint Guardiola.[61]\n\n\nBayern fulfilled Guardiola's wish of signing Thiago Alcântara from FC Barcelona,[62] and Guardiola's first season started off well with Bayern extending a streak of undefeated league matches from the last season to 53 matches. The eventual loss to Augsburg came two match days after Bayern had already claimed the league title.[63] During the season, Bayern had also claimed two other titles, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup,[64][65] the latter being the last major trophy the club had not yet won. Bayern also won the cup to complete their tenth domestic double,[66] but lost in the semi-final of the Champions League to Real Madrid.[67] Off the pitch, Bayern's president Uli Hoeneß was convicted of tax evasion on 13 March 2014 and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Hoeneß resigned the next day.[68] Vice-president Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 May. Before the 2014–15 season, Bayern picked up Robert Lewandowski after his contract had ended at Borussia Dortmund,[69] and loaned out Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid.[70] Bayern also let Toni Kroos leave for Real.[71] Club icons Bastian Schweinsteiger and Claudio Pizarro left before the 2015–16 season.[72][73] In these two seasons, Bayern defended their league title, including another double in 2015–16,[74] but failed to advance past the semi-finals in the Champions League. Although the club's leadership tried to convince Guardiola to stay, the coach decided not to extend his three-year contract.[75]\n\n\nCarlo Ancelotti was hired as successor to Guardiola.[76] The key transfer for the 2016–17 campaign was Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund.[77] Off the pitch Uli Hoeneß had been released early from prison and reelected as president in November 2016.[78] Under Ancelotti, Bayern claimed their fifth consecutive league title,[79] but did not win the cup or the Champions League. In July 2017, Bayern announced that 1860 Munich would leave the Allianz for good as the club had been relegated to the 4th division.[80] Before the 2017–18 season, Bayern made extensive changes to their squad, signing amongst others young prospects such as Kingsley Coman, Corentin Tolisso, Serge Gnabry and Niklas Süle, and loaning James Rodríguez from Real. Meanwhile, the club's captain, Philipp Lahm, and Xabi Alonso retired, and several other players left the club.[81] As Bayern's performances were perceived to be increasingly lacklustre, Ancelotti was sacked after a 0–3 loss to Paris St. Germain in the Champions League, early in his second season.[82] Willy Sagnol took over as interim manager for a week before it was announced that Jupp Heynckes would finish the season in his fourth spell at the club.[83] During the season, the club urged Heynckes —even publicly— to extend his contract, but Heynckes, aged 73, stayed firm that he would retire for good after the season.[84] The club began a long and extensive search to find a replacement, and eventually Niko Kovač was presented as Heynckes's successor, signing a three-year contract.[85] Heynckes led the club to another championship. In the cup final, Heynckes's last match as coach, Heynckes met his successor on the pitch. Kovač's Eintracht Frankfurt denied Bayern the title, winning 3–1.[86]\n\n\nKovač's first season at the club started slowly, with Bayern falling behind Dortmund in the league throughout the first half of the season. In contrast to similar situations with van Gaal and Ancelotti, the club's leadership decided to protect their coach from criticisms.[87] However, after the winter break, Bayern quickly closed the distance and put themselves first-place in the league. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated by Liverpool in the round of 16, the first time since 2011 that Bayern did not reach the quarterfinal.[88] During the season Arjen Robben announced that it would be his last season for the club,[89] while Uli Hoeneß announced that Franck Ribéry would be leaving at the end of the season.[90] In March 2019, Bayern announced that they had signed Lucas Hernandez from Atlético Madrid for a club and Bundesliga record fee of €80 million.[91][92] On 18 May 2019, Bayern won their seventh straight Bundesliga title as they finished two points above second-place Dortmund with 78 points. This Bundesliga title was Ribéry's ninth and Robben's eighth.[93] A week later, Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final. With the win, Bayern won their 19th German Cup and completed their 12th domestic double.[94]\n\n\n\n### German coaches era (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### Flick era (2010s–2020s)[edit]\n\n\nHansi Flick joined Bayern Munich on 1 July 2019 as an assistant coach.[95] Under Kovač, Bayern was off to a slow start in the league and after a 5–1 loss to Frankfurt, Kovač and Bayern parted ways on 3 November 2019 with Flick being promoted to interim manager.[96][97] After a satisfying spell as interim coach, Bayern announced on 22 December 2019 that Flick would remain in charge until the end of season.[98] Bayern's performances on the pitch picked up noticeably and in April 2020, the club agreed with Flick to a new permanent contract through 2023.[99] Under Flick the club won the league, having played the most successful leg of a Bundesliga season in history,[100] and went on to claim the cup, thus completing the club's 13th domestic double.[101] In the Champions League, Bayern reached their first final since 2013, en route beating FC Barcelona 8–2 in the quarter-finals[102] and Lyon 3–0 in the semi-final.[103] In the final, which was held in Lisbon behind closed doors due to the severity of COVID-19 pandemic, they defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0. Former PSG player Kingsley Coman scored the only goal of the match.[104] With the victory, they became the second European club to complete the seasonal treble in two different seasons, matching the 2014–15 FC Barcelona team.[105]\n\n\nAfter a short break, Bayern started the new season by winning the UEFA Super Cup for the second time in their history. In a closely contested match, Bayern defeated Sevilla 2–1 after extra time, with Javi Martínez scoring the winning goal.[106] On 30 September 2020, they won the 2020 DFL-Supercup after defeating the runners-up of the Bundesliga Dortmund 3–2.[107] In February 2021, they won the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup (postponed from December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) after defeating African champions Al Ahly SC 2–0 by a brace from Robert Lewandowski,[108] and then winning in the final against Mexican team Tigres UANL 1–0 after a goal from Benjamin Pavard and became only the second club to win the sextuple, after Barcelona won it in 2009.[109] Later, Bayern failed to defend its Champions League title, losing to PSG in the quarter-finals on away goals following a 3–3 aggregate draw.[110] However, it managed to win its 9th Bundesliga title in a row.[111] During the season, Robert Lewandowski broke Gerd Müller's record for the number of goals scored in a Bundesliga season after scoring 41 times.[112]\n\n\nOn 27 April 2021, Bayern announced that Flick would be leaving at the end of the season, at his request, and that RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann would become the new manager, effective 1 July.[113] According to multiple reports, Bayern paid Leipzig €25m, a world record for a manager, as compensation for Nagelsmann's services.[114] It was later announced that Flick was leaving to take charge of the German national team of which he had previously been the assistant coach under manager Joachim Löw.[115]\n\n\n\n#### Nagelsmann era (2020s)[edit]\n\n\nUnder new coach Julian Nagelsmann, Bayern have completed the feat of winning 10 consecutive Bundesliga titles following a 3–1 Der Klassiker win.[116] However, the team unexpectedly lost to Villarreal in the Champions League quarter-finals, going out at that stage for the second year in a row.[117] On 24 March 2023, Nagelsmann was released by Bayern and replaced by Thomas Tuchel, who received a contract until 30 June 2025.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Tuchel era (2020s–present)[edit]\n\n\nOn 25 March 2023, Thomas Tuchel was presented at a press conference as the new Bayern manager.[119] With Tuchel in charge, Bayern was immediately eliminated from the DFB-Pokal in the quarter-finals by SC Freiburg,[120] and also in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Manchester City F.C.[121] However, he led them to a record 11th consecutive title by beating 1. FC Köln and winning a close title race with Borussia Dortmund.[122] Oliver Kahn and Hasan Salihamidzic were both dismissed after the club secured the Bundesliga title. Jan-Christian Dreesen replaced Kahn as CEO with a new sporting director yet to be announced.[123] Bayern appointed Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as member of the FC Bayern München AG supervisory board at their regular meeting on 30 May 2023.[124] Bayern Munich have appointed Christoph Freund as the club's new sporting director from 1 September.[125]\n\n\nOn 12 August 2023, Bayern broke the German transfer record again, this time to sign England's captain and all-time leading goalscorer Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of €110m.[126]\n\n\n\n## Kits[edit]\n\n\nIn the original club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905 when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which were meant as an insult.[4] For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all-red home kit with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.[127] Bayern also wore a *Rotwein* coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first-choice colours prior to the late 1960s.[128]\n\n\nThe club's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the 2013–14 season, Bayern used an all-red home kit with a Bavarian flag diamond watermark pattern, a *Lederhosen* inspired white and black *Oktoberfest* away kit, and an all navy blue international kit.[129]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, representing the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there.[130][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt sponsor (chest)\n | Shirt sponsor (sleeve)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1964–1971\n | Palme Trikotfabrik[131] | None\n | None\n |\n| 1971–1974\n | Erima\n |\n| 1974–1978\n | Adidas | Adidas |\n| 1978–1981\n | Magirus Deutz |\n| 1981–1984\n | Iveco Magirus |\n| 1984–1989\n | Commodore |\n| 1989–2002\n | Opel |\n| 2002–2017\n | Deutsche Telekom |\n| 2017–2018\n | Hamad Airport |\n| 2018–2023\n | Qatar Airways |\n| 2023–present\n | Audi |\n\n\n### Kit deals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier | Period | Latest contractannouncement | Current contractduration | Value | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adidas | 1974–present\n | 28 April 2015\n | 2015–2030 (15 years)\n | Total €900 million (€60 million per year)\n | [132][133] |\n\n\n## Crest[edit]\n\n\nBayern's crest has changed several times. Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954.[127] The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for *Fußball-Abteilung*, i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.\n\n\nThe modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.[127] While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.\n\n\n\nBayern Munich logo history\n* ![1901](image)\n\n1901\n* ![1902–1906](image)\n\n1902–1906\n* ![1906–1919](image)\n\n1906–1919\n* ![1919–1924](image)\n\n1919–1924\n* ![1925–1954[a]](image)\n\n1925–1954[a]\n* ![1954–1996](image)\n\n1954–1996\n* ![1996–2002](image)\n\n1996–2002\n* ![2002–2017](image)\n\n2002–2017\n* ![2017–](image)\n\n2017–\n\n## Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Bayern's first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924\nBayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße.[135] As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.[136]\n\n\nFrom 1925, Bayern shared the Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich.[137] Until World War II, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as *Sechz'ger* (\"Sixties\") Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season.[138] In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.[139][140]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Olympiastadion, home of Bayern Munich from 1972 to 2005\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics, the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion. The stadium, renowned for its architecture,[141] was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971–72 season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. In its early days, the stadium was considered one of the foremost stadiums in the world and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of 1974 FIFA World Cup.[142] In the following years the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 per cent to 66 per cent.[*clarification needed*] Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect Günther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium.[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena is lit in red for Bayern home games.\nAfter much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005–06 season.[143] Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio.[144] Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000.[145] In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).[146]\n\n\nThe stadium's most prominent feature is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colors for impressive effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for German national team home games.[147]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.[148]\n\n\n\n## Supporters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A part of the \"Südkurve\" – the usual spot of the ultra-scene at Allianz Arena\nAt the 2018 annual general meeting, the Bayern board reported that the club had 291,000 official members and there are 4,433 officially registered fan clubs with over 390,000 members.[149] This makes the club the largest fan membership club in the world.[150] Bayern have fan clubs and supporters all over Germany. Fan club members from all over Germany and nearby Austria and Switzerland often travel more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) to Munich to attend home games at the Allianz Arena.[151] Bayern has an average of 75,000 attendees at the Allianz Arena which is at 100 per cent capacity level. Every Bundesliga game has been sold-out for years.[152] Bayern's away games have been sold out for many years.[153] According to a study by Sport+Markt Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, and the most popular football club in Germany with 10 million supporters.[154]\n\n\nBayern Munich is also renowned for its well-organised ultra scene. The most prominent groups are the *Schickeria München*, the *Inferno Bavaria*, the *Red Munichs '89*, the *Südkurve '73*, the *Munichmaniacs 1996*, the *Red Angels*, and the *Red Sharks*. The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognised for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, racism and homophobia,[155][156][157] and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.[158][159][160][161]\n\n\nFC Bayern Munich are the world's largest football club in terms of members. The Red Ladies are Bayern Munich's first and only international all-female supporter club with over 200 members.[162] They are known for being super fans and creating a safe community for women to talk about the club.[163]\n\n\nStern des Südens is the song which fans sing at FCB home games. In the 1990s they also used to sing *FC Bayern, Forever Number One*.[164] Another notable song is *Mia San Mia*[b] (Bavarian for \"we are who we are\") which is a famous motto of the club as well.[166] A renowned catchphrase for the team is \"*Packmas*\" which is a Bavarian phrase for the German \"*Packen wir es*\", which means \"let's do it\".[167] The team's mascot is called \"Berni\" since 2004.[168]\n\n\nThe club also has a number of high-profile supporters, among them Pope Benedict XVI,[169] Boris Becker, Wladimir Klitschko, Horst Seehofer and Edmund Stoiber, former Minister-President of Bavaria.[170]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bavarian football derbies, Munich derby, and Der Klassiker\n\n![](image)A Munich derby match at the Allianz Arena between Bayern and 1860 Munich in the quarter-final of the 2007–08 DFB-Pokal on 27 February 2008\nBayern is one of three professional football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who was the more successful club in the 1950s and was controversially picked for the initial Bundesliga season in 1963, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting much extra attention from supporters of both clubs.[171] Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.[172]\n\n\nSince the 1920s, 1. FC Nürnberg has been Bayern's main and traditional[173] rival in Bavaria. Philipp Lahm said that playing Nürnberg is \"always special\" and is a \"heated atmosphere\".[173] Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, Nürnberg was far more successful, winning five championships in the 1920s, making the club Germany's record champion. Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later, when they won their tenth championship in 1987, thereby surpassing the number of championships won by Nürnberg.[173][174] The duel between Bayern and Nürnberg is often referred to as the Bavarian Derby.\n\n\nBayern also enjoys a strong rivalry with the 1. FC Kaiserslautern, originating in parts from a game in 1973, when Bayern lost 7–4 after leading 4–1,[175][176] but also from the two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga as well as the city of Kaiserslautern together with the surrounding Palatinate having been part of Bavaria until a plebiscite after the end of the Second World War.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bayern Munich won 2–1 against Borussia Dortmund to win the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League on 25 May 2013.\nSince the 1970s, Bayern's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. In the 1970s this was Borussia Mönchengladbach,[23] in the 1980s the category expanded to include Hamburger SV. In the 1990s, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen[177][178] emerged as the most ardent opponents. Recently Borussia Dortmund, Schalke,[179] and Werder Bremen have been the main challengers in the Bundesliga. Recently, Bayern's main Bundesliga challenger has been Borussia Dortmund.[180] Bayern and Dortmund have competed against each other for many Bundesliga titles. They also have played against each other in the DFB-Pokal final in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2016. The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a DFB-Pokal final. Bayern and Dortmund have also played against each other in the DFL-Supercup in 1989, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The height of the competition between the two clubs was when Bayern defeated Dortmund 2–1 in the final of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League.\n\n\nAmongst Bayern's chief European rivals are Real Madrid,[181] A.C. Milan,[182] and Manchester United due to many classic wins, draws and losses.[177] Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches. Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"*Bestia negra*\" (\"Black Beast\"). Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup.\n\n\n\n## Organization and finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bayern's former president from 1994 to 2009 and former player Franz Beckenbauer\nSee also: Most valuable sports teams\n\nBayern is led mostly by former club players. From 2016 to 2019, Uli Hoeneß served as the club's president, following Karl Hopfner who had been in office from 2014; Hoeneß had resigned in 2014 after being convicted of tax fraud.[183][184] Oliver Kahn was the chairman of the executive board of the AG.[185] The supervisory board of nine consists mostly of managers of big German corporations. Besides the club's president and the board's chairman, they are Herbert Hainer former CEO of (Adidas), Dr. Herbert Diess chairman of (Volkswagen), Dr. Werner Zedelius senior advisor at (Allianz), Timotheus Höttges CEO of (Deutsche Telekom), Prof. Dr. Dieter Mayer, Edmund Stoiber, Theodor Weimer CEO of (Deutsche Börse), and Dr. Michael Diederich speaker of the board at (UniCredit Bank).[186][187]\n\n\nProfessional football at Bayern is run by the spin-off organisation *FC Bayern München AG*. *AG* is short for *Aktiengesellschaft*, and Bayern is run like a joint stock company, a company whose stock are not listed on the public stock exchange, but is privately owned. 75 per cent of *FC Bayern München AG* is owned by the club, the *FC Bayern München e. V.* (*e. V.* is short for *Eingetragener Verein*, which translates into \"Registered Club\"). Three German corporations, the sports goods manufacturer Adidas, the automobile company Audi and the financial services group Allianz each hold 8.33 per cent of the shares, 25 per cent in total.[185] Adidas acquired its shares in 2002 for €77 million. The money was designated to help finance the Allianz Arena.[188] In 2009 Audi paid €90 million for their share. The capital was used to repay the loan on the Allianz Arena.[189] And in early 2014, Allianz became the third shareholder of the company acquiring theirs share for €110 million. With the sale, Bayern paid off the remaining debt on the Allianz Arena 16 years ahead of schedule.[190] Bayern's other sports departments are run by the club.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bayern Munich team bus provided by sponsor MAN\nBayern's shirt sponsor is Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has been Bayern's shirt sponsor since the start of 2002–03 season. The company extended their sponsorship deal in August 2015 until the end of the 2026–27 season.[191] Bayern's kit sponsor is Adidas. Adidas have been Bayern's kit sponsor since 1974. Adidas extended their sponsorship with Bayern on 29 April 2015. The sponsorship deal runs until the end of the 2029–30 season.[192] The premium partners are Audi, Allianz, HypoVereinsbank, Goodyear, Qatar Airways, Siemens, Paulaner Brewery, SAP, DHL, Hamad International Airport and Tipico. Gold sponsors are Coca-Cola, MAN, Procter & Gamble. Classic sponsors are Apple Music, Bayern 3, Beats Electronics, EA Sports, Gigaset, Hugo Boss, Courtyard by Marriott, Veuve Clicquot, and Adelholzener.[193] In previous years the jersey rights were held by Adidas[194] (1974–78), Magirus Deutz and Iveco[195] (1978–84), Commodore[196] (1984–89) and Opel[197] (1989–2002).\n\n\nBayern is an exception in professional football, having generated profits for 27 consecutive years.[149] Other clubs often report losses, realising transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. In the 2019 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, Bayern had the fourth-highest revenue in club football, generating revenue of €629.2 million. Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. The top 20 European football clubs earned 43 per cent of revenue, on average, from broadcasting rights. Bayern earned the only 28 per cent of their revenue that way. Bayern had the second-highest commercial revenue in the 2019 Deloitte Football Money League, behind only Real Madrid. Bayern's commercial revenue was €348.7 million (55 per cent of total revenue). In contrast, Bayern's Matchday revenue trails other top clubs at €103.8 million (17 per cent of their total revenue).[198]\n\n\nWhile other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern had focused on Germany.[199] In recent years Bayern have started to focus their marketing more on Asia and the United States. Bayern made summer tours to the United States in 2014 and 2016. Bayern went to China in the summer of 2015 and returned in the summer of 2017 where they also played games in Singapore. In August 2014 Bayern opened an office in New York City as the club wants to strengthen their brand positioning against other top European clubs in the United States.[200] In March 2017, Bayern was the first foreign football club to open an office in mainland China. Bayern hope to attract new sponsors and to increase their merchandising sales. In 2017, Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fourth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club's value at €2.5 billion.[201]\n\n\nAs a result of Bayern's appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, the club's brand value has reached US$786 million, up 59 per cent from the previous year. Among European teams, this is ahead of Real Madrid's US$600 million and behind first-placed Manchester United, whose brand is valued at US$853 million. In 2013, Bayern overtook Manchester United to take first place in brand valuation.[202]\n\n\nBayern's financial report for the 2018–19 season reported revenue of €750.4 million and an operating profit of €146.1 million. Post-tax profits were €52.5 million which meant that this was Bayern's 27th consecutive year with a profit.[149]\n\n\nIn 2022, FC Bayern announced the opening of an international office in Bangkok; marking their third such branch office.[203]\n\n\n\n## Social engagement and charity[edit]\n\n\nBayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time, helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery. In the wake of the 2004 Tsunami the \"FC Bayern – Hilfe e.V.\" was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club.[204] At its inception this venture was funded with €600,000, raised by officials and players of the club.[205] The money was amongst other things used to build a school in Marathenkerny, Sri Lanka[205] and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. In April 2007 it was decided that the focus of the foundation would shift towards supporting people in need locally.[204]\n\n\nThe club has also assisted sport clubs in financial disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers.[206] Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its licence for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli.[207] More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club.[208] Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners.[209] In 2003, Bayern provided a €2 Million loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid.[210][211][212] On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.[213] On 30 August 2017, Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled Kickers Offenbach. All the revenue from the match went to Kickers Offenbach. Bayern's chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, \"Kickers Offenbach are a club with a rich tradition, they've always been an important club in Germany, so we'll gladly help them with a benefit match.\"[214] On 27 May 2019, Bayern played a benefit match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. The match was played so Kaiserslautern could secure their licence to play in the German third division. All income from the match went to Kaiserslautern.[215] \"1. FC Kaiserslautern are one of Germany's biggest traditional clubs,\" Bayern's chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. \"For many years there were intense, and in retrospect also legendary, Bayern matches at Kaiserslautern. Football is all about emotions and sporting rivalries, but also about solidarity. That's why we're happy to help and hope 1. FC Kaiserslautern can once again gain promotion back to the Bundesliga in the foreseeable future.\"[216]\n\n\nIn mid 2013, Bayern was the first club to give financial support to the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation. The foundation researches the living environment LGBT people, and developed an education concept to facilitate unbiased dealing with LGBT themes in football.[217]\n\n\nIn 2016, FC Bayern received the Nine Values Cup, an award of the international children's social programme Football for Friendship.[218]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019/20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.[219]\n\n\n\n## Training facility[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Bayern Munich Headquarters\nFC Bayern Munich headquarters and training facility is called Säbener Straße and it is located in the Untergiesing-Harlaching borough of Munich. The first team and the reserve team train at the facility.[220] There are five grass pitches, two of which have undersoil heating, two artificial grass fields, a beach volleyball court and a multi-functional sports hall.[221]\n\n\n\n![](image)FC Bayern Football pitch (training only)\nThe players' quarters opened in 1990 and were reconstructed after the 2007–08 season on suggestions by then new coach, Jürgen Klinsmann, who took inspiration from various major sports clubs. The quarters are now called the performance centre and feature weights and fitness areas, a massage unit, dressing rooms, the coaches' office, and a conference room with screening facilities for video analysis. A café, a library, an e-Learning room, and a family room are also included.\n\n\nUntil August 2017, the Youth House was located at the headquarters at Säbener Straße. The Youth House housed up to 14 young talents aged 15 to 18 from outside of Munich. Former residents of the Youth House include Bastian Schweinsteiger, David Alaba, Owen Hargreaves, Michael Rensing, Holger Badstuber and Emre Can.\n\n\nIn 2006, Bayern purchased land near the Allianz Arena with the purpose of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started after overcoming internal resistance. The project's main reasons were that the existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at the senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at the youth level. The new facility was scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.[222] On 21 August 2017 the FC Bayern Campus opened at a cost of €70 million. The campus is located north of Munich at Ingolstädter Straße. The campus is 30 hectare and has 8 football pitches for youth teams from the U-9s to the U-19s and the women's and girls' teams. The campus also has a 2,500-capacity stadium where the U-17s and the U-19s play their matches. The Allianz FC Bayern Akademie is located on the campus site, and the academy has 35 apartments for young talents who don't live in the Greater Munich area. The academy building also has offices for youth coaches and staff.[223]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of FC Bayern Munich records and statistics § Honours\n\nBayern is historically the most successful team in German football, as they have won the most championships and the most cups. They are also Germany's most successful team in international competitions, having won fourteen trophies. Bayern is the only club to have won all three major European competitions, have won three consecutive European Cups and won the treble twice, one of which was part of the larger and more elusive \"sextuple\" (2020).\n\n\n\n![](image)The three consecutive European Cup trophies won by FC Bayern Munich from 1974 to 1976.

Udo Lattek, Giovanni Trapattoni and Ottmar Hitzfeld served two terms as head coach. Franz Beckenbauer served one term as head coach and one as caretaker, while Jupp Heynckes had four separate spells as coach, including one as caretaker.[232] Lattek was the club's most successful coach, having won six Bundesliga titles, two DFB Cups and the European Cup; following closely is Ottmar Hitzfeld, who won five Bundesliga titles, two DFB Cups and the Champions League. The club's least successful coach was Søren Lerby, who won less than a third of his matches in charge and presided over the club's near-relegation in the 1991–92 campaign.\n\n\nOn 3 November 2019, Bayern sacked Niko Kovač after a 5–1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt and appointed Hansi Flick as a coach. Initially, Flick was installed as caretaker coach only, however on 15 November, after Flick's team had won 4–0 against Borussia Dortmund, Bayern announced that Flick would be in charge at least until Christmas 2019.[233] Later on, Flick signed a new contract until 2023.[99]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Coach\n | Period\n | MajorTitles\n | Domestic\n | European\n | Worldwide\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |

reserve team serves mainly as the final stepping stone for promising young players before being promoted to the main team. The second team is coached by Sebastian Hoeneß.[238] The second team play in the 3. Liga for the 2019–20 season. Since the inception of the Regionalliga in 1994, the team played in the Regionalliga Süd, after playing in the Oberliga since 1978. In the 2007–08 season, they qualified for the newly founded 3. Liga, where they lasted until 2011 when they were relegated to the Regionalliga. This ended 33 consecutive years of playing in the highest league that the German Football Association permits the second team of a professional football team to play.[45][239]\n\n\n\n#### Junior teams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The FC Bayern Academy at the campus in Munich\nMain article: FC Bayern Campus\n\nMain article: FC Bayern Munich Junior Team\n\nThe youth academy has produced some of Europe's top football players, including Thomas Hitzlsperger, Owen Hargreaves, Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Müller. On 1 August 2017, the FC Bayern Campus became the new home of the youth teams. It consists of ten teams, with the youngest being under 9.[240][241] Jochen Sauer is the FC Bayern Campus director and Bayern legend coach Hermann Gerland is the sporting director.\n\n\n\n#### Women's team[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FC Bayern Munich (women)\n\nThe women's football department consists of five teams, including a professional team, a reserve team, and two youth teams. The women's first team, which is led by head coach Thomas Wörle, features several members of the German national youth team. In the 2008–09 season, the team finished second in the women's Bundesliga. The division was founded in 1970 and consisted of four teams with 90 players. Their greatest successes were winning the championships in 1976, 2015, and 2016.[242] In the 2011–12 season on 12 May 2012, FC Bayern Munich dethroned the German Cup title holders 1. FFC Frankfurt with a 2–0 in the 2011–12 final in Cologne and celebrated the biggest success of the club's history since winning the championship in 1976. In 2015 they won the Bundesliga for the first time, without any defeat. They won the 2015–16 Bundesliga for the second consecutive time.[243]\n\n\n\n#### Senior football[edit]\n\n\nThe senior football department was founded in 2002, making it the youngest division of the club, and consists of five teams. The division is intended to enable senior athletes to participate in the various senior citizen competitions in Munich.[244]\n\n\n\n#### AllStars[edit]\n\n\nThe FC Bayern AllStars were founded in summer 2006, and consists of former Bayern players, including Klaus Augenthaler, Raimond Aumann, Andreas Brehme, Paul Breitner, Hans Pflügler, Stefan Reuter, Paulo Sérgio, and Olaf Thon. The team is coached by Wolfgang Dremmler, and plays matches with other senior teams around the world. For organisational reasons, the team can only play a limited number of games annually.[245]\n\n\n\n### Other sports[edit]\n\n\nBayern has other departments for a variety of sports.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FC Bayern Munich (basketball)\n\nThe basketball department was founded in 1946, and currently contains 26 teams, including four men's teams, three women's teams, sixteen youth teams, and three senior teams. The men's team are five-time German champions, having won in 1954, 1955, 2014, 2018, and 2019. The team also won the German Basketball Cup in 1968, 2018, and 2021. The team plays its home games at the Rudi-Sedlmayer-Halle, located in the Sendling-Westpark borough of Munich.[246][247]\n\n\n\n#### Bowling[edit]\n\n\nThe bowling department emerged from SKC Real-Isaria in 1983 and currently consists of five teams. Directly next to the well-known club building of the football department, the team plays at the bowling alley of the Münchner Kegler-Verein. The first team plays in the second highest division of the Münchner Spielklasse Bezirksliga.[248][249]\n\n\n\n#### Chess[edit]\n\n\nThe department was created in 1908 and consists of nine teams, including seven men's teams and two women's teams. The men's team, which currently plays in the Chess Bundesliga following promotion in 2013 from the 2. Bundesliga Ost, was nine-time German Champion from 1983 to 1995. The team also won the European Chess Club Cup in 1992. The women currently play in the 2. Bundesliga with their biggest successes being promotion to the Frauenbundesliga in 2016[250] and 2018.[251]\n\n\n\n#### Handball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of the handball department\nThe handball department was founded in 1945, and consists of thirteen teams, including three men's teams, two women's teams, five boys teams, two girls teams, and a mixed youth team. The first men's team plays in the Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern, while the women's first teams plays in the Bezirksliga Oberbayern.[252][253]\n\n\n\n#### Referees[edit]\n\n\nThe refereeing department was established in 1919 and is currently the largest football refereeing division in Europe, with 110 referees, with 2 of them women. The referees mainly officiate amateur games in the local Munich leagues.[254][255]\n\n\n\n#### Table tennis[edit]\n\n\nThe table tennis department was founded in 1946 and currently has 220 members. The club currently has fourteen teams, including eight men's teams, a women's team, three youth teams, and two children teams. The women's first team is currently playing in the Landesliga Süd/Ost, while the men's first team plays in the 3. Bundesliga Süd. The focus of the department is on youth support.[256][257]\n\n\n\n### Defunct[edit]\n\n\n#### Baseball[edit]\n\n\nThe baseball division existed during the 1960s and 1970s, during which the team won two German championships in 1962 and 1969.\n\n\n\n#### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1966 to 1969, Bayern had an ice hockey team, which completed two seasons in the Eishockey-Bundesliga.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1965, the Münchner Eislauf Verein negotiated with Bayern Munich about joining the club. Although the talks came to nothing, the ice hockey department of Münchner Eislauf Verein decided to join Bayern –mid-season– in January 1966. The team finished the season under the name of Bayern Munich in third place of the second-tier Oberliga. The following season Bayern achieved promotion to the Bundesliga where the club stayed for two seasons. However, in 1969 the club disbanded the department and sold the hockey team to Augsburger EV, citing lack of local support and difficulty in recruiting players as reasons.[258]\n\n\n\n#### Gymnastics[edit]\n\n\nThe gymnastics department was founded in 1974 and was most successful in the 1980s. During this time, the team won four German championships in 1983, 1986, 1987, and 1988. In 2014, the division was dissolved.\n\n\n\n## Literature[edit]\n\n\n* Hüetlin, Thomas: *Gute Freunde.

Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed *Blaugrana*.\n\n\nDomestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5][6][7] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023[update].[8][9][10] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as *El Clásico*.\n\n\nBarcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[11][12] Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[13][14] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[15]\n\n\nBarcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[16][17] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.[18] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.[19] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[20][21][22] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of FC Barcelona\n\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona seasons\n\n### 1899–1922: Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walter Wild, the club's first president (1899–1901).

Our friend and partner, Mr. Kans Kamper, from the Foot-Vall Section of the 'Sociedad Los Deportes' and former Swiss champion, wishing to organise some matches in Barcelona, requests that everyone who likes this sport contact him, come to this office Tuesday and Friday nights from 9 to 11.\"[25]\nOn 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in *Los Deportes* declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[25][26]\n\n\n\n![](image)A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903\nFC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the very first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware,[27] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.[28] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\"[29] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[30]\n\n\nOn 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[31]\n\n\nThe stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[32] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[33] Notable figures of Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru and Jack Greenwell.[34] The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[35]\n\n\nDuring the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[36] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[37]\n\n\nGamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[38] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[39]\n\n\nIn 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga and Franz Platko.[40] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.[41][30]\n\n\n\n### 1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white photo of the city from high above. Smoke from a bomb can be seen](image)The aerial bombardment of Barcelona in 1938\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[42] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Team of FC Barcelona, published on *El Gráfico*, 1926\nOn 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[43] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[44] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[30]\n\n\nAlthough they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[45] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,[41] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them.\n\n\nA month after the entire Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[46] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[47] He was dubbed the martyr of *barcelonisme*, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[48] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[49][50]\n\n\nOn 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[51][52] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to *Club de Fútbol Barcelona* and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)A prolific forward, László Kubala led Barcelona to success in the 1950s. His statue is built outside the Camp Nou.\nIn 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[55] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[56]\n\n\nDespite the difficult political situation, *CF Barcelona* enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[57] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[58] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[59]\n\n\nOn a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[60][61]\n\n\nCoach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini & Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[39]\n\n\n\n### 1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona line up against Hamburger SV before the 1960–61 European Cup semi-final\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[62][63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Suárez, the first Barcelona player to win the Ballon d'Or\nThe 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[63] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to *Futbol Club Barcelona* and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[64][65]\n\n\nThe 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[66] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[67] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[41] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[68]\n\n\n\n### 1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1979, Barcelona bought La Masia, a farmer's house built in 1702, to be a residence for young academy players. It would later play a significant role in the club's future success.[69][70]\nIn 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[71][72]\n\n\nOn 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling *blaugrana* fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)Diego Maradona's *blaugrana* shirt on display in the FC Barcelona Museum\nIn June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[74] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.[71]\n\n\nAround this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[75] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[76]\n\n\nAfter the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[71]\n\n\n\n#### The *Dream Team* era[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)As coach of the \"Dream Team\", Johan Cruyff won four consecutive league titles with Barcelona.\nIn 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\".[77] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Zubizarreta (C)**\n**Koeman**\n**Nando**\n**Ferrer**\n**Juan Carlos**\n**Eusebio**\n**Guardiola**\n**Bakero**\n**Laudrup**\n**Salinas**\n**Stoichkov**\nStarting lineup for the 1992 European Cup Final, the club's first European Cup/Champions League winning team\n\nIt was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was future Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.[79]\nUnder Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[80] Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[71] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, \"Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it.\"[81]\n\n\nReacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[82] The objective of the group, called *L'Elefant Blau*, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[82][83] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[84]\n\n\nCruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.[85] Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[86]\n\n\nLike Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.[85] However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its *centenari*, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque commemorating the centenary of FC Barcelona\nThe departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[87] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.[88][89][90]\n\n\nDespite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ronaldinho's arrival in 2003 revitalized the club.[92][93]\nAfter the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Valdés**\n**Márquez**\n**Puyol (C)**\n**Oleguer**\n**van Bronckhorst**\n**Edmílson**\n**Giuly**\n**Ronaldinho**\n**Deco**\n**van Bommel**\n**Eto'o**\nBarcelona's victorious 2006 Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[95] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[96]\n\n\nDespite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[97] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[98] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[99] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.[100]\n\n\nBarcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[101]\n\n\n\n### 2008–2012: Guardiola era[edit]\n\n\n![A man wearing long, dark blue shorts and a light blue sweatshirt under an orange bib.](image)\n![A man wearing a light blue sweatshirt and dark blue shorts.](image)\nBarcelona's midfield combination of Andrés Iniesta (left) and Xavi (right) were at the heart of Guardiola's tiki-taka passing style of play.[102]\n\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[101] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi in action during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final victory against Manchester United.\nBarça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time.[104] A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions.[105] Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[106][107][108] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[109] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[110] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[111] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[112][113]\n\n\nAfter Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he got 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[114] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[115] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[116] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[117]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in *El Clásico*.[118] At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.[119] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[120] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[121] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[122] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[123]\n\n\nLater the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies.[124] The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona celebrating their 2011 FIFA Club World Cup win against Santos FC\nIn December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[126] As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16.[127][128] Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”,[21] their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[129]\n\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[130][131] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[132][133] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[134]\n\n\nIt was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager.[135] Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[136] They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[137]\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Bartomeu era[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[138] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals.[139] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar.[140] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.[141]\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Suárez joined the club in 2014. Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", formed a record-breaking strike force.\nBarcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[142] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[143] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[144] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[145] On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[146] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[147]\n\n\nOn 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[148] The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[149][150] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[151] On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[152][153] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[154][155] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[156] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons.[157] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neymar preparing to take a free kick in Barcelona's comeback against Paris Saint-Germain\nOn 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[159] On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor.[160] On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\".[161] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[162] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played.[163] Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[164] On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.[165] However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.[166]\n\n\nOn 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[167] Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[168] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[169] Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of Barcelona's league performance 1929–2023\nOn 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[172] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[173] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain.[174][175] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.[176]\n\n\nPoor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[177][178] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[179] In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[180]\n\n\nOn 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[181]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2023, Spanish prosecutors said they had filed a complaint against Barcelona and two of the La Liga club's ex-presidents over alleged payments to a company owned by a senior refereeing official to influence match results.[182] On 23 March 2023, UEFA said it had opened an investigation into the club for a potential violation of the European soccer governing body's legal framework regarding payments made by the club to a company owned by a senior refereeing official.[183] Four months later, UEFA announced that it temporarily accepted the club's participation in UEFA competitions, reserving the possibility of taking future measures depending on the evolution of the case, which came to be known as the Negreira case. UEFA obligated FC Barcelona to keep informed of the progress of the ongoing investigations proactively and to provide all the documents and information they request.[184][185]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supporters of FC Barcelona\n\n![](image)Tifo at the Camp Nou in a 2013 comeback against AC Milan.\nThe nickname *culer* for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan *cul* (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their *culs* over the stand.[186][187] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[188] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[189] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[190] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[191][192] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called *socis*.[193]\n\n\nIn addition to membership, as of March 2022[update] there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called *penyes*, around the world.[194] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[195] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2021[update], only behind Real Madrid with 111 million.[11][196] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## Club rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### *El Clásico*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Clásico\n\n![](image)Players jostle in Barcelona's 2–6 win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 2009 *El Clásico*.\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (*El Clásico*). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[199] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[200]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona fans creating a mosaic of the Catalan flag before a 2012 *El Clasico* at the Camp Nou\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[201][202] In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the *Coup d'état* against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops[203] (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).[201] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto *Més que un club* (*English: More than a club*) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[204]\n\n\nThere's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its *royal* name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed *CF Barcelona* succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[205] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.[206][207]\n\n\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to *Los Blancos*, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[208]\n\n\nDi Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[209] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[210] An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[211]\n\n\n\n### *El derbi Barceloní*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Derbi Barceloní\n\n![](image)Barcelona players parade La Liga trophy around the Camp Nou in May 2006 after defeating Espanyol in their last home game of the season.\nBarça's local rival has always been Espanyol. *Blanc-i-blaus*, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[212] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[213] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[214][215]\n\n\nTraditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[216] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[217]\n\n\nIn 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[212] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the *derbi* has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[212]\n\n\nThough it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[218]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry with AC Milan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona's ultras *Boixos Nois* in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League semi-final against AC Milan at San Siro\nOne of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan.[219][220][221][222] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26).[223][224][225] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[226] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.[227]\n\n\nBarcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[228] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[229][230] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at the Camp Nou.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Ownership and finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Civil Guards at the *socis*' entrance of the Camp de la Indústria\nAlong with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association.[233][234] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[235] The members of Barcelona, called *socis*, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[236] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 *socis*.[193]\n\n\nIn 2010, *Forbes* evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[237][238] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[239] In 2013, *Forbes* magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[240] In 2014, *Forbes* ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[241][242] In 2017, *Forbes* ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion.[243] In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues.[244] In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.[245][246] However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.[244]\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of FC Barcelona records and statistics\n\n![](image)Xavi made 767 total appearances for Barcelona, a former club record.\nIn March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.[247]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi is Barcelona's all-time top appearance maker, top scorer, and the highest scoring player for a single club.\nBarcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez's 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years.[248] In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé’s 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club.[249] Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions,[250] and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga.[251] Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108).[252] Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 64 goals.[253]\n\n\nLászló Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952.[254] Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.[255] Eulogio Martínez became Barça's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.[250]\n\n\nBarcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[256] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[257] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.[258][259]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pep Guardiola is Barcelona's most successful coach, with 14 trophies.\nBarcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andrés Iniesta, with 32 trophies.[260]\n\n\nBarcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[261] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[262]\n\n\n*El Barça de les Cinc Copes* is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[263][264][265] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[266][267] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple).[268][269] In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history.[270][271] In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.[272][273]\n\n\nIn 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.[274]\n\n\n\n## Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to FC Barcelona kits.\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe first crest (left) worn by Barça from 1899 to 1910, and second crest (right), designed by Carles Comamala in 1910\n\nThe club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[31] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[275] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[276]\n\n\nThe blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[277] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[278][279]\n\n\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[280][281]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n1899–1910 [n1 1]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n1910–present [n1 2]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2015–16 [n1 3]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2019–20 [n1 4]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2021–22 [n1 5]\n |\n\n\nNotes\n1. **^** The first kit worn by the club in 1899.[282] In the 1999–2000 season, a similar model was worn to commemorate the 100th. anniversary of the club.[283]\n2. **^** Traditional Barcelona uniform.[284]\n3. **^** The club used horizontal stripes during the 2015–16 season.[285]\n4. **^** The club used a checkered design during the 2019–20 season.[286]\n5. **^** The club used halved shorts and a crest-inspired shirt during the 2021–22 season.[287]\n\n### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nike has been Barcelona's official kit supplier since 1998.\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt main sponsor\n | Shirt sub sponsor(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1899–1982\n | *None* | *None* | *None* |\n| 1982–1992\n | Meyba |\n| 1992–1998\n | Kappa |\n| 1998–2003\n | Nike |\n| 2003–2004\n | Forum[288] (left sleeve)\n |\n| 2004–2006\n | TV3 (left sleeve)\n |\n| 2006–2011\n | UNICEF |\n| 2011–2013\n | Qatar Foundation | TV3 (left sleeve) & UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2013–2014\n | Qatar Airways(€33,5m/year) [289][290] | UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2014–2017\n | Beko (left sleeve) & UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2017–2021\n | Rakuten(€55m/year) [291][292][293] |\n| 2021–2022\n | UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2022–2023\n | Spotify | UNHCR (back shirt)\n |\n| 2023–\n | AMBILIGHT TV (left sleeve) & UNHCR (back shirt)\n |\n\n\n## Anthems[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cant del Barça\n\nThroughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is El Cant del Barça (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.[294][295]\n\n\nThe song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at the Camp Nou stadium before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at the Camp Nou stadium. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys.\n\n\nEl Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at the Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory.\n\n\n\n## Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Camp de la Indústria, Camp de Les Corts, and Camp Nou\n\n![](image)Camp de Les Corts in 1939. It was the home stadium for Barcelona until the club moved to the Camp Nou in 1957.\nBarcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[296]\n\n\nIn 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[297]\n\n\nAfter the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[297][298][299] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[297] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.[297]\n\n\n\n![The words \"Més que un club\" are painted in yellow on the blue seats of the stadium](image)One of the Camp Nou stands displays Barcelona's motto, *\"Més que un club\"*, meaning 'More than a club'.\nIn 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.[300][301][302] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[303] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[304]\n\n\nIn December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the *Espai Barça* project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history.[305] Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding.[306][307][308] During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023–24 season to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.[309]\n\n\nThere are also other facilities, which include:[310]\n\n\n\n* Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper (FC Barcelona's training ground)\n* Masia-Centre de Formació Oriol Tort (Residence of young players)\n* Estadi Johan Cruyff (Home of the reserve team, women's team, and Juvenil A)\n* Palau Blaugrana (FC Barcelona indoor sports arena)\n* Palau Blaugrana 2 (Secondary indoor arena of FC Barcelona)\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona records and statistics, FC Barcelona in international football competitions, and List of FC Barcelona seasons\n\n\n\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | La Liga[311] | 27\n | 1929, 1944–45, 1947–48, 1948–49, 1951–52, 1952–53, 1958–59, 1959–60, 1973–74, 1984–85, 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1997–98, 1998–99, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2022–23 |\n| Copa del Rey[311] | **31** | 1910, 1912, 1913, 1920, 1922, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1942, 1951, 1952, 1952–53, 1957, 1958–59, 1962–63, 1967–68, 1970–71, 1977–78, 1980–81, 1982–83, 1987–88, 1989–90, 1996–97, 1997–98, 2008–09, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2020–21 |\n| Supercopa de España[311] | **14** | 1983, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018, 2022–23 |\n| Copa Eva Duarte[311] | **3** | 1948, 1952, 1953 |\n| Copa de la Liga[311] | **2** | 1983, 1986 |\n| **Continental** | UEFA Champions League[311] | 5\n | 1991–92, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15 |\n| UEFA Cup Winners' Cup[311] | **4** | 1978–79, 1981–82, 1988–89, 1996–97 |\n| UEFA Super Cup[311] | **5**S | 1992, 1997, 2009, 2011, 2015 |\n| Inter-Cities Fairs Cup[311] | **3** | 1955–58, 1958–60, 1965–66 |\n| Latin Cup[311] | **2**S | 1949, 1952 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup[311] | 3\n | 2009, 2011, 2015 |\n| **Regional** | Catalan football championship[311] | **23** | 1901–02, 1902–03, 1904–05, 1908–09, 1909–10, 1910–11, 1912–13, 1915–16, 1918–19, 1919–20, 1920–21, 1921–22, 1923–24, 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27, 1927–28, 1929–30, 1930–31, 1931–32, 1933–34, 1935–36, 1937–38 |\n| Copa Catalunya[311] | **8** | 1990–91, 1992–93, 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2004–05, 2006–07, 2012–13, 2013–14 |\n| Supercopa de Catalunya[311] | **2** | 2014, 2018\n |\n\n\n* Record\n* S Shared record\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of FC Barcelona players\n\nFor a list of all former and current FC Barcelona players with a Wikipedia article, see Category:FC Barcelona players.\n\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship.

V.** (**FCB**, pronounced [ˈfuːsbalˌklʊp ˈbaɪɐn ˈmʏnçn̩] ⓘ), also known as **FC Bayern** (pronounced [ˌɛft͡seː ˈbaɪɐn] ⓘ), **Bayern Munich**, or simply **Bayern**, is a German professional sports club based in Munich, Bavaria. It is best known for its professional men's association football team, which plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Bayern is the most successful club in German football history, having won a record 33 national titles, including 11 consecutively since 2013, and 20 national cups, along with numerous European honours.\n\n\nFC Bayern Munich was founded in 1900 by 11 football players, led by Franz John.[4] Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, they won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of the Treble, after which it became the second European club to achieve the feat twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally, and the only German club to have won both international titles. Bayern players have accumulated five Ballon d'Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, four European Golden Shoe and three UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards, including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\n\n\nBy winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the \"sextuple\" (winning the League, Cup, and Champions League in one season followed by the Domestic Supercup, UEFA Supercup and Club World Cup in the next season), or all trophies that a club competes for in a given calendar year. Bayern Munich are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, the only German club to achieve that. As of May 2023, Bayern Munich are ranked second in UEFA club rankings. The club has traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg.\n\n\nSince the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously, the team had played at Munich's Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white, and the crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria. In terms of revenue, Bayern Munich is the largest sports club in Germany and the third highest-earning football club in the world, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, with a value of €634.1 million in 2021.[5] In August 2023, Bayern had more than 300,000 official members and 4,557 officially registered fan clubs, with over 362,000 members. The club has other departments for chess, handball, basketball, gymnastics, bowling, table tennis and senior football, with more than 1,100 active members.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of FC Bayern Munich\n\n### Early years (1900s–1960s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first game of FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Nürnberg in 1901\nFC Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association (DFB), 11 members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against FC Nordstern,[7] and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 South German championship.[4] In the following years, the club won some local trophies and in 1910–11 Bayern joined the newly founded \"Kreisliga\", the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of the First World War in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.[8][9] By the end of its first decade of founding, Bayern had attracted its first German national team player, Max *Gaberl* Gablonsky.[10] By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.[10]\n\n\nIn the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later.[8][11] Its first national title was gained in 1932, when coach Richard \"Little Dombi\" Kohn led the team to the German championship by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2–0 in the final.[8]\n\n\nThe rise of Adolf Hitler to power put an abrupt end to Bayern's development. Club president Kurt Landauer and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the \"Jew's club\" while local rival 1860 Munich gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated in 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. After a friendly match in Switzerland, some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was a spectator, and the club was subject to continued discrimination.[12] Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again, which led to the move of the gifted young centre-forward Oskar Rohr to Switzerland. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.[13]\n\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War in 1945, Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd, the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern ultras *Schickeria*.[14][15] In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the *Oberliga* in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final.[16][17]\n\n\nThe club struggled financially, though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. Manufacturer ousted president Reitlinger, who was later convicted for financial irregularities, was ousted in the elections of 1958 by the industrialist Roland Endler. He provided financial stability for the club. Under his reign, Bayern had its best years in the Oberliga.[18] Endler was no longer a candidate in 1962, when Wilhelm Neudecker, who became wealthy in the postwar construction boom, replaced him.\n\n\nIn 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. The key to qualifying for the Bundesliga was the accumulated record of the last twelve years, where Bayern was only the sixth-ranked club. To boot, local rivals TSV 1860 Munich, ranked seventh, were champions of the last Oberliga-Süd season and were given preference on the basis of this achievement.[19][20] After initial protests by Bayern for alleged mistreatment remained fruitless, president Neudecker rose to the challenge and hired Zlatko Čajkovski, who in 1962 led 1. FC Köln to the national championship. Fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier – who would later be collectively referred to as *the axis*, they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965.[17]\n\n\n\n### The golden years (1960s–1970s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gerd Müller\n![](image)Franz Beckenbauer and Roberto Perfumo before a friendly v Argentina in 1970\nIn their first Bundesliga season, Bayern finished third and also won the DFB-Pokal. This qualified them for the following year's European Cup Winners' Cup, which they won in a dramatic final against Scottish club Rangers, when Franz Roth scored the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory.[17] In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal, but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln and Werder Bremen. Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season.[21]\n\n\nUdo Lattek took charge in 1970. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship. The deciding match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion, and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1 and thus claimed the title, also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored.[22] Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay.[23] This title – after winning the Cup Winners' trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (1968 and 1972) in that competition – marked the club's breakthrough as a force on the international stage.\n\n\n\n![](image)FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Magdeburg in 1974\nDuring the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. \"We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners, but we were very, very lucky\", stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was \"very suspicious\". Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years.[24] A year later in Glasgow, Saint-Étienne were defeated by another Roth goal and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs.[25] The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers.[26] *Bayerndusel* was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.\n\n\n\n### From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1970s–1990s)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed *FC Breitnigge*, led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired, and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in 1982 and 1987.[27]\n\n\nJupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90, Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in 1990–91, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In 1993–94, Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City, who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion.[28] Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.[29]\n\n\nHis successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club's high expectations.[30] During this time, Bayern's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname *FC Hollywood*.[31] Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final.[32] For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Renewed international success (1990s–2000s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Allianz Arena, opened in 2005, is one of the world's most modern football stadiums.\nAfter his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld's first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came close to winning the Champions League, losing 2–1 to Manchester United into injury time after leading for most of the match.[35] The following year, in the club's centenary season, Bayern won the third league and cup double in its history. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal on the final day of the league season.[36][37] Days later, Bayern won the Champions League for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating Valencia on penalties.[38] The 2001–02 season began with a win in the Intercontinental Cup,[39] but ended trophyless otherwise. In 2002–03, Bayern won their fourth double, leading the league by a record margin of 16 points.[40] Hitzfeld's reign ended in 2004, with Bayern underperforming, including defeat by second division Alemannia Aachen in the DFB-Pokal.[41]\n\n\nFelix Magath took over and led Bayern to two consecutive doubles. Prior to the start of the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shared with 1860 Munich.[42] On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.[43]\n\n\nHitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the 2006–07 season in fourth position, thus failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the DFB-Pokal and the DFB-Ligapokal left the club with no honours for the season.\n\n\n\n### Robbery – Robben and Ribery (2000s 2010s)[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild. They signed a total of eight new players and sold, released or loaned out nine of their players.[44] Among new signings were 2006 World Cup stars such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern went on to win the Bundesliga in convincing fashion, leading the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.[45]\n\n\nAfter the season, Bayern's long-term goalkeeper Oliver Kahn retired, which left the club without a top-tier goalkeeper for several seasons.[46] The club's coach Ottmar Hitzfeld also retired and Jürgen Klinsmann was chosen as his successor.[47] However, Klinsmann was sacked even before the end of his first season as Bayern trailed Wolfsburg in the league, had lost the quarterfinal of the DFB-Pokal to Bayer Leverkusen, and had been made look silly in the quarterfinal of the Champions League when FC Barcelona scored four times in the first half of the first leg and over the course of both legs Bayern never looked like they could keep up. Jupp Heynckes was named caretaker coach and led the club to a second-place finish in the league.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bayern Munich playing against Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga in September 2011\nFor the 2009–10 season, Bayern hired Dutch manager Louis van Gaal,[49] and Dutch forward Arjen Robben joined Bayern.[50] Robben, alongside Ribéry, would go on to shape Bayern's playstyle of attacking over the wings for the next ten years. The press quickly dubbed the duo \"Robbery\". In addition, David Alaba and Thomas Müller were promoted to the first team. With Müller, van Gaal went so far as to proclaim, \"With me, Müller always plays,\" which has become a much-referenced phrase over the years.[51] On the pitch Bayern had its most successful season since 2001, securing the domestic double[52] and losing only in the final of the Champions League to Inter Milan 0–2.[53] Despite the successful 2009–10 campaign, van Gaal was fired in April 2011 as Bayern was trailing in the league and eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League, again by Inter. Van Gaal's second in command, Andries Jonker, took over and finished the season in third place.[54]\n\n\nJupp Heynckes returned for his second permanent spell in the 2011–12 season. Although the club had signed Manuel Neuer, ending Bayern's quest for an adequate substitute for Kahn, and Jérôme Boateng for the season, Bayern remained without a title for the second consecutive season, coming in second to Borussia Dortmund in the league and the cup.[55] The Champions League final was held at the Allianz and Bayern indeed reached the final in their home stadium but lost the \"Finale dahoam\" as they had termed it to Chelsea on penalties.[56] For the 2012–13 season, Bayern signed Javi Martínez.[57] After Bayern had finished as runner-up to all titles in 2011–12, Bayern went on to win all titles in 2012–13, setting various Bundesliga records along the way,[58] and becoming the first German team to win the treble. Bayern finished the Bundesliga on 91 points, only 11 points shy of a perfect season, and to date, still, the best season ever played. In what was Bayern's third Champions League final appearance within four years, they beat Borussia Dortmund 2–1.[59] A week later, they completed the treble by winning the DFB-Pokal final over VfB Stuttgart.[60] During the season, in January, Bayern had already announced that they would hire Pep Guardiola as coach for the 2013–14 season. Originally the club presented this as Heynckes retiring on the expiration of his contract, but Uli Hoeneß later admitted that it was not Heynckes's decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season. It was actually forced by the club's desire to appoint Guardiola.[61]\n\n\nBayern fulfilled Guardiola's wish of signing Thiago Alcântara from FC Barcelona,[62] and Guardiola's first season started off well with Bayern extending a streak of undefeated league matches from the last season to 53 matches. The eventual loss to Augsburg came two match days after Bayern had already claimed the league title.[63] During the season, Bayern had also claimed two other titles, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup,[64][65] the latter being the last major trophy the club had not yet won. Bayern also won the cup to complete their tenth domestic double,[66] but lost in the semi-final of the Champions League to Real Madrid.[67] Off the pitch, Bayern's president Uli Hoeneß was convicted of tax evasion on 13 March 2014 and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Hoeneß resigned the next day.[68] Vice-president Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 May. Before the 2014–15 season, Bayern picked up Robert Lewandowski after his contract had ended at Borussia Dortmund,[69] and loaned out Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid.[70] Bayern also let Toni Kroos leave for Real.[71] Club icons Bastian Schweinsteiger and Claudio Pizarro left before the 2015–16 season.[72][73] In these two seasons, Bayern defended their league title, including another double in 2015–16,[74] but failed to advance past the semi-finals in the Champions League. Although the club's leadership tried to convince Guardiola to stay, the coach decided not to extend his three-year contract.[75]\n\n\nCarlo Ancelotti was hired as successor to Guardiola.[76] The key transfer for the 2016–17 campaign was Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund.[77] Off the pitch Uli Hoeneß had been released early from prison and reelected as president in November 2016.[78] Under Ancelotti, Bayern claimed their fifth consecutive league title,[79] but did not win the cup or the Champions League. In July 2017, Bayern announced that 1860 Munich would leave the Allianz for good as the club had been relegated to the 4th division.[80] Before the 2017–18 season, Bayern made extensive changes to their squad, signing amongst others young prospects such as Kingsley Coman, Corentin Tolisso, Serge Gnabry and Niklas Süle, and loaning James Rodríguez from Real. Meanwhile, the club's captain, Philipp Lahm, and Xabi Alonso retired, and several other players left the club.[81] As Bayern's performances were perceived to be increasingly lacklustre, Ancelotti was sacked after a 0–3 loss to Paris St. Germain in the Champions League, early in his second season.[82] Willy Sagnol took over as interim manager for a week before it was announced that Jupp Heynckes would finish the season in his fourth spell at the club.[83] During the season, the club urged Heynckes —even publicly— to extend his contract, but Heynckes, aged 73, stayed firm that he would retire for good after the season.[84] The club began a long and extensive search to find a replacement, and eventually Niko Kovač was presented as Heynckes's successor, signing a three-year contract.[85] Heynckes led the club to another championship. In the cup final, Heynckes's last match as coach, Heynckes met his successor on the pitch. Kovač's Eintracht Frankfurt denied Bayern the title, winning 3–1.[86]\n\n\nKovač's first season at the club started slowly, with Bayern falling behind Dortmund in the league throughout the first half of the season. In contrast to similar situations with van Gaal and Ancelotti, the club's leadership decided to protect their coach from criticisms.[87] However, after the winter break, Bayern quickly closed the distance and put themselves first-place in the league. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated by Liverpool in the round of 16, the first time since 2011 that Bayern did not reach the quarterfinal.[88] During the season Arjen Robben announced that it would be his last season for the club,[89] while Uli Hoeneß announced that Franck Ribéry would be leaving at the end of the season.[90] In March 2019, Bayern announced that they had signed Lucas Hernandez from Atlético Madrid for a club and Bundesliga record fee of €80 million.[91][92] On 18 May 2019, Bayern won their seventh straight Bundesliga title as they finished two points above second-place Dortmund with 78 points. This Bundesliga title was Ribéry's ninth and Robben's eighth.[93] A week later, Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final. With the win, Bayern won their 19th German Cup and completed their 12th domestic double.[94]\n\n\n\n### German coaches era (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### Flick era (2010s–2020s)[edit]\n\n\nHansi Flick joined Bayern Munich on 1 July 2019 as an assistant coach.[95] Under Kovač, Bayern was off to a slow start in the league and after a 5–1 loss to Frankfurt, Kovač and Bayern parted ways on 3 November 2019 with Flick being promoted to interim manager.[96][97] After a satisfying spell as interim coach, Bayern announced on 22 December 2019 that Flick would remain in charge until the end of season.[98] Bayern's performances on the pitch picked up noticeably and in April 2020, the club agreed with Flick to a new permanent contract through 2023.[99] Under Flick the club won the league, having played the most successful leg of a Bundesliga season in history,[100] and went on to claim the cup, thus completing the club's 13th domestic double.[101] In the Champions League, Bayern reached their first final since 2013, en route beating FC Barcelona 8–2 in the quarter-finals[102] and Lyon 3–0 in the semi-final.[103] In the final, which was held in Lisbon behind closed doors due to the severity of COVID-19 pandemic, they defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0. Former PSG player Kingsley Coman scored the only goal of the match.[104] With the victory, they became the second European club to complete the seasonal treble in two different seasons, matching the 2014–15 FC Barcelona team.[105]\n\n\nAfter a short break, Bayern started the new season by winning the UEFA Super Cup for the second time in their history. In a closely contested match, Bayern defeated Sevilla 2–1 after extra time, with Javi Martínez scoring the winning goal.[106] On 30 September 2020, they won the 2020 DFL-Supercup after defeating the runners-up of the Bundesliga Dortmund 3–2.[107] In February 2021, they won the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup (postponed from December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) after defeating African champions Al Ahly SC 2–0 by a brace from Robert Lewandowski,[108] and then winning in the final against Mexican team Tigres UANL 1–0 after a goal from Benjamin Pavard and became only the second club to win the sextuple, after Barcelona won it in 2009.[109] Later, Bayern failed to defend its Champions League title, losing to PSG in the quarter-finals on away goals following a 3–3 aggregate draw.[110] However, it managed to win its 9th Bundesliga title in a row.[111] During the season, Robert Lewandowski broke Gerd Müller's record for the number of goals scored in a Bundesliga season after scoring 41 times.[112]\n\n\nOn 27 April 2021, Bayern announced that Flick would be leaving at the end of the season, at his request, and that RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann would become the new manager, effective 1 July.[113] According to multiple reports, Bayern paid Leipzig €25m, a world record for a manager, as compensation for Nagelsmann's services.[114] It was later announced that Flick was leaving to take charge of the German national team of which he had previously been the assistant coach under manager Joachim Löw.[115]\n\n\n\n#### Nagelsmann era (2020s)[edit]\n\n\nUnder new coach Julian Nagelsmann, Bayern have completed the feat of winning 10 consecutive Bundesliga titles following a 3–1 Der Klassiker win.[116] However, the team unexpectedly lost to Villarreal in the Champions League quarter-finals, going out at that stage for the second year in a row.[117] On 24 March 2023, Nagelsmann was released by Bayern and replaced by Thomas Tuchel, who received a contract until 30 June 2025.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Tuchel era (2020s–present)[edit]\n\n\nOn 25 March 2023, Thomas Tuchel was presented at a press conference as the new Bayern manager.[119] With Tuchel in charge, Bayern was immediately eliminated from the DFB-Pokal in the quarter-finals by SC Freiburg,[120] and also in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Manchester City F.C.[121] However, he led them to a record 11th consecutive title by beating 1. FC Köln and winning a close title race with Borussia Dortmund.[122] Oliver Kahn and Hasan Salihamidzic were both dismissed after the club secured the Bundesliga title. Jan-Christian Dreesen replaced Kahn as CEO with a new sporting director yet to be announced.[123] Bayern appointed Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as member of the FC Bayern München AG supervisory board at their regular meeting on 30 May 2023.[124] Bayern Munich have appointed Christoph Freund as the club's new sporting director from 1 September.[125]\n\n\nOn 12 August 2023, Bayern broke the German transfer record again, this time to sign England's captain and all-time leading goalscorer Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of €110m.[126]\n\n\n\n## Kits[edit]\n\n\nIn the original club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905 when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which were meant as an insult.[4] For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all-red home kit with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.[127] Bayern also wore a *Rotwein* coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first-choice colours prior to the late 1960s.[128]\n\n\nThe club's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the 2013–14 season, Bayern used an all-red home kit with a Bavarian flag diamond watermark pattern, a *Lederhosen* inspired white and black *Oktoberfest* away kit, and an all navy blue international kit.[129]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at 1.

Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954.[127] The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for *Fußball-Abteilung*, i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.\n\n\nThe modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.[127] While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.\n\n\n\nBayern Munich logo history\n* ![1901](image)\n\n1901\n* ![1902–1906](image)\n\n1902–1906\n* ![1906–1919](image)\n\n1906–1919\n* ![1919–1924](image)\n\n1919–1924\n* ![1925–1954[a]](image)\n\n1925–1954[a]\n* ![1954–1996](image)\n\n1954–1996\n* ![1996–2002](image)\n\n1996–2002\n* ![2002–2017](image)\n\n2002–2017\n* ![2017–](image)\n\n2017–\n\n## Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Bayern's first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924\nBayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße.[135] As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.[136]\n\n\nFrom 1925, Bayern shared the Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich.[137] Until World War II, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as *Sechz'ger* (\"Sixties\") Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season.[138] In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.[139][140]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Olympiastadion, home of Bayern Munich from 1972 to 2005\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics, the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion. The stadium, renowned for its architecture,[141] was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971–72 season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. In its early days, the stadium was considered one of the foremost stadiums in the world and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of 1974 FIFA World Cup.[142] In the following years the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 per cent to 66 per cent.[*clarification needed*] Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect Günther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium.[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena is lit in red for Bayern home games.\nAfter much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005–06 season.[143] Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio.[144] Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000.[145] In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).[146]\n\n\nThe stadium's most prominent feature is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colors for impressive effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for German national team home games.[147]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.[148]\n\n\n\n## Supporters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A part of the \"Südkurve\" – the usual spot of the ultra-scene at Allianz Arena\nAt the 2018 annual general meeting, the Bayern board reported that the club had 291,000 official members and there are 4,433 officially registered fan clubs with over 390,000 members.[149] This makes the club the largest fan membership club in the world.[150] Bayern have fan clubs and supporters all over Germany. Fan club members from all over Germany and nearby Austria and Switzerland often travel more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) to Munich to attend home games at the Allianz Arena.[151] Bayern has an average of 75,000 attendees at the Allianz Arena which is at 100 per cent capacity level. Every Bundesliga game has been sold-out for years.[152] Bayern's away games have been sold out for many years.[153] According to a study by Sport+Markt Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, and the most popular football club in Germany with 10 million supporters.[154]\n\n\nBayern Munich is also renowned for its well-organised ultra scene. The most prominent groups are the *Schickeria München*, the *Inferno Bavaria*, the *Red Munichs '89*, the *Südkurve '73*, the *Munichmaniacs 1996*, the *Red Angels*, and the *Red Sharks*. The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognised for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, racism and homophobia,[155][156][157] and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.[158][159][160][161]\n\n\nFC Bayern Munich are the world's largest football club in terms of members. The Red Ladies are Bayern Munich's first and only international all-female supporter club with over 200 members.[162] They are known for being super fans and creating a safe community for women to talk about the club.[163]\n\n\nStern des Südens is the song which fans sing at FCB home games. In the 1990s they also used to sing *FC Bayern, Forever Number One*.[164] Another notable song is *Mia San Mia*[b] (Bavarian for \"we are who we are\") which is a famous motto of the club as well.[166] A renowned catchphrase for the team is \"*Packmas*\" which is a Bavarian phrase for the German \"*Packen wir es*\", which means \"let's do it\".[167] The team's mascot is called \"Berni\" since 2004.[168]\n\n\nThe club also has a number of high-profile supporters, among them Pope Benedict XVI,[169] Boris Becker, Wladimir Klitschko, Horst Seehofer and Edmund Stoiber, former Minister-President of Bavaria.[170]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bavarian football derbies, Munich derby, and Der Klassiker\n\n![](image)A Munich derby match at the Allianz Arena between Bayern and 1860 Munich in the quarter-final of the 2007–08 DFB-Pokal on 27 February 2008\nBayern is one of three professional football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who was the more successful club in the 1950s and was controversially picked for the initial Bundesliga season in 1963, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting much extra attention from supporters of both clubs.[171] Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.[172]\n\n\nSince the 1920s, 1. FC Nürnberg has been Bayern's main and traditional[173] rival in Bavaria. Philipp Lahm said that playing Nürnberg is \"always special\" and is a \"heated atmosphere\".[173] Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, Nürnberg was far more successful, winning five championships in the 1920s, making the club Germany's record champion. Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later, when they won their tenth championship in 1987, thereby surpassing the number of championships won by Nürnberg.[173][174] The duel between Bayern and Nürnberg is often referred to as the Bavarian Derby.\n\n\nBayern also enjoys a strong rivalry with the 1. FC Kaiserslautern, originating in parts from a game in 1973, when Bayern lost 7–4 after leading 4–1,[175][176] but also from the two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga as well as the city of Kaiserslautern together with the surrounding Palatinate having been part of Bavaria until a plebiscite after the end of the Second World War.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bayern Munich won 2–1 against Borussia Dortmund to win the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League on 25 May 2013.\nSince the 1970s, Bayern's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. In the 1970s this was Borussia Mönchengladbach,[23] in the 1980s the category expanded to include Hamburger SV. In the 1990s, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen[177][178] emerged as the most ardent opponents. Recently Borussia Dortmund, Schalke,[179] and Werder Bremen have been the main challengers in the Bundesliga. Recently, Bayern's main Bundesliga challenger has been Borussia Dortmund.[180] Bayern and Dortmund have competed against each other for many Bundesliga titles. They also have played against each other in the DFB-Pokal final in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2016. The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a DFB-Pokal final. Bayern and Dortmund have also played against each other in the DFL-Supercup in 1989, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The height of the competition between the two clubs was when Bayern defeated Dortmund 2–1 in the final of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League.\n\n\nAmongst Bayern's chief European rivals are Real Madrid,[181] A.C. Milan,[182] and Manchester United due to many classic wins, draws and losses.[177] Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches. Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"*Bestia negra*\" (\"Black Beast\"). Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup.\n\n\n\n## Organization and finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bayern's former president from 1994 to 2009 and former player Franz Beckenbauer\nSee also: Most valuable sports teams\n\nBayern is led mostly by former club players. From 2016 to 2019, Uli Hoeneß served as the club's president, following Karl Hopfner who had been in office from 2014; Hoeneß had resigned in 2014 after being convicted of tax fraud.[183][184] Oliver Kahn was the chairman of the executive board of the AG.[185] The supervisory board of nine consists mostly of managers of big German corporations. Besides the club's president and the board's chairman, they are Herbert Hainer former CEO of (Adidas), Dr. Herbert Diess chairman of (Volkswagen), Dr. Werner Zedelius senior advisor at (Allianz), Timotheus Höttges CEO of (Deutsche Telekom), Prof. Dr. Dieter Mayer, Edmund Stoiber, Theodor Weimer CEO of (Deutsche Börse), and Dr. Michael Diederich speaker of the board at (UniCredit Bank).[186][187]\n\n\nProfessional football at Bayern is run by the spin-off organisation *FC Bayern München AG*. *AG* is short for *Aktiengesellschaft*, and Bayern is run like a joint stock company, a company whose stock are not listed on the public stock exchange, but is privately owned. 75 per cent of *FC Bayern München AG* is owned by the club, the *FC Bayern München e. V.* (*e. V.* is short for *Eingetragener Verein*, which translates into \"Registered Club\"). Three German corporations, the sports goods manufacturer Adidas, the automobile company Audi and the financial services group Allianz each hold 8.33 per cent of the shares, 25 per cent in total.[185] Adidas acquired its shares in 2002 for €77 million. The money was designated to help finance the Allianz Arena.[188] In 2009 Audi paid €90 million for their share. The capital was used to repay the loan on the Allianz Arena.[189] And in early 2014, Allianz became the third shareholder of the company acquiring theirs share for €110 million. With the sale, Bayern paid off the remaining debt on the Allianz Arena 16 years ahead of schedule.[190] Bayern's other sports departments are run by the club.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bayern Munich team bus provided by sponsor MAN\nBayern's shirt sponsor is Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has been Bayern's shirt sponsor since the start of 2002–03 season. The company extended their sponsorship deal in August 2015 until the end of the 2026–27 season.[191] Bayern's kit sponsor is Adidas. Adidas have been Bayern's kit sponsor since 1974. Adidas extended their sponsorship with Bayern on 29 April 2015. The sponsorship deal runs until the end of the 2029–30 season.[192] The premium partners are Audi, Allianz, HypoVereinsbank, Goodyear, Qatar Airways, Siemens, Paulaner Brewery, SAP, DHL, Hamad International Airport and Tipico. Gold sponsors are Coca-Cola, MAN, Procter & Gamble. Classic sponsors are Apple Music, Bayern 3, Beats Electronics, EA Sports, Gigaset, Hugo Boss, Courtyard by Marriott, Veuve Clicquot, and Adelholzener.[193] In previous years the jersey rights were held by Adidas[194] (1974–78), Magirus Deutz and Iveco[195] (1978–84), Commodore[196] (1984–89) and Opel[197] (1989–2002).\n\n\nBayern is an exception in professional football, having generated profits for 27 consecutive years.[149] Other clubs often report losses, realising transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. In the 2019 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, Bayern had the fourth-highest revenue in club football, generating revenue of €629.2 million. Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. The top 20 European football clubs earned 43 per cent of revenue, on average, from broadcasting rights. Bayern earned the only 28 per cent of their revenue that way. Bayern had the second-highest commercial revenue in the 2019 Deloitte Football Money League, behind only Real Madrid. Bayern's commercial revenue was €348.7 million (55 per cent of total revenue). In contrast, Bayern's Matchday revenue trails other top clubs at €103.8 million (17 per cent of their total revenue).[198]\n\n\nWhile other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern had focused on Germany.[199] In recent years Bayern have started to focus their marketing more on Asia and the United States. Bayern made summer tours to the United States in 2014 and 2016. Bayern went to China in the summer of 2015 and returned in the summer of 2017 where they also played games in Singapore. In August 2014 Bayern opened an office in New York City as the club wants to strengthen their brand positioning against other top European clubs in the United States.[200] In March 2017, Bayern was the first foreign football club to open an office in mainland China. Bayern hope to attract new sponsors and to increase their merchandising sales. In 2017, Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fourth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club's value at €2.5 billion.[201]\n\n\nAs a result of Bayern's appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, the club's brand value has reached US$786 million, up 59 per cent from the previous year. Among European teams, this is ahead of Real Madrid's US$600 million and behind first-placed Manchester United, whose brand is valued at US$853 million. In 2013, Bayern overtook Manchester United to take first place in brand valuation.[202]\n\n\nBayern's financial report for the 2018–19 season reported revenue of €750.4 million and an operating profit of €146.1 million. Post-tax profits were €52.5 million which meant that this was Bayern's 27th consecutive year with a profit.[149]\n\n\nIn 2022, FC Bayern announced the opening of an international office in Bangkok; marking their third such branch office.[203]\n\n\n\n## Social engagement and charity[edit]\n\n\nBayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time, helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery. In the wake of the 2004 Tsunami the \"FC Bayern – Hilfe e.V.\" was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club.[204] At its inception this venture was funded with €600,000, raised by officials and players of the club.[205] The money was amongst other things used to build a school in Marathenkerny, Sri Lanka[205] and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. In April 2007 it was decided that the focus of the foundation would shift towards supporting people in need locally.[204]\n\n\nThe club has also assisted sport clubs in financial disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers.[206] Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its licence for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli.[207] More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club.[208] Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners.[209] In 2003, Bayern provided a €2 Million loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid.[210][211][212] On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.[213] On 30 August 2017, Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled Kickers Offenbach. All the revenue from the match went to Kickers Offenbach. Bayern's chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, \"Kickers Offenbach are a club with a rich tradition, they've always been an important club in Germany, so we'll gladly help them with a benefit match.\"[214] On 27 May 2019, Bayern played a benefit match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. The match was played so Kaiserslautern could secure their licence to play in the German third division. All income from the match went to Kaiserslautern.[215] \"1. FC Kaiserslautern are one of Germany's biggest traditional clubs,\" Bayern's chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. \"For many years there were intense, and in retrospect also legendary, Bayern matches at Kaiserslautern. Football is all about emotions and sporting rivalries, but also about solidarity. That's why we're happy to help and hope 1. FC Kaiserslautern can once again gain promotion back to the Bundesliga in the foreseeable future.\"[216]\n\n\nIn mid 2013, Bayern was the first club to give financial support to the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation. The foundation researches the living environment LGBT people, and developed an education concept to facilitate unbiased dealing with LGBT themes in football.[217]\n\n\nIn 2016, FC Bayern received the Nine Values Cup, an award of the international children's social programme Football for Friendship.[218]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019/20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.[219]\n\n\n\n## Training facility[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Bayern Munich Headquarters\nFC Bayern Munich headquarters and training facility is called Säbener Straße and it is located in the Untergiesing-Harlaching borough of Munich. The first team and the reserve team train at the facility.[220] There are five grass pitches, two of which have undersoil heating, two artificial grass fields, a beach volleyball court and a multi-functional sports hall.[221]\n\n\n\n![](image)FC Bayern Football pitch (training only)\nThe players' quarters opened in 1990 and were reconstructed after the 2007–08 season on suggestions by then new coach, Jürgen Klinsmann, who took inspiration from various major sports clubs. The quarters are now called the performance centre and feature weights and fitness areas, a massage unit, dressing rooms, the coaches' office, and a conference room with screening facilities for video analysis. A café, a library, an e-Learning room, and a family room are also included.\n\n\nUntil August 2017, the Youth House was located at the headquarters at Säbener Straße. The Youth House housed up to 14 young talents aged 15 to 18 from outside of Munich. Former residents of the Youth House include Bastian Schweinsteiger, David Alaba, Owen Hargreaves, Michael Rensing, Holger Badstuber and Emre Can.\n\n\nIn 2006, Bayern purchased land near the Allianz Arena with the purpose of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started after overcoming internal resistance. The project's main reasons were that the existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at the senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at the youth level. The new facility was scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.[222] On 21 August 2017 the FC Bayern Campus opened at a cost of €70 million. The campus is located north of Munich at Ingolstädter Straße. The campus is 30 hectare and has 8 football pitches for youth teams from the U-9s to the U-19s and the women's and girls' teams. The campus also has a 2,500-capacity stadium where the U-17s and the U-19s play their matches. The Allianz FC Bayern Akademie is located on the campus site, and the academy has 35 apartments for young talents who don't live in the Greater Munich area. The academy building also has offices for youth coaches and staff.[223]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of FC Bayern Munich records and statistics § Honours\n\nBayern is historically the most successful team in German football, as they have won the most championships and the most cups. They are also Germany's most successful team in international competitions, having won fourteen trophies. Bayern is the only club to have won all three major European competitions, have won three consecutive European Cups and won the treble twice, one of which was part of the larger and more elusive \"sextuple\" (2020).\n\n\n\n![](image)The three consecutive European Cup trophies won by FC Bayern Munich from 1974 to 1976.

A sextuple consists of going \"6 for 6\" in those competitions, which Bayern accomplished in 2020.

Udo Lattek, Giovanni Trapattoni and Ottmar Hitzfeld served two terms as head coach. Franz Beckenbauer served one term as head coach and one as caretaker, while Jupp Heynckes had four separate spells as coach, including one as caretaker.[232] Lattek was the club's most successful coach, having won six Bundesliga titles, two DFB Cups and the European Cup; following closely is Ottmar Hitzfeld, who won five Bundesliga titles, two DFB Cups and the Champions League. The club's least successful coach was Søren Lerby, who won less than a third of his matches in charge and presided over the club's near-relegation in the 1991–92 campaign.\n\n\nOn 3 November 2019, Bayern sacked Niko Kovač after a 5–1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt and appointed Hansi Flick as a coach. Initially, Flick was installed as caretaker coach only, however on 15 November, after Flick's team had won 4–0 against Borussia Dortmund, Bayern announced that Flick would be in charge at least until Christmas 2019.[233] Later on, Flick signed a new contract until 2023.[99]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Coach\n | Period\n | MajorTitles\n | Domestic\n | European\n | Worldwide\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Although the talks came to nothing, the ice hockey department of Münchner Eislauf Verein decided to join Bayern –mid-season– in January 1966. The team finished the season under the name of Bayern Munich in third place of the second-tier Oberliga. The following season Bayern achieved promotion to the Bundesliga where the club stayed for two seasons. However, in 1969 the club disbanded the department and sold the hockey team to Augsburger EV, citing lack of local support and difficulty in recruiting players as reasons.[258]\n\n\n\n#### Gymnastics[edit]\n\n\nThe gymnastics department was founded in 1974 and was most successful in the 1980s. During this time, the team won four German championships in 1983, 1986, 1987, and 1988. In 2014, the division was dissolved.\n\n\n\n## Literature[edit]\n\n\n* Hüetlin, Thomas: *Gute Freunde.

The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation. \n\n\nDomestically, the club has won 19 league titles, eight FA Cups, a record nine League Cups and 16 FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, led the club to a combined 11 League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.\n\n\nLiverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world. The club has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".\n\n\nThe club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths. Most of these were Italians and Juventus fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competition, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroners inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1892–1959, 1959–85, and 1985–present\n\n![Black and white photograph of elder and bald John Houlding, wearing beard and bow tie.](image)John Houlding, the founder of Liverpool F.C.\nLiverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[3] Originally named \"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[4]\n\n\nLiverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players—the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland—so they became known as the \"team of Macs\".[5] The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.[6]\n\n\nLiverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham United centre half George Kay.[7] Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.[8] The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season.[9] Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958–59 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other \"Boot Room\" members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.[10]\n\n\n\n![Statue of a man with his arms held aloft](image)Statue of Bill Shankly outside Anfield. Shankly won promotion to the First Division and the club's first league title since 1947.\nThe club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners' Cup final.[11] Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.[12] In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.[13] During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 20 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.[14]\n\n\nPaisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.[15] Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.[16] Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence that separated the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.[17]\n\n\n\n![3 burgundy tablets with gold engraved writing. Below the tablets are flowers.](image)The Hillsborough memorial, which is engraved with the names of the 97 people who died in the Hillsborough disaster\nFagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager.[18] During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup \"Double\" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.[19] Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later, the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness, and the 97th, Andrew Devine, died of injuries sustained in the disaster in 2021.[20][21] After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.[22]\n\n\nLiverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.[23]\n\n\nDalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness.[24] Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final.[25] While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.[26] In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a \"treble\": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.[27] Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.[28] They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.[29][30]\n\n\n\n![A silver trophy with red ribbons on it](image)The European Cup, trophy won by Liverpool for a fifth time in 2005\nHoullier was replaced by Rafael Benítez at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez's first season, Liverpool won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C. Milan 3–2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 3–3.[31] The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3.[32] American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks became the owners of the club during the 2006–07 season, in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million.[33] The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan, as it had in 2005, but lost 2–1.[34] During the 2008–09 season Liverpool achieved 86 points, its then-highest Premier League points total, prior to the record-breaking 2018–19 season, and finished as runners up to Manchester United.[35]\n\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Benítez subsequently left by mutual consent[36] and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson.[37] At the start of the 2010–11 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the club's creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and of Fenway Sports Group, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010.[38] Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over.[39] In the 2011–12 season, Liverpool secured a record 8th League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final, but finished in eighth position, the worst league finish in 18 years; this led to the sacking of Dalglish.[40][41] He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers,[42] whose Liverpool team in the 2013–14 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the 1895–96 season.[43][44] Following a disappointing 2014–15 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the following campaign, Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.[45]\n\n\nRodgers was replaced by Jürgen Klopp.[46] Liverpool reached the finals of the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in Klopp's first season, finishing as runner-up in both competitions.[47] The club finished second in the 2018–19 season with 97 points (surpassing the 86 points gained during the 2008–09 season), losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side.[48] Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.[49][50] Liverpool beat Flamengo of Brazil in the final 1–0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time.[51] Liverpool then went on to win the 2019–20 Premier League, winning their first top-flight league title in thirty years.[52] The club set multiple records in the season, including winning the league with seven games remaining making it the earliest any team has ever won the title,[53] amassing a club record 99 points, and achieving a joint-record 32 wins in a top-flight season.[54]\n\n\n\n## Colours and badge[edit]\n\n\n![A blue and white shirt and white shorts](image)Liverpool's home colours worn from 1892 to 1896[55]\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Liverpool F.C. kits.\n\nFor much of Liverpool's history, its home colours have been all red. When the club was founded in 1892, blue and white quartered shirts were used until the club adopted the city's colour of red in 1896.[3] The city's symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the club's badge (or crest, as it is sometimes known) in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all-red strip.[55] Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St John recalled in his autobiography:\n\n\n\n\n> He [Shankly] thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impact – red for danger, red for power. He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats. \"Get into those shorts and let's see how you look\", he said. \"Christ, Ronnie, you look awesome, terrifying. You look 7 ft tall.\" \"Why not go the whole hog, boss?\" I suggested. \"Why not wear red socks? Let's go out all in red.\" Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born.[56]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team's home kit. Between 2012 and 2015, the kits were designed by Warrior Sports, who became the club's kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season.[57] In February 2015, Warrior's parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance.[58] The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.[59] Nike became the club's official kit supplier at the start of the 2020–21 season.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)A version of Liverpool's badge as depicted on the Shankly Gates\nLiverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor's logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 1979.[61] Since then the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints, Candy, Carlsberg and Standard Chartered. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.[62] The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club's sponsor.[63]\n\n\nThe Liverpool badge is based on the city's liver bird symbol, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1977, a red liver bird standing on a football (blazoned as \"*Statant upon a football a Liver Bird wings elevated and addorsed holding in the beak a piece of seaweed gules*\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League intended for use by Liverpool. However, Liverpool never made use of this badge.[64] In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.[65] In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.[66]\n\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Brand\n | Shirt Sponsor (chest) | Shirt Sponsor (sleeve) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1973–1979\n | Umbro | None\n | None\n |\n| 1979–1982\n | Hitachi |\n| 1982–1985\n | Crown Paints |\n| 1985–1988\n | Adidas |\n| 1988–1992\n | Candy |\n| 1992–1996\n | Carlsberg |\n| 1996–2006\n | Reebok |\n| 2006–2010\n | Adidas |\n| 2010–2012\n | Standard Chartered |\n| 2012–2015\n | Warrior |\n| 2015–2017\n | New Balance |\n| 2017–2020\n | Western Union |\n| 2020–\n | Nike | Expedia |\n\n\n## Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anfield\n\nFor information on Liverpool's abandoned proposed new stadium, see Stanley Park Stadium.\n\n![The interior of a stadium.](image)Anfield, home of Liverpool F.C.\nAnfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park.\nSituated 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre, it was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.[67] Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.[68]\n\n\nThe Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0.[69] In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.[70] The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.[71] At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadiums in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.[72]\n\n\nAnfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s, when, following recommendations from the *Taylor Report*, all clubs in the Premier League were obliged to convert to all-seater stadiums in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing its capacity to 45,276.[73] The findings of the report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.[74]\n\n\nBecause of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002.[75] Planning permission was granted in July 2004,[76] and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999-year lease on the proposed site.[77] Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with HKS, Inc. contracted to build the stadium.[78] Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300 million needed for the development.[79] In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m.[80] When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a £260 million project to improve the Anfield area. Jürgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as \"impressive.\"[81]\n\n\nIn June 2021, it was reported that Liverpool Council had given planning permission for the club to renovate and expand the Anfield Road stand, boosting the capacity by around 7,000 and taking the overall capacity at Anfield to 61,000. The expansion, which is estimated to cost £60m, was described as \"a huge milestone\" by managing director Andy Hughes, and would also see rail seating being trialled in the Kop for the 2021–22 Premier League season.[82]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\n![A single-tiered stand that contains thousands of people. Several flags are being waved. In front of the stand is a grass pitch with a goal.](image)*Kopites* in The Kop Stand\nLiverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world.[83][84] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly.[85] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours,[86] which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan, U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia.[87][88] Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield.[89] In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.[90]\n\n\nThe song \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical *Carousel* and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers, is the club's anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s.[91] It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world.[92] The song's title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club's badge.[93]\n\n\n\n![Design of the top of a set of gates, with the sky visible. The inscription on the gates reads \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".](image)The Shankly Gates, erected in honour of former manager Bill Shankly\nThe club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 people, mostly Italians and Juventus supporters, were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,[94] and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990.[95] Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial.[96] In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14 Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter;[97] half of the terms were suspended.[98]\n\n\nThe second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-seven Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days, *The Sun*'s coverage of the event spread falsehoods, particularly an article entitled \"The Truth\" that claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police.[99] Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy *The Sun* 30 years later.[100] Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.[101]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Merseyside derby and Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry\n\n![](image)Liverpool players (in grey) during their 4–1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 14 March 2009\nLiverpool's longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from Liverpool's formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield.[102] The Merseyside derby is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence has been known as the \"friendly derby\".[103] Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as \"the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League\".[104] In terms of support within the city, the number of Liverpool fans outweighs Everton supporters by a ratio of 2:1.[105]\n\n\nLiverpool's rivalry with Manchester United stems from the cities' competition in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.[106] Connected by the world's first inter-city railway, by road Liverpool and Manchester are separated by approximately 30 miles (48 km) along the East Lancs Road.[107] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by *France Football* magazine, Liverpool and Manchester United are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions, and both clubs have a global fanbase.[108][109] Viewed as one of the biggest rivalries in world football, it is considered the most famous fixture in English football.[110][111][112] The two clubs alternated as champions between 1964 and 1967,[113] and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, followed by Liverpool's four European Cup victories.[114] Despite the 39 league titles and nine European Cups between them[113] the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time – Liverpool's run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester United's 26-year title drought, and United's success in the Premier League-era likewise coincided with Liverpool's 30-year title drought,[115] and the two clubs have finished first and second in the league only five times.[113] Such is the rivalry between the clubs they rarely do transfer business with each other. The last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.[116]\n\n\n\n## Ownership and finances[edit]\n\n\nAs the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding's departure.[117] McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.[118] The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990.[119] His successor was Noel White who became chairman in 1990.[120] In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years, became chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51 percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.[121]\n\n\nMoores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The pair paid £5,000 per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club's debts.[122] Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club.[123] Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale.[124] In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion.[125] The group's creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.[126] Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.[127]\n\n\nLiverpool has been described as a global brand; a 2010 report valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £141m, an increase of £5m on the previous year. Liverpool was given a brand rating of AA (Very Strong).[128] In April 2010 business magazine *Forbes* ranked Liverpool as the sixth most valuable football team in the world, behind Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Barcelona and Bayern Munich; they valued the club at $822m (£532m), excluding debt.[129] Accountants Deloitte ranked Liverpool eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League, which ranks the world's football clubs in terms of revenue. Liverpool's income in the 2009–10 season was €225.3m.[130] According to a 2018 report by Deloitte, the club had an annual revenue of €424.2 million for the previous year,[131] and *Forbes* valued the club at $1.944 billion.[132] In 2018, annual revenue increased to €513.7 million,[133] and *Forbes* valued the club at $2.183 billion.[134] In 2019 revenue increased to €604 million (£533 million) according to Deloitte, with the club breaching the half a billion pounds mark.[135]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the owners of the club came under fire from fans and the media for deciding to furlough all non-playing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.[136] In response to this, the club made a U-turn on the decision and apologised for their initial decision.[137] In April 2021 *Forbes* valued the club at $4.1 billion, a two-year increase of 88%, making it the world's fifth-most-valuable football club.[138]\n\n\n\n\n## Liverpool in the media[edit]\n\n\nLiverpool featured in the first edition of BBC's *Match of the Day*, which screened highlights of their match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.[139] Liverpool fans featured in the Pink Floyd song \"Fearless\", in which they sang excerpts from \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".[140] To mark the club's appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released the \"Anfield Rap\", a song featuring John Barnes and other members of the squad.[141]\n\n\nA docudrama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by Jimmy McGovern, was screened in 1996. It featured Christopher Eccleston as Trevor Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.[142] Liverpool featured in the 2001 film *The 51st State*, in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.[143] The club also featured in the 1984 children's television show *Scully*, about a young boy who tries to gain a trial with Liverpool.[144] In the *Doctor Who* episode \"The Halloween Apocalypse\", aired in October 2021, features The Doctor (played by Jodie Whittaker) exiting the TARDIS outside Anfield as she exclaims: \"Liverpool?

Alex Raisbeck, who was club captain from 1899 to 1909, was the longest serving captain before being overtaken by Steven Gerrard who served 12 seasons as Liverpool captain starting from the 2003–04 season.[151] The present captain is Virgil van Dijk, who in the 2023–24 season replaced Jordan Henderson who moved to Al-Ettifaq.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Andrew Hannah | 1892–1895\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Jimmy Ross | 1895–1897\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) John McCartney | 1897–1898\n |\n| ![England](image) Harry Storer | 1898–1899\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alex Raisbeck | 1899–1909\n |\n| ![England](image) Arthur Goddard | 1909–1912\n |\n| ![England](image) Ephraim Longworth | 1912–1913\n |\n| ![England](image) Harry Lowe | 1913–1915\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Donald McKinlay | 1919–1920\n |\n| ![England](image) Ephraim Longworth | 1920–1921\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Donald McKinlay | 1921–1928\n |\n| ![England](image) Tom Bromilow | 1928–1929\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) James Jackson | 1929–1930\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Tom Morrison | 1930–1931\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Tom Bradshaw | 1931–1934\n |\n| ![England](image) Tom Cooper | 1934–1939\n |\n\n | \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Matt Busby | 1939–1940\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Willie Fagan | 1945–1947\n |\n| ![England](image) Jack Balmer | 1947–1950\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Taylor | 1950–1953\n |\n| ![England](image) Bill Jones | 1953–1954\n |\n| ![England](image) Laurie Hughes | 1954–1955\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Billy Liddell | 1955–1958\n |\n| ![England](image) Johnny Wheeler | 1958–1959\n |\n| ![England](image) Ronnie Moran | 1959–1960\n |\n| ![England](image) Dick White | 1960–1961\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Ron Yeats | 1961–1970\n |\n| ![England](image) Tommy Smith | 1970–1973\n |\n| ![England](image) Emlyn Hughes | 1973–1978\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Thompson | 1978–1981\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Graeme Souness | 1982–1984\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Neal | 1984–1985\n |\n\n | \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alan Hansen | 1985–1988\n |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Ronnie Whelan | 1988–1989\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alan Hansen | 1989–1990\n |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Ronnie Whelan | 1990–1991\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Steve Nicol | 1990–1991\n |\n| ![England](image) Mark Wright | 1991–1993\n |\n| ![Wales](image) Ian Rush | 1993–1996\n |\n| ![England](image) John Barnes | 1996–1997\n |\n| ![England](image) Paul Ince | 1997–1999\n |\n| ![England](image) Jamie Redknapp | 1999–2002\n |\n| ![Finland](image) Sami Hyypiä | 2001–2003\n |\n| ![England](image) Steven Gerrard | 2003–2015\n |\n| ![England](image) Jordan Henderson | 2015–2023\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) Virgil van Dijk | 2023–\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Player of the season[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Liverpool Player of the Season Awards\n\n## Club officials[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Owner: ![United States](image) Fenway Sports Group\n* Ambassadors: ![Wales](image) Ian Rush, ![England](image) Robbie Fowler, ![England](image) Michael Owen[152]\n\nLiverpool Football Club and Athletic Grounds Limited[edit]* Principal owner: ![United States](image) John W.

The trophies have ribbons on them and there is memorabilia next to them](image)The six European Cups Liverpool won from 1977 to 2019 on display in the club's museum\nLiverpool's first trophy was the Lancashire League, which it won in the club's first season.[5] In 1901, the club won its first League title, while the nineteenth and most recent was in 2020. Its first success in the FA Cup was in 1965. In terms of the number of trophies won, Liverpool's most successful decade was the 1980s, when the club won six League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Football League Super Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared) and two European Cups.\n\n\nThe club has accumulated more top-flight wins and points than any other English team.[159] Liverpool also has the highest average league finishing position (3.3) for the 50-year period to 2015[160] and second-highest average league finishing position for the period 1900–1999 after Arsenal, with an average league placing of 8.7.[161]\n\n\nLiverpool is the most successful British club in international football with fourteen trophies, having won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA's premier club competition, six times, an English record and only surpassed by Real Madrid and A.C. Milan. Liverpool's fifth European Cup win, in 2005, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and was also awarded a multiple-winner badge.[162][163] Liverpool also hold the English record of three wins in the UEFA Cup, UEFA's secondary club competition.[164] Liverpool also hold the English record of four wins in the UEFA Super Cup**.**[165] In 2019, the club won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, and also became the first English club to win the international treble of Club World Cup, Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.[166][167]\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool FC honours\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | First Division/Premier League[note 1] | 19\n | 1900–01, 1905–06, 1921–22, 1922–23, 1946–47, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1985–86, 1987–88, 1989–90, 2019–20 |\n| Second Division[note 1] | 4\n | 1893–94, 1895–96, 1904–05, 1961–62 |\n| FA Cup | 8\n | 1964–65, 1973–74, 1985–86, 1988–89, 1991–92, 2000–01, 2005–06, 2021–22 |\n| Football League Cup/EFL Cup | 9\n | 1980–81, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1994–95, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2011–12, 2021–22 |\n| FA Charity Shield/FA Community Shield | 16\n | 1964\\*, 1965\\*, 1966, 1974, 1976, 1977\\*, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1986\\*, 1988, 1989, 1990\\*, 2001, 2006, 2022 (\\* shared)\n |\n| Football League Super Cup | 1\n | 1985-86 |\n| **Continental** | European Cup/UEFA Champions League | 6\n | 1976–77, 1977–78, 1980–81, 1983–84, 2004–05, 2018–19 |\n| UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League | 3\n | 1972–73, 1975–76, 2000–01 |\n| UEFA Super Cup | 4\n | 1977, 2001, 2005, 2019 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup | 1\n | 2019 |\n\n\n### Minor titles[edit]\n\n\n* Lancashire League\n\t+ Winners (1): 1892–93\n* Sheriff of London Charity Shield\n\t+ Winners (1): 1906\n\n\n### Doubles and trebles[edit]\n\n\n* Doubles:[note 2]\n\t+ League and FA Cup (1): 1985–86\n\t+ League and League Cup (3): 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84\n\t+ League and European Cup (2): 1976–77, 1983–84\n\t+ League and UEFA Cup (2): 1972–73, 1975–76\n\t+ League Cup and European Cup (1): 1980–81\n\t+ FA Cup and League Cup (1): 2021–22\n\n\n* Trebles:[note 2][168]\n\t+ League, League Cup and European Cup (1): 1983–84\n\t+ FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup (1): 2000–01\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Upon its formation in 1992, the Premier League became the top tier of English football; the Football League First and Second Divisions then became the second and third tiers, respectively.

Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed *Blaugrana*.\n\n\nDomestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5][6][7] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023[update].[8][9][10] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as *El Clásico*.\n\n\nBarcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[11][12] Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[13][14] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[15]\n\n\nBarcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[16][17] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.[18] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.[19] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[20][21][22] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of FC Barcelona\n\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona seasons\n\n### 1899–1922: Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walter Wild, the club's first president (1899–1901).

Our friend and partner, Mr. Kans Kamper, from the Foot-Vall Section of the 'Sociedad Los Deportes' and former Swiss champion, wishing to organise some matches in Barcelona, requests that everyone who likes this sport contact him, come to this office Tuesday and Friday nights from 9 to 11.\"[25]\nOn 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in *Los Deportes* declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[25][26]\n\n\n\n![](image)A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903\nFC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the very first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware,[27] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.[28] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\"[29] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[30]\n\n\nOn 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[31]\n\n\nThe stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[32] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[33] Notable figures of Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru and Jack Greenwell.[34] The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[35]\n\n\nDuring the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[36] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[37]\n\n\nGamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[38] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[39]\n\n\nIn 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga and Franz Platko.[40] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.[41][30]\n\n\n\n### 1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white photo of the city from high above. Smoke from a bomb can be seen](image)The aerial bombardment of Barcelona in 1938\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[42] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Team of FC Barcelona, published on *El Gráfico*, 1926\nOn 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[43] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[44] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[30]\n\n\nAlthough they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[45] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,[41] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them.\n\n\nA month after the entire Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[46] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[47] He was dubbed the martyr of *barcelonisme*, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[48] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[49][50]\n\n\nOn 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[51][52] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to *Club de Fútbol Barcelona* and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)A prolific forward, László Kubala led Barcelona to success in the 1950s. His statue is built outside the Camp Nou.\nIn 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[55] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[56]\n\n\nDespite the difficult political situation, *CF Barcelona* enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[57] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[58] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[59]\n\n\nOn a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[60][61]\n\n\nCoach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini & Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[39]\n\n\n\n### 1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona line up against Hamburger SV before the 1960–61 European Cup semi-final\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[62][63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Suárez, the first Barcelona player to win the Ballon d'Or\nThe 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[63] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to *Futbol Club Barcelona* and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[64][65]\n\n\nThe 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[66] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[67] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[41] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[68]\n\n\n\n### 1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1979, Barcelona bought La Masia, a farmer's house built in 1702, to be a residence for young academy players. It would later play a significant role in the club's future success.[69][70]\nIn 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[71][72]\n\n\nOn 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling *blaugrana* fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)Diego Maradona's *blaugrana* shirt on display in the FC Barcelona Museum\nIn June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[74] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.[71]\n\n\nAround this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[75] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[76]\n\n\nAfter the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[71]\n\n\n\n#### The *Dream Team* era[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)As coach of the \"Dream Team\", Johan Cruyff won four consecutive league titles with Barcelona.\nIn 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\".[77] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Zubizarreta (C)**\n**Koeman**\n**Nando**\n**Ferrer**\n**Juan Carlos**\n**Eusebio**\n**Guardiola**\n**Bakero**\n**Laudrup**\n**Salinas**\n**Stoichkov**\nStarting lineup for the 1992 European Cup Final, the club's first European Cup/Champions League winning team\n\nIt was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was future Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.[79]\nUnder Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[80] Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[71] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, \"Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it.\"[81]\n\n\nReacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[82] The objective of the group, called *L'Elefant Blau*, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[82][83] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[84]\n\n\nCruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.[85] Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[86]\n\n\nLike Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.[85] However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its *centenari*, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque commemorating the centenary of FC Barcelona\nThe departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[87] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.[88][89][90]\n\n\nDespite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ronaldinho's arrival in 2003 revitalized the club.[92][93]\nAfter the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Valdés**\n**Márquez**\n**Puyol (C)**\n**Oleguer**\n**van Bronckhorst**\n**Edmílson**\n**Giuly**\n**Ronaldinho**\n**Deco**\n**van Bommel**\n**Eto'o**\nBarcelona's victorious 2006 Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[95] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[96]\n\n\nDespite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[97] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[98] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[99] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.[100]\n\n\nBarcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[101]\n\n\n\n### 2008–2012: Guardiola era[edit]\n\n\n![A man wearing long, dark blue shorts and a light blue sweatshirt under an orange bib.](image)\n![A man wearing a light blue sweatshirt and dark blue shorts.](image)\nBarcelona's midfield combination of Andrés Iniesta (left) and Xavi (right) were at the heart of Guardiola's tiki-taka passing style of play.[102]\n\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[101] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi in action during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final victory against Manchester United.\nBarça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time.[104] A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions.[105] Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[106][107][108] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[109] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[110] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[111] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[112][113]\n\n\nAfter Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he got 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[114] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[115] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[116] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[117]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in *El Clásico*.[118] At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.[119] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[120] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[121] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[122] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[123]\n\n\nLater the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies.[124] The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona celebrating their 2011 FIFA Club World Cup win against Santos FC\nIn December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[126] As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16.[127][128] Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”,[21] their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[129]\n\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[130][131] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[132][133] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[134]\n\n\nIt was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager.[135] Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[136] They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[137]\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Bartomeu era[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[138] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals.[139] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar.[140] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.[141]\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Suárez joined the club in 2014. Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", formed a record-breaking strike force.\nBarcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[142] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[143] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[144] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[145] On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[146] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[147]\n\n\nOn 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[148] The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[149][150] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[151] On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[152][153] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[154][155] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[156] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons.[157] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neymar preparing to take a free kick in Barcelona's comeback against Paris Saint-Germain\nOn 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[159] On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor.[160] On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\".[161] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[162] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played.[163] Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[164] On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.[165] However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.[166]\n\n\nOn 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[167] Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[168] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[169] Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of Barcelona's league performance 1929–2023\nOn 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[172] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[173] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain.[174][175] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.[176]\n\n\nPoor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[177][178] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[179] In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[180]\n\n\nOn 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[181]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2023, Spanish prosecutors said they had filed a complaint against Barcelona and two of the La Liga club's ex-presidents over alleged payments to a company owned by a senior refereeing official to influence match results.[182] On 23 March 2023, UEFA said it had opened an investigation into the club for a potential violation of the European soccer governing body's legal framework regarding payments made by the club to a company owned by a senior refereeing official.[183] Four months later, UEFA announced that it temporarily accepted the club's participation in UEFA competitions, reserving the possibility of taking future measures depending on the evolution of the case, which came to be known as the Negreira case. UEFA obligated FC Barcelona to keep informed of the progress of the ongoing investigations proactively and to provide all the documents and information they request.[184][185]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supporters of FC Barcelona\n\n![](image)Tifo at the Camp Nou in a 2013 comeback against AC Milan.\nThe nickname *culer* for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan *cul* (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their *culs* over the stand.[186][187] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[188] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[189] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[190] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[191][192] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called *socis*.[193]\n\n\nIn addition to membership, as of March 2022[update] there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called *penyes*, around the world.[194] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[195] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2021[update], only behind Real Madrid with 111 million.[11][196] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## Club rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### *El Clásico*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Clásico\n\n![](image)Players jostle in Barcelona's 2–6 win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 2009 *El Clásico*.\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (*El Clásico*). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[199] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[200]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona fans creating a mosaic of the Catalan flag before a 2012 *El Clasico* at the Camp Nou\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[201][202] In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the *Coup d'état* against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops[203] (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).[201] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto *Més que un club* (*English: More than a club*) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[204]\n\n\nThere's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its *royal* name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed *CF Barcelona* succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[205] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.[206][207]\n\n\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to *Los Blancos*, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[208]\n\n\nDi Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[209] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[210] An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[211]\n\n\n\n### *El derbi Barceloní*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Derbi Barceloní\n\n![](image)Barcelona players parade La Liga trophy around the Camp Nou in May 2006 after defeating Espanyol in their last home game of the season.\nBarça's local rival has always been Espanyol. *Blanc-i-blaus*, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[212] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[213] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[214][215]\n\n\nTraditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[216] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[217]\n\n\nIn 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[212] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the *derbi* has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[212]\n\n\nThough it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[218]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry with AC Milan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona's ultras *Boixos Nois* in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League semi-final against AC Milan at San Siro\nOne of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan.[219][220][221][222] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26).[223][224][225] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[226] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.[227]\n\n\nBarcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[228] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[229][230] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at the Camp Nou.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Ownership and finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Civil Guards at the *socis*' entrance of the Camp de la Indústria\nAlong with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association.[233][234] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[235] The members of Barcelona, called *socis*, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[236] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 *socis*.[193]\n\n\nIn 2010, *Forbes* evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[237][238] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[239] In 2013, *Forbes* magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[240] In 2014, *Forbes* ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[241][242] In 2017, *Forbes* ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion.[243] In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues.[244] In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.[245][246] However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.[244]\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of FC Barcelona records and statistics\n\n![](image)Xavi made 767 total appearances for Barcelona, a former club record.\nIn March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.[247]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi is Barcelona's all-time top appearance maker, top scorer, and the highest scoring player for a single club.\nBarcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez's 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years.[248] In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé’s 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club.[249] Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions,[250] and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga.[251] Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108).[252] Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 64 goals.[253]\n\n\nLászló Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952.[254] Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.[255] Eulogio Martínez became Barça's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.[250]\n\n\nBarcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[256] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[257] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.[258][259]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pep Guardiola is Barcelona's most successful coach, with 14 trophies.\nBarcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andrés Iniesta, with 32 trophies.[260]\n\n\nBarcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[261] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[262]\n\n\n*El Barça de les Cinc Copes* is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[263][264][265] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[266][267] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple).[268][269] In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history.[270][271] In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.[272][273]\n\n\nIn 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.[274]\n\n\n\n## Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to FC Barcelona kits.\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe first crest (left) worn by Barça from 1899 to 1910, and second crest (right), designed by Carles Comamala in 1910\n\nThe club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[31] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[275] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[276]\n\n\nThe blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[277] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[278][279]\n\n\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[280][281]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n1899–1910 [n1 1]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n1910–present [n1 2]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2015–16 [n1 3]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2019–20 [n1 4]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2021–22 [n1 5]\n |\n\n\nNotes\n1. **^** The first kit worn by the club in 1899.[282] In the 1999–2000 season, a similar model was worn to commemorate the 100th. anniversary of the club.[283]\n2. **^** Traditional Barcelona uniform.[284]\n3. **^** The club used horizontal stripes during the 2015–16 season.[285]\n4. **^** The club used a checkered design during the 2019–20 season.[286]\n5. **^** The club used halved shorts and a crest-inspired shirt during the 2021–22 season.[287]\n\n### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nike has been Barcelona's official kit supplier since 1998.\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt main sponsor\n | Shirt sub sponsor(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1899–1982\n | *None* | *None* | *None* |\n| 1982–1992\n | Meyba |\n| 1992–1998\n | Kappa |\n| 1998–2003\n | Nike |\n| 2003–2004\n | Forum[288] (left sleeve)\n |\n| 2004–2006\n | TV3 (left sleeve)\n |\n| 2006–2011\n | UNICEF |\n| 2011–2013\n | Qatar Foundation | TV3 (left sleeve) & UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2013–2014\n | Qatar Airways(€33,5m/year) [289][290] | UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2014–2017\n | Beko (left sleeve) & UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2017–2021\n | Rakuten(€55m/year) [291][292][293] |\n| 2021–2022\n | UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2022–2023\n | Spotify | UNHCR (back shirt)\n |\n| 2023–\n | AMBILIGHT TV (left sleeve) & UNHCR (back shirt)\n |\n\n\n## Anthems[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cant del Barça\n\nThroughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is El Cant del Barça (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.[294][295]\n\n\nThe song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at the Camp Nou stadium before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at the Camp Nou stadium. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys.\n\n\nEl Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at the Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory.\n\n\n\n## Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Camp de la Indústria, Camp de Les Corts, and Camp Nou\n\n![](image)Camp de Les Corts in 1939. It was the home stadium for Barcelona until the club moved to the Camp Nou in 1957.\nBarcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[296]\n\n\nIn 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[297]\n\n\nAfter the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[297][298][299] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[297] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.[297]\n\n\n\n![The words \"Més que un club\" are painted in yellow on the blue seats of the stadium](image)One of the Camp Nou stands displays Barcelona's motto, *\"Més que un club\"*, meaning 'More than a club'.\nIn 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.[300][301][302] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[303] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[304]\n\n\nIn December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the *Espai Barça* project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history.[305] Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding.[306][307][308] During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023–24 season to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.[309]\n\n\nThere are also other facilities, which include:[310]\n\n\n\n* Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper (FC Barcelona's training ground)\n* Masia-Centre de Formació Oriol Tort (Residence of young players)\n* Estadi Johan Cruyff (Home of the reserve team, women's team, and Juvenil A)\n* Palau Blaugrana (FC Barcelona indoor sports arena)\n* Palau Blaugrana 2 (Secondary indoor arena of FC Barcelona)\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona records and statistics, FC Barcelona in international football competitions, and List of FC Barcelona seasons\n\n\n\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | La Liga[311] | 27\n | 1929, 1944–45, 1947–48, 1948–49, 1951–52, 1952–53, 1958–59, 1959–60, 1973–74, 1984–85, 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1997–98, 1998–99, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2022–23 |\n| Copa del Rey[311] | **31** | 1910, 1912, 1913, 1920, 1922, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1942, 1951, 1952, 1952–53, 1957, 1958–59, 1962–63, 1967–68, 1970–71, 1977–78, 1980–81, 1982–83, 1987–88, 1989–90, 1996–97, 1997–98, 2008–09, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2020–21 |\n| Supercopa de España[311] | **14** | 1983, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018, 2022–23 |\n| Copa Eva Duarte[311] | **3** | 1948, 1952, 1953 |\n| Copa de la Liga[311] | **2** | 1983, 1986 |\n| **Continental** | UEFA Champions League[311] | 5\n | 1991–92, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15 |\n| UEFA Cup Winners' Cup[311] | **4** | 1978–79, 1981–82, 1988–89, 1996–97 |\n| UEFA Super Cup[311] | **5**S | 1992, 1997, 2009, 2011, 2015 |\n| Inter-Cities Fairs Cup[311] | **3** | 1955–58, 1958–60, 1965–66 |\n| Latin Cup[311] | **2**S | 1949, 1952 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup[311] | 3\n | 2009, 2011, 2015 |\n| **Regional** | Catalan football championship[311] | **23** | 1901–02, 1902–03, 1904–05, 1908–09, 1909–10, 1910–11, 1912–13, 1915–16, 1918–19, 1919–20, 1920–21, 1921–22, 1923–24, 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27, 1927–28, 1929–30, 1930–31, 1931–32, 1933–34, 1935–36, 1937–38 |\n| Copa Catalunya[311] | **8** | 1990–91, 1992–93, 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2004–05, 2006–07, 2012–13, 2013–14 |\n| Supercopa de Catalunya[311] | **2** | 2014, 2018\n |\n\n\n* Record\n* S Shared record\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of FC Barcelona players\n\nFor a list of all former and current FC Barcelona players with a Wikipedia article, see Category:FC Barcelona players.\n\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship.

Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed *Blaugrana*.\n\n\nDomestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5][6][7] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023[update].[8][9][10] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as *El Clásico*.\n\n\nBarcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[11][12] Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[13][14] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[15]\n\n\nBarcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[16][17] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.[18] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.[19] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[20][21][22] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of FC Barcelona\n\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona seasons\n\n### 1899–1922: Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walter Wild, the club's first president (1899–1901).

Our friend and partner, Mr. Kans Kamper, from the Foot-Vall Section of the 'Sociedad Los Deportes' and former Swiss champion, wishing to organise some matches in Barcelona, requests that everyone who likes this sport contact him, come to this office Tuesday and Friday nights from 9 to 11.\"[25]\nOn 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in *Los Deportes* declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[25][26]\n\n\n\n![](image)A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903\nFC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the very first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware,[27] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.[28] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\"[29] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[30]\n\n\nOn 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[31]\n\n\nThe stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[32] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[33] Notable figures of Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru and Jack Greenwell.[34] The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[35]\n\n\nDuring the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[36] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[37]\n\n\nGamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[38] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[39]\n\n\nIn 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga and Franz Platko.[40] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.[41][30]\n\n\n\n### 1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white photo of the city from high above. Smoke from a bomb can be seen](image)The aerial bombardment of Barcelona in 1938\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[42] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Team of FC Barcelona, published on *El Gráfico*, 1926\nOn 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[43] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[44] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[30]\n\n\nAlthough they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[45] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,[41] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them.\n\n\nA month after the entire Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[46] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[47] He was dubbed the martyr of *barcelonisme*, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[48] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[49][50]\n\n\nOn 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[51][52] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to *Club de Fútbol Barcelona* and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)A prolific forward, László Kubala led Barcelona to success in the 1950s. His statue is built outside the Camp Nou.\nIn 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[55] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[56]\n\n\nDespite the difficult political situation, *CF Barcelona* enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[57] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[58] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[59]\n\n\nOn a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[60][61]\n\n\nCoach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini & Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[39]\n\n\n\n### 1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona line up against Hamburger SV before the 1960–61 European Cup semi-final\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[62][63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Suárez, the first Barcelona player to win the Ballon d'Or\nThe 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[63] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to *Futbol Club Barcelona* and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[64][65]\n\n\nThe 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[66] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[67] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[41] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[68]\n\n\n\n### 1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1979, Barcelona bought La Masia, a farmer's house built in 1702, to be a residence for young academy players. It would later play a significant role in the club's future success.[69][70]\nIn 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[71][72]\n\n\nOn 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling *blaugrana* fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)Diego Maradona's *blaugrana* shirt on display in the FC Barcelona Museum\nIn June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[74] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.[71]\n\n\nAround this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[75] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[76]\n\n\nAfter the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[71]\n\n\n\n#### The *Dream Team* era[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)As coach of the \"Dream Team\", Johan Cruyff won four consecutive league titles with Barcelona.\nIn 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\".[77] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Zubizarreta (C)**\n**Koeman**\n**Nando**\n**Ferrer**\n**Juan Carlos**\n**Eusebio**\n**Guardiola**\n**Bakero**\n**Laudrup**\n**Salinas**\n**Stoichkov**\nStarting lineup for the 1992 European Cup Final, the club's first European Cup/Champions League winning team\n\nIt was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was future Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.[79]\nUnder Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[80] Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[71] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, \"Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it.\"[81]\n\n\nReacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[82] The objective of the group, called *L'Elefant Blau*, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[82][83] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[84]\n\n\nCruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.[85] Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[86]\n\n\nLike Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.[85] However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its *centenari*, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque commemorating the centenary of FC Barcelona\nThe departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[87] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.[88][89][90]\n\n\nDespite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ronaldinho's arrival in 2003 revitalized the club.[92][93]\nAfter the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Valdés**\n**Márquez**\n**Puyol (C)**\n**Oleguer**\n**van Bronckhorst**\n**Edmílson**\n**Giuly**\n**Ronaldinho**\n**Deco**\n**van Bommel**\n**Eto'o**\nBarcelona's victorious 2006 Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[95] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[96]\n\n\nDespite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[97] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[98] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[99] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.[100]\n\n\nBarcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[101]\n\n\n\n### 2008–2012: Guardiola era[edit]\n\n\n![A man wearing long, dark blue shorts and a light blue sweatshirt under an orange bib.](image)\n![A man wearing a light blue sweatshirt and dark blue shorts.](image)\nBarcelona's midfield combination of Andrés Iniesta (left) and Xavi (right) were at the heart of Guardiola's tiki-taka passing style of play.[102]\n\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[101] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi in action during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final victory against Manchester United.\nBarça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time.[104] A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions.[105] Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[106][107][108] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[109] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[110] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[111] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[112][113]\n\n\nAfter Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he got 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[114] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[115] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[116] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[117]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in *El Clásico*.[118] At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.[119] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[120] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[121] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[122] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[123]\n\n\nLater the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies.[124] The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona celebrating their 2011 FIFA Club World Cup win against Santos FC\nIn December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[126] As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16.[127][128] Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”,[21] their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[129]\n\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[130][131] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[132][133] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[134]\n\n\nIt was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager.[135] Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[136] They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[137]\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Bartomeu era[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[138] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals.[139] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar.[140] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.[141]\n\n\n\n![](image)Luis Suárez joined the club in 2014. Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", formed a record-breaking strike force.\nBarcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[142] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[143] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[144] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[145] On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[146] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[147]\n\n\nOn 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[148] The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[149][150] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[151] On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[152][153] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[154][155] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[156] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons.[157] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neymar preparing to take a free kick in Barcelona's comeback against Paris Saint-Germain\nOn 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[159] On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor.[160] On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\".[161] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[162] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played.[163] Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[164] On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.[165] However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.[166]\n\n\nOn 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[167] Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[168] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[169] Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of Barcelona's league performance 1929–2023\nOn 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[172] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[173] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain.[174][175] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.[176]\n\n\nPoor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[177][178] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[179] In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[180]\n\n\nOn 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[181]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2023, Spanish prosecutors said they had filed a complaint against Barcelona and two of the La Liga club's ex-presidents over alleged payments to a company owned by a senior refereeing official to influence match results.[182] On 23 March 2023, UEFA said it had opened an investigation into the club for a potential violation of the European soccer governing body's legal framework regarding payments made by the club to a company owned by a senior refereeing official.[183] Four months later, UEFA announced that it temporarily accepted the club's participation in UEFA competitions, reserving the possibility of taking future measures depending on the evolution of the case, which came to be known as the Negreira case. UEFA obligated FC Barcelona to keep informed of the progress of the ongoing investigations proactively and to provide all the documents and information they request.[184][185]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supporters of FC Barcelona\n\n![](image)Tifo at the Camp Nou in a 2013 comeback against AC Milan.\nThe nickname *culer* for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan *cul* (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their *culs* over the stand.[186][187] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[188] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[189] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[190] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[191][192] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called *socis*.[193]\n\n\nIn addition to membership, as of March 2022[update] there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called *penyes*, around the world.[194] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[195] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2021[update], only behind Real Madrid with 111 million.[11][196] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## Club rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### *El Clásico*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Clásico\n\n![](image)Players jostle in Barcelona's 2–6 win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 2009 *El Clásico*.\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (*El Clásico*). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[199] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[200]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona fans creating a mosaic of the Catalan flag before a 2012 *El Clasico* at the Camp Nou\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[201][202] In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the *Coup d'état* against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops[203] (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).[201] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto *Més que un club* (*English: More than a club*) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[204]\n\n\nThere's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its *royal* name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed *CF Barcelona* succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[205] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.[206][207]\n\n\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to *Los Blancos*, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[208]\n\n\nDi Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[209] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[210] An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[211]\n\n\n\n### *El derbi Barceloní*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Derbi Barceloní\n\n![](image)Barcelona players parade La Liga trophy around the Camp Nou in May 2006 after defeating Espanyol in their last home game of the season.\nBarça's local rival has always been Espanyol. *Blanc-i-blaus*, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[212] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[213] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[214][215]\n\n\nTraditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[216] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[217]\n\n\nIn 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[212] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the *derbi* has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[212]\n\n\nThough it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[218]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry with AC Milan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona's ultras *Boixos Nois* in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League semi-final against AC Milan at San Siro\nOne of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan.[219][220][221][222] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26).[223][224][225] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[226] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.[227]\n\n\nBarcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[228] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[229][230] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at the Camp Nou.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Ownership and finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Civil Guards at the *socis*' entrance of the Camp de la Indústria\nAlong with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association.[233][234] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[235] The members of Barcelona, called *socis*, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[236] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 *socis*.[193]\n\n\nIn 2010, *Forbes* evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[237][238] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[239] In 2013, *Forbes* magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[240] In 2014, *Forbes* ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[241][242] In 2017, *Forbes* ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion.[243] In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues.[244] In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.[245][246] However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.[244]\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of FC Barcelona records and statistics\n\n![](image)Xavi made 767 total appearances for Barcelona, a former club record.\nIn March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.[247]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi is Barcelona's all-time top appearance maker, top scorer, and the highest scoring player for a single club.\nBarcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez's 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years.[248] In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé’s 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club.[249] Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions,[250] and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga.[251] Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108).[252] Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 64 goals.[253]\n\n\nLászló Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952.[254] Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.[255] Eulogio Martínez became Barça's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.[250]\n\n\nBarcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[256] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[257] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.[258][259]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pep Guardiola is Barcelona's most successful coach, with 14 trophies.\nBarcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years).

The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[261] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[262]\n\n\n*El Barça de les Cinc Copes* is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[263][264][265] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[266][267] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple).[268][269] In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history.[270][271] In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.[272][273]\n\n\nIn 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.[274]\n\n\n\n## Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to FC Barcelona kits.\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe first crest (left) worn by Barça from 1899 to 1910, and second crest (right), designed by Carles Comamala in 1910\n\nThe club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[31] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[275] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[276]\n\n\nThe blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[277] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[278][279]\n\n\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[280][281]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n1899–1910 [n1 1]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n1910–present [n1 2]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2015–16 [n1 3]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2019–20 [n1 4]\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n2021–22 [n1 5]\n |\n\n\nNotes\n1. **^** The first kit worn by the club in 1899.[282] In the 1999–2000 season, a similar model was worn to commemorate the 100th. anniversary of the club.[283]\n2. **^** Traditional Barcelona uniform.[284]\n3. **^** The club used horizontal stripes during the 2015–16 season.[285]\n4. **^** The club used a checkered design during the 2019–20 season.[286]\n5. **^** The club used halved shorts and a crest-inspired shirt during the 2021–22 season.[287]\n\n### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nike has been Barcelona's official kit supplier since 1998.\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt main sponsor\n | Shirt sub sponsor(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1899–1982\n | *None* | *None* | *None* |\n| 1982–1992\n | Meyba |\n| 1992–1998\n | Kappa |\n| 1998–2003\n | Nike |\n| 2003–2004\n | Forum[288] (left sleeve)\n |\n| 2004–2006\n | TV3 (left sleeve)\n |\n| 2006–2011\n | UNICEF |\n| 2011–2013\n | Qatar Foundation | TV3 (left sleeve) & UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2013–2014\n | Qatar Airways(€33,5m/year) [289][290] | UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2014–2017\n | Beko (left sleeve) & UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2017–2021\n | Rakuten(€55m/year) [291][292][293] |\n| 2021–2022\n | UNICEF (back shirt)\n |\n| 2022–2023\n | Spotify | UNHCR (back shirt)\n |\n| 2023–\n | AMBILIGHT TV (left sleeve) & UNHCR (back shirt)\n |\n\n\n## Anthems[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cant del Barça\n\nThroughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is El Cant del Barça (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.[294][295]\n\n\nThe song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at the Camp Nou stadium before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at the Camp Nou stadium. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys.\n\n\nEl Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at the Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory.\n\n\n\n## Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Camp de la Indústria, Camp de Les Corts, and Camp Nou\n\n![](image)Camp de Les Corts in 1939. It was the home stadium for Barcelona until the club moved to the Camp Nou in 1957.\nBarcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[296]\n\n\nIn 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[297]\n\n\nAfter the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[297][298][299] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[297] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.[297]\n\n\n\n![The words \"Més que un club\" are painted in yellow on the blue seats of the stadium](image)One of the Camp Nou stands displays Barcelona's motto, *\"Més que un club\"*, meaning 'More than a club'.\nIn 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.[300][301][302] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[303] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[304]\n\n\nIn December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the *Espai Barça* project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history.[305] Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding.[306][307][308] During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023–24 season to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.[309]\n\n\nThere are also other facilities, which include:[310]\n\n\n\n* Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper (FC Barcelona's training ground)\n* Masia-Centre de Formació Oriol Tort (Residence of young players)\n* Estadi Johan Cruyff (Home of the reserve team, women's team, and Juvenil A)\n* Palau Blaugrana (FC Barcelona indoor sports arena)\n* Palau Blaugrana 2 (Secondary indoor arena of FC Barcelona)\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of FC Barcelona records and statistics, FC Barcelona in international football competitions, and List of FC Barcelona seasons\n\n\n\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | La Liga[311] | 27\n | 1929, 1944–45, 1947–48, 1948–49, 1951–52, 1952–53, 1958–59, 1959–60, 1973–74, 1984–85, 1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1997–98, 1998–99, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2022–23 |\n| Copa del Rey[311] | **31** | 1910, 1912, 1913, 1920, 1922, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1942, 1951, 1952, 1952–53, 1957, 1958–59, 1962–63, 1967–68, 1970–71, 1977–78, 1980–81, 1982–83, 1987–88, 1989–90, 1996–97, 1997–98, 2008–09, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2020–21 |\n| Supercopa de España[311] | **14** | 1983, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018, 2022–23 |\n| Copa Eva Duarte[311] | **3** | 1948, 1952, 1953 |\n| Copa de la Liga[311] | **2** | 1983, 1986 |\n| **Continental** | UEFA Champions League[311] | 5\n | 1991–92, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15 |\n| UEFA Cup Winners' Cup[311] | **4** | 1978–79, 1981–82, 1988–89, 1996–97 |\n| UEFA Super Cup[311] | **5**S | 1992, 1997, 2009, 2011, 2015 |\n| Inter-Cities Fairs Cup[311] | **3** | 1955–58, 1958–60, 1965–66 |\n| Latin Cup[311] | **2**S | 1949, 1952 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup[311] | 3\n | 2009, 2011, 2015 |\n| **Regional** | Catalan football championship[311] | **23** | 1901–02, 1902–03, 1904–05, 1908–09, 1909–10, 1910–11, 1912–13, 1915–16, 1918–19, 1919–20, 1920–21, 1921–22, 1923–24, 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27, 1927–28, 1929–30, 1930–31, 1931–32, 1933–34, 1935–36, 1937–38 |\n| Copa Catalunya[311] | **8** | 1990–91, 1992–93, 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2004–05, 2006–07, 2012–13, 2013–14 |\n| Supercopa de Catalunya[311] | **2** | 2014, 2018\n |\n\n\n* Record\n* S Shared record\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of FC Barcelona players\n\nFor a list of all former and current FC Barcelona players with a Wikipedia article, see Category:FC Barcelona players.\n\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship.

The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation. \n\n\nDomestically, the club has won 19 league titles, eight FA Cups, a record nine League Cups and 16 FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, led the club to a combined 11 League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.\n\n\nLiverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world. The club has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".\n\n\nThe club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths. Most of these were Italians and Juventus fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competition, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroners inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1892–1959, 1959–85, and 1985–present\n\n![Black and white photograph of elder and bald John Houlding, wearing beard and bow tie.](image)John Houlding, the founder of Liverpool F.C.\nLiverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[3] Originally named \"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[4]\n\n\nLiverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players—the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland—so they became known as the \"team of Macs\".[5] The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.[6]\n\n\nLiverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham United centre half George Kay.[7] Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.[8] The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season.[9] Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958–59 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other \"Boot Room\" members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.[10]\n\n\n\n![Statue of a man with his arms held aloft](image)Statue of Bill Shankly outside Anfield. Shankly won promotion to the First Division and the club's first league title since 1947.\nThe club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners' Cup final.[11] Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.[12] In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979.[13] During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 20 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.[14]\n\n\nPaisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.[15] Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season.[16] Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence that separated the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.[17]\n\n\n\n![3 burgundy tablets with gold engraved writing. Below the tablets are flowers.](image)The Hillsborough memorial, which is engraved with the names of the 97 people who died in the Hillsborough disaster\nFagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player-manager.[18] During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup \"Double\" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster: in an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing.[19] Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later, the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness, and the 97th, Andrew Devine, died of injuries sustained in the disaster in 2021.[20][21] After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.[22]\n\n\nLiverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with Arsenal on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the last minute of the season.[23]\n\n\nDalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness.[24] Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final.[25] While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned.[26] In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a \"treble\": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup.[27] Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal.[28] They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.[29][30]\n\n\n\n![A silver trophy with red ribbons on it](image)The European Cup, trophy won by Liverpool for a fifth time in 2005\nHoullier was replaced by Rafael Benítez at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez's first season, Liverpool won the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, beating A.C. Milan 3–2 in a penalty shootout after the match ended with a score of 3–3.[31] The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating West Ham United in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3.[32] American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks became the owners of the club during the 2006–07 season, in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million.[33] The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan, as it had in 2005, but lost 2–1.[34] During the 2008–09 season Liverpool achieved 86 points, its then-highest Premier League points total, prior to the record-breaking 2018–19 season, and finished as runners up to Manchester United.[35]\n\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Benítez subsequently left by mutual consent[36] and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson.[37] At the start of the 2010–11 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the club's creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and of Fenway Sports Group, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010.[38] Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over.[39] In the 2011–12 season, Liverpool secured a record 8th League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final, but finished in eighth position, the worst league finish in 18 years; this led to the sacking of Dalglish.[40][41] He was replaced by Brendan Rodgers,[42] whose Liverpool team in the 2013–14 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions Manchester City and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the 1895–96 season.[43][44] Following a disappointing 2014–15 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the following campaign, Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.[45]\n\n\nRodgers was replaced by Jürgen Klopp.[46] Liverpool reached the finals of the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in Klopp's first season, finishing as runner-up in both competitions.[47] The club finished second in the 2018–19 season with 97 points (surpassing the 86 points gained during the 2008–09 season), losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side.[48] Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.[49][50] Liverpool beat Flamengo of Brazil in the final 1–0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time.[51] Liverpool then went on to win the 2019–20 Premier League, winning their first top-flight league title in thirty years.[52] The club set multiple records in the season, including winning the league with seven games remaining making it the earliest any team has ever won the title,[53] amassing a club record 99 points, and achieving a joint-record 32 wins in a top-flight season.[54]\n\n\n\n## Colours and badge[edit]\n\n\n![A blue and white shirt and white shorts](image)Liverpool's home colours worn from 1892 to 1896[55]\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Liverpool F.C. kits.\n\nFor much of Liverpool's history, its home colours have been all red. When the club was founded in 1892, blue and white quartered shirts were used until the club adopted the city's colour of red in 1896.[3] The city's symbol of the liver bird was adopted as the club's badge (or crest, as it is sometimes known) in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all-red strip.[55] Liverpool played in all red for the first time against Anderlecht, as Ian St John recalled in his autobiography:\n\n\n\n\n> He [Shankly] thought the colour scheme would carry psychological impact – red for danger, red for power. He came into the dressing room one day and threw a pair of red shorts to Ronnie Yeats. \"Get into those shorts and let's see how you look\", he said. \"Christ, Ronnie, you look awesome, terrifying. You look 7 ft tall.\" \"Why not go the whole hog, boss?\" I suggested. \"Why not wear red socks? Let's go out all in red.\" Shankly approved and an iconic kit was born.[56]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team's home kit. Between 2012 and 2015, the kits were designed by Warrior Sports, who became the club's kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season.[57] In February 2015, Warrior's parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance.[58] The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.[59] Nike became the club's official kit supplier at the start of the 2020–21 season.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)A version of Liverpool's badge as depicted on the Shankly Gates\nLiverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor's logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with Hitachi in 1979.[61] Since then the club has been sponsored by Crown Paints, Candy, Carlsberg and Standard Chartered. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football.[62] The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club's sponsor.[63]\n\n\nThe Liverpool badge is based on the city's liver bird symbol, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1977, a red liver bird standing on a football (blazoned as \"*Statant upon a football a Liver Bird wings elevated and addorsed holding in the beak a piece of seaweed gules*\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League intended for use by Liverpool. However, Liverpool never made use of this badge.[64] In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster.[65] In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.[66]\n\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Brand\n | Shirt Sponsor (chest) | Shirt Sponsor (sleeve) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1973–1979\n | Umbro | None\n | None\n |\n| 1979–1982\n | Hitachi |\n| 1982–1985\n | Crown Paints |\n| 1985–1988\n | Adidas |\n| 1988–1992\n | Candy |\n| 1992–1996\n | Carlsberg |\n| 1996–2006\n | Reebok |\n| 2006–2010\n | Adidas |\n| 2010–2012\n | Standard Chartered |\n| 2012–2015\n | Warrior |\n| 2015–2017\n | New Balance |\n| 2017–2020\n | Western Union |\n| 2020–\n | Nike | Expedia |\n\n\n## Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anfield\n\nFor information on Liverpool's abandoned proposed new stadium, see Stanley Park Stadium.\n\n![The interior of a stadium.](image)Anfield, home of Liverpool F.C.\nAnfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park.\nSituated 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre, it was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding.[67] Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.[68]\n\n\nThe Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0.[69] In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal.[70] The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool.[71] At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadiums in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.[72]\n\n\nAnfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s, when, following recommendations from the *Taylor Report*, all clubs in the Premier League were obliged to convert to all-seater stadiums in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing its capacity to 45,276.[73] The findings of the report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.[74]\n\n\nBecause of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002.[75] Planning permission was granted in July 2004,[76] and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999-year lease on the proposed site.[77] Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with HKS, Inc. contracted to build the stadium.[78] Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300 million needed for the development.[79] In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m.[80] When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a £260 million project to improve the Anfield area. Jürgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as \"impressive.\"[81]\n\n\nIn June 2021, it was reported that Liverpool Council had given planning permission for the club to renovate and expand the Anfield Road stand, boosting the capacity by around 7,000 and taking the overall capacity at Anfield to 61,000. The expansion, which is estimated to cost £60m, was described as \"a huge milestone\" by managing director Andy Hughes, and would also see rail seating being trialled in the Kop for the 2021–22 Premier League season.[82]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\n![A single-tiered stand that contains thousands of people. Several flags are being waved. In front of the stand is a grass pitch with a goal.](image)*Kopites* in The Kop Stand\nLiverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world.[83][84] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly.[85] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours,[86] which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan, U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia.[87][88] Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield.[89] In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.[90]\n\n\nThe song \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical *Carousel* and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers, is the club's anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s.[91] It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world.[92] The song's title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club's badge.[93]\n\n\n\n![Design of the top of a set of gates, with the sky visible. The inscription on the gates reads \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".](image)The Shankly Gates, erected in honour of former manager Bill Shankly\nThe club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 people, mostly Italians and Juventus supporters, were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters,[94] and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990.[95] Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial.[96] In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14 Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter;[97] half of the terms were suspended.[98]\n\n\nThe second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-seven Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days, *The Sun*'s coverage of the event spread falsehoods, particularly an article entitled \"The Truth\" that claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police.[99] Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy *The Sun* 30 years later.[100] Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.[101]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Merseyside derby and Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry\n\n![](image)Liverpool players (in grey) during their 4–1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 14 March 2009\nLiverpool's longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the Merseyside derby. The rivalry stems from Liverpool's formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield.[102] The Merseyside derby is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence has been known as the \"friendly derby\".[103] Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as \"the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League\".[104] In terms of support within the city, the number of Liverpool fans outweighs Everton supporters by a ratio of 2:1.[105]\n\n\nLiverpool's rivalry with Manchester United stems from the cities' competition in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.[106] Connected by the world's first inter-city railway, by road Liverpool and Manchester are separated by approximately 30 miles (48 km) along the East Lancs Road.[107] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by *France Football* magazine, Liverpool and Manchester United are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions, and both clubs have a global fanbase.[108][109] Viewed as one of the biggest rivalries in world football, it is considered the most famous fixture in English football.[110][111][112] The two clubs alternated as champions between 1964 and 1967,[113] and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, followed by Liverpool's four European Cup victories.[114] Despite the 39 league titles and nine European Cups between them[113] the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time – Liverpool's run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester United's 26-year title drought, and United's success in the Premier League-era likewise coincided with Liverpool's 30-year title drought,[115] and the two clubs have finished first and second in the league only five times.[113] Such is the rivalry between the clubs they rarely do transfer business with each other. The last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.[116]\n\n\n\n## Ownership and finances[edit]\n\n\nAs the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding's departure.[117] McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League.[118] The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990.[119] His successor was Noel White who became chairman in 1990.[120] In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years, became chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51 percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.[121]\n\n\nMoores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The pair paid £5,000 per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club's debts.[122] Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club.[123] Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale.[124] In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion.[125] The group's creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.[126] Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.[127]\n\n\nLiverpool has been described as a global brand; a 2010 report valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £141m, an increase of £5m on the previous year. Liverpool was given a brand rating of AA (Very Strong).[128] In April 2010 business magazine *Forbes* ranked Liverpool as the sixth most valuable football team in the world, behind Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Barcelona and Bayern Munich; they valued the club at $822m (£532m), excluding debt.[129] Accountants Deloitte ranked Liverpool eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League, which ranks the world's football clubs in terms of revenue. Liverpool's income in the 2009–10 season was €225.3m.[130] According to a 2018 report by Deloitte, the club had an annual revenue of €424.2 million for the previous year,[131] and *Forbes* valued the club at $1.944 billion.[132] In 2018, annual revenue increased to €513.7 million,[133] and *Forbes* valued the club at $2.183 billion.[134] In 2019 revenue increased to €604 million (£533 million) according to Deloitte, with the club breaching the half a billion pounds mark.[135]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the owners of the club came under fire from fans and the media for deciding to furlough all non-playing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.[136] In response to this, the club made a U-turn on the decision and apologised for their initial decision.[137] In April 2021 *Forbes* valued the club at $4.1 billion, a two-year increase of 88%, making it the world's fifth-most-valuable football club.[138]\n\n\n\n\n## Liverpool in the media[edit]\n\n\nLiverpool featured in the first edition of BBC's *Match of the Day*, which screened highlights of their match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967.[139] Liverpool fans featured in the Pink Floyd song \"Fearless\", in which they sang excerpts from \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".[140] To mark the club's appearance in the 1988 FA Cup Final, Liverpool released the \"Anfield Rap\", a song featuring John Barnes and other members of the squad.[141]\n\n\nA docudrama on the Hillsborough disaster, written by Jimmy McGovern, was screened in 1996. It featured Christopher Eccleston as Trevor Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group.[142] Liverpool featured in the 2001 film *The 51st State*, in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.[143] The club also featured in the 1984 children's television show *Scully*, about a young boy who tries to gain a trial with Liverpool.[144] In the *Doctor Who* episode \"The Halloween Apocalypse\", aired in October 2021, features The Doctor (played by Jodie Whittaker) exiting the TARDIS outside Anfield as she exclaims: \"Liverpool? Anfield! Klopp era, classic!\".[145]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n### First-team squad[edit]\n\n\n*As of 1 September 2023*[146]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Alex Raisbeck, who was club captain from 1899 to 1909, was the longest serving captain before being overtaken by Steven Gerrard who served 12 seasons as Liverpool captain starting from the 2003–04 season.[151] The present captain is Virgil van Dijk, who in the 2023–24 season replaced Jordan Henderson who moved to Al-Ettifaq.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Andrew Hannah | 1892–1895\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Jimmy Ross | 1895–1897\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) John McCartney | 1897–1898\n |\n| ![England](image) Harry Storer | 1898–1899\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alex Raisbeck | 1899–1909\n |\n| ![England](image) Arthur Goddard | 1909–1912\n |\n| ![England](image) Ephraim Longworth | 1912–1913\n |\n| ![England](image) Harry Lowe | 1913–1915\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Donald McKinlay | 1919–1920\n |\n| ![England](image) Ephraim Longworth | 1920–1921\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Donald McKinlay | 1921–1928\n |\n| ![England](image) Tom Bromilow | 1928–1929\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) James Jackson | 1929–1930\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Tom Morrison | 1930–1931\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Tom Bradshaw | 1931–1934\n |\n| ![England](image) Tom Cooper | 1934–1939\n |\n\n | \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Matt Busby | 1939–1940\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Willie Fagan | 1945–1947\n |\n| ![England](image) Jack Balmer | 1947–1950\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Taylor | 1950–1953\n |\n| ![England](image) Bill Jones | 1953–1954\n |\n| ![England](image) Laurie Hughes | 1954–1955\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Billy Liddell | 1955–1958\n |\n| ![England](image) Johnny Wheeler | 1958–1959\n |\n| ![England](image) Ronnie Moran | 1959–1960\n |\n| ![England](image) Dick White | 1960–1961\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Ron Yeats | 1961–1970\n |\n| ![England](image) Tommy Smith | 1970–1973\n |\n| ![England](image) Emlyn Hughes | 1973–1978\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Thompson | 1978–1981\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Graeme Souness | 1982–1984\n |\n| ![England](image) Phil Neal | 1984–1985\n |\n\n | \n\n| Name\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alan Hansen | 1985–1988\n |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Ronnie Whelan | 1988–1989\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Alan Hansen | 1989–1990\n |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Ronnie Whelan | 1990–1991\n |\n| ![Scotland](image) Steve Nicol | 1990–1991\n |\n| ![England](image) Mark Wright | 1991–1993\n |\n| ![Wales](image) Ian Rush | 1993–1996\n |\n| ![England](image) John Barnes | 1996–1997\n |\n| ![England](image) Paul Ince | 1997–1999\n |\n| ![England](image) Jamie Redknapp | 1999–2002\n |\n| ![Finland](image) Sami Hyypiä | 2001–2003\n |\n| ![England](image) Steven Gerrard | 2003–2015\n |\n| ![England](image) Jordan Henderson | 2015–2023\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) Virgil van Dijk | 2023–\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Player of the season[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Liverpool Player of the Season Awards\n\n## Club officials[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Owner: ![United States](image) Fenway Sports Group\n* Ambassadors: ![Wales](image) Ian Rush, ![England](image) Robbie Fowler, ![England](image) Michael Owen[152]\n\nLiverpool Football Club and Athletic Grounds Limited[edit]* Principal owner: ![United States](image) John W.

The trophies have ribbons on them and there is memorabilia next to them](image)The six European Cups Liverpool won from 1977 to 2019 on display in the club's museum\nLiverpool's first trophy was the Lancashire League, which it won in the club's first season.[5] In 1901, the club won its first League title, while the nineteenth and most recent was in 2020. Its first success in the FA Cup was in 1965. In terms of the number of trophies won, Liverpool's most successful decade was the 1980s, when the club won six League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Football League Super Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared) and two European Cups.\n\n\nThe club has accumulated more top-flight wins and points than any other English team.[159] Liverpool also has the highest average league finishing position (3.3) for the 50-year period to 2015[160] and second-highest average league finishing position for the period 1900–1999 after Arsenal, with an average league placing of 8.7.[161]\n\n\nLiverpool is the most successful British club in international football with fourteen trophies, having won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA's premier club competition, six times, an English record and only surpassed by Real Madrid and A.C. Milan. Liverpool's fifth European Cup win, in 2005, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and was also awarded a multiple-winner badge.[162][163] Liverpool also hold the English record of three wins in the UEFA Cup, UEFA's secondary club competition.[164] Liverpool also hold the English record of four wins in the UEFA Super Cup**.**[165] In 2019, the club won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, and also became the first English club to win the international treble of Club World Cup, Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.[166][167]\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool FC honours\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | First Division/Premier League[note 1] | 19\n | 1900–01, 1905–06, 1921–22, 1922–23, 1946–47, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1985–86, 1987–88, 1989–90, 2019–20 |\n| Second Division[note 1] | 4\n | 1893–94, 1895–96, 1904–05, 1961–62 |\n| FA Cup | 8\n | 1964–65, 1973–74, 1985–86, 1988–89, 1991–92, 2000–01, 2005–06, 2021–22 |\n| Football League Cup/EFL Cup | 9\n | 1980–81, 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1994–95, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2011–12, 2021–22 |\n| FA Charity Shield/FA Community Shield | 16\n | 1964\\*, 1965\\*, 1966, 1974, 1976, 1977\\*, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1986\\*, 1988, 1989, 1990\\*, 2001, 2006, 2022 (\\* shared)\n |\n| Football League Super Cup | 1\n | 1985-86 |\n| **Continental** | European Cup/UEFA Champions League | 6\n | 1976–77, 1977–78, 1980–81, 1983–84, 2004–05, 2018–19 |\n| UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League | 3\n | 1972–73, 1975–76, 2000–01 |\n| UEFA Super Cup | 4\n | 1977, 2001, 2005, 2019 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup | 1\n | 2019 |\n\n\n### Minor titles[edit]\n\n\n* Lancashire League\n\t+ Winners (1): 1892–93\n* Sheriff of London Charity Shield\n\t+ Winners (1): 1906\n\n\n### Doubles and trebles[edit]\n\n\n* Doubles:[note 2]\n\t+ League and FA Cup (1): 1985–86\n\t+ League and League Cup (3): 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84\n\t+ League and European Cup (2): 1976–77, 1983–84\n\t+ League and UEFA Cup (2): 1972–73, 1975–76\n\t+ League Cup and European Cup (1): 1980–81\n\t+ FA Cup and League Cup (1): 2021–22\n\n\n* Trebles:[note 2][168]\n\t+ League, League Cup and European Cup (1): 1983–84\n\t+ FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup (1): 2000–01\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Upon its formation in 1992, the Premier League became the top tier of English football; the Football League First and Second Divisions then became the second and third tiers, respectively.

The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\n\n\nFounded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title *real* is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 83,186-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (*socios*) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[6] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023[7][8] and was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football club.[9] In 2023, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €713.8 million.[10]\n\n\nBeing one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably *El Clásico* with Barcelona and *El Derbi Madrileño* with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.[11][12] Real Madrid is known for its *Galácticos* policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[13] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000-2006 and 2009-2018), however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the *Galácticos* legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also suffered under the policy.[14] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record breaking £80 million (€94 million);[15] he became both the club and history's all-time top goalscorer.[16][17][18][19] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham.[20]\n\n\nIn domestic football, the club has won 69 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[21] In European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies;[note 1] a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a record[note 2] five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record eight club world championships.[note 3] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[27] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[28][29]\n\n\nReal Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[30] whilst also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[31] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42),[32] tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[33] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (*three-peat*) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In May 2022, they won a record-extending fourteenth Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognized as such by the Guinness World Records.[34] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[35] As of March 2023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last ten-years (2013–2023) overall.[36][37]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Real Madrid CF\n\nSee also: List of Real Madrid CF seasons\n\n### Early years (1902–1943)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Julián Palacios, the first president of the club in 1900–1902\nReal Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the *Institución Libre de Enseñanza*, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded *(Sociedad) Sky Football* in 1897, commonly known as *La Sociedad* (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, *Nueva Sociedad de Football* (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from *Sky Football*. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, *Sky* was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[38][39][40] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[4] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of *Al Capricho*, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honor of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Madrid FC team in 1906\nThree years after its founding, in 1905, *Madrid FC* won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the *Campo de O'Donnell* in 1912.[43] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[44]\n\n\nIn 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[45] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[46]\n\n\nOn 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honor of General Franco.[note 4][47] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[48] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper *Ya* reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[49] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Lluis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: *Reds! Separatists!*... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[50]\n\n\nReal Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[51] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[52] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[48] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[53]\n\n\n\n### Santiago Bernabéu and unprecedented success (1943–1978)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alfredo Di Stéfano led the club to win five consecutive European Cups (currently the Champions League).\nSantiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[54] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former *Real Madrid Amateurs* player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"*cantera*,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Amancio Amaro, captain of the Yé-yé team of the 1960s\nIn 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of *L'Équipe*, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[56] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[55] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honor.[57] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[58]\n\n\nThe club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[59] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for *Marca* and impersonated the Beatles.[60] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[61] and 1964.[59] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[62] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[63] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honor him during the tournament.[64] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president.\n\n\nBernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[65]\n\n\n\n\n### Quinta del Buitre and sustained success (1980–2000)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Casillas**\n**Helguera**\n**Karanka**\n**Campo**\n**Salgado**\n**Roberto Carlos**\n**McManaman**\n**Redondo (C)**\n**Anelka**\n**Raúl**\n**Morientes**\n2000 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[66][67] Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name *La Quinta del Buitre* (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[66][67] With *La Quinta del Buitre* (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán *Chendo* and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[66][67] In the early 1990s, *La Quinta del Buitre* split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.\n\n\nIn 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[68] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[69]\n\n\nIn November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[70] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[71]\n\n\n\n### Florentino Pérez era (2000–2006)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Galácticos\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**César**\n**Hierro (c)**\n**Helguera**\n**Salgado**\n**Roberto Carlos**\n**Makélélé**\n**Figo**\n**Solari**\n**Zidane**\n**Raúl**\n**Morientes**\n2002 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[72] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[73] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the *Galácticos* team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[74] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the *Zidanes y Pavones* policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Beckham and Zidane were considered *Galácticos*.\nThe few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[76] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[77] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[78] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[78]\n\n\nThe 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[79] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[80] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[81] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[82] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[83]\n\n\n\n### Ramón Calderón era (2006–2009)[edit]\n\n\nRamón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[84] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[85] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[86]\n\n\n\n### Second Florentino Pérez era (2009–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cristiano Ronaldo was the club's most expensive signing when he joined in 2009, costing €94 million.\n![](image)Match between Deportivo de La Coruña and Real Madrid in the 2015–16 season.\nOn 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[87][88] Pérez continued with the *Galácticos* policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[89] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[90] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the *Second Galácticos*.[91] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[92] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[93][94]\n\n\nJosé Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[95][96] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four *Clásicos* were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second *Galáctico* era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[97][98] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[99] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe.\n\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[100] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[101] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[102][103]\n\n\nReal Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the *Blaugrana* six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[104] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[105]\n\n\n\n#### *La Décima* and Champions League dominance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Casillas (C)**\n**Ramos**\n**Varane**\n**Carvajal**\n**Coentrão**\n**Khedira**\n**Modrić**\n**Di María**\n**Bale**\n**Ronaldo**\n**Benzema**\n2014 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup, with a front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo (dubbed BBC)\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrate the club's historic tenth European Cup / Champions League win (*La Décima*) in 2014.\nOn 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[106] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[107] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[108] By that time, *Los Blancos* had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[109] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[110] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"*La Décima*\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[111] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[112]\n\n\nAfter winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[113] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[114] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[115]\n\n\nAfter a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[116] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[117] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[118] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[119] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011–12.[120] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[121] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[122][123]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[124] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first *Clásico* of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[125][126][127] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[128] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[129] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favor, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[130] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"*La Undécima*\".[131][132][133]\n\n\n\n![](image)2016–17 La Liga champions Real Madrid celebrate the title with Community of Madrid President Cristina Cifuentes.\nReal Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[134] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[135] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[136] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[137] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[138] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[139] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[140][141] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"*La Duodécima*\".[142] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[143]\n\n\nReal kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[144] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in *El Clásico* matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[145] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[146] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[147][148] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the *Second Galáctico Era* that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the *Blaugrana* boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[149] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[150] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Following Ronaldo's departure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of Real Madrid's league performance 1929–2023\nOn 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[151][152] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[153] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in *El Clásico* on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[154] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[155] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[156] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[157]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[158] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[159] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[160] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[161][162]\n\n\n\n#### Further domestic success and *La Decimocuarta*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrating the double on 29 May 2022, the day after their Champions League victory\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Courtois**\n**Militão**\n**Alaba**\n**Carvajal**\n**Mendy**\n**Casemiro**\n**Modrić**\n**Kroos**\n**Valverde**\n**Vinícius Jr.**\n**Benzema (C)**\n2022 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nZidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[163] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[164] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[165][166][167] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[168] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[169] defeating pre-tournament favorites Paris Saint-Germain,[170][171] defending champions and favorites Chelsea,[172] Premier League champions and heavy favorites Manchester City,[173] all in dramatic fashion,[174] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favorites,[175] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius goal sealed the 14th European Cup for *Los Blancos*, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[176][177] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favored to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[178]\n\n\n\n## Crests and colours[edit]\n\n\n### Crests[edit]\n\n\n* ![1902](image)\n\n1902\n* ![1908](image)\n\n1908\n* ![1920](image)\n\n1920\n* ![1931](image)\n\n1931\n* ![1941](image)\n\n1941\n* ![2001](image)\n\n2001\n\n\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.\nThe first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[179] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[180] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself *Real Madrid Club de Fútbol*.[179]\n\n\nWith the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[46] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[181][54] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name *Real Madrid Club de Fútbol*.[179] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[179]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (1902–2000).\n ![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (2000–present).\n\n![](image)Real Madrid in 1964. Nicknamed *Los Blancos* (The Whites), the club has worn an all-white home kit except for one season in 1925.\nReal Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honor of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[182] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 5] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[54] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[183]\n\n\nReal's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[184][185] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[186][187] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[188] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[189][190] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[191] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[192] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid's jersey (worn by Luka Modrić in 2015) is manufactured by Adidas, with Emirates the shirt sponsor.\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt sponsor\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980–1982\n | Adidas | —\n |\n| 1982–1985\n | Zanussi |\n| 1985–1989\n | Hummel | Parmalat |\n| 1989–1991\n | Reny Picot\n |\n| 1991–1992\n | Otaysa\n |\n| 1992–1994\n | Teka |\n| 1994–1998\n | Kelme |\n| 1998–2001\n | Adidas\n |\n| 2001–2002\n | Realmadrid.com[note 6] |\n| 2002–2005\n | Siemens mobile |\n| 2005–2006\n | Siemens |\n| 2006–2007\n | BenQ-Siemens |\n| 2007–2013\n | bwin |\n| 2013–0000 | Emirates |\n\n\n#### Kit deal[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier | Period | Contractannouncement | Contractduration | Value | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adidas\n | 1998–present\n |\n| Undisclosed\n | 2015–2020 (6 years)\n | Total €1 billion[194] |  |\n| 8 May 2019\n | 2020–2028 (8 years)[195] | Total €1.1 billion[196] |  |\n\n\n*Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.*\n\n\n\n## Grounds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Estadio Chamartín, Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium\n\n\n\nSantiago Bernabéu| ![](image) |\n| Capacity | 81,044 |\n| Field size | 107 m × 72 m (351 ft × 236 ft)[197] |\n| Construction |\n| Broke ground | 27 October 1944 |\n| Opened | 14 December 1947 |\n| Architect | Manuel Muñoz Monasterio, Luis Alemany Soler, Antonio Lamela |\n\n\nAfter moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[43] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[198] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[45] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[54][199] Initially knows as *Nuevo Chamartín*, the stadium was renamed in honor of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[55] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with *Los Blancos* winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[54]\n\n\nThe capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[200] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[200] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[201][202][203][204]\n\n\nThe Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[205] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[206] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[207]\n\n\nOn 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[208] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[209][210]\n\n\nThe latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to just over the 85,000 mark.[211][212] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[213][214] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[215][216]\n\n\n\n## Records and statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics\n\nSee also: Real Madrid CF in international football\n\n![](image)Raúl is Real Madrid's all-time leader in appearances.\nRaúl holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741 first-team matches from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710 times.[217] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 200 caps, Cristiano Ronaldo is Real's most capped international player. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's record goalscorer and the first player ever to score against every team in a single La Liga season.\nCristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[218][219] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[220]\n\n\nOfficially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a Copa del Rey match in 2006. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 81,044.[221] The club's average attendance in the 2007–08 season was 76,234, the highest in European leagues.[222] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (35 as of 2021–22) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gareth Bale is the club's joint record signing, costing €100 million in 2013.\nThe club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fourteen times[224] and for the most semi-finals appearances (32). As of June 2023, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[225] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide.[226] The same season, the team tied the record winning streak in the Champions League, with ten games.[227] In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game.[228]\n\n\nIn June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[229][230] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[107] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[231] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[232] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[233]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The number of season tickets at the Bernabéu is capped at 65,000, with the remaining seats made available to the general public.\nDuring most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[234] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a *socio*, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 *peñas* (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[235][236]\n\n\nReal Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called *Ultras Sur* supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio *Irriducibili* fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[237][238] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[239][240] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[241]\n\n\nQuestioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[242] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[243]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### El Clásico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Clásico\n\n![](image)Scene from a 2011 *El Clásico* at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (*El Clásico*). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[244] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[245]\n\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid fans displaying the white of their club before *El Clásico*. Real Madrid fans also often wave Spanish flags at *El Clásico* games.[246]\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[247][248] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto *Més que un club* (*English: More than a club*) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[249]\n\n\nThere is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[250] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[251][181]\n\n\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to *Los Blancos*, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[252]\n\n\nDi Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[253] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[254] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[255] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[256] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[257] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[257][258] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[257] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[257] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[257] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[259]\n\n\n\n### El Derbi madrileño[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Madrid derby\n\n![](image)Real Madrid supporters during the 2006 *El Derbi madrileño* match held at the Santiago Bernabéu\nThe club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[45] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[181] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were *\"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\"* – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[260][261]\n\n\nThe rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[262] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[263] It is worth noting that by then, Real Madrid was not very keen on signing non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, *\"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\"* (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[264] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[265][266] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region).\n\n\nBetween 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable.[267] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[268] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[269] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[270]\n\n\n\n### El Viejo Clásico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Viejo Clásico\n\n![](image)Real Madrid's Guti (left) and Athletic Bilbao's Javi Martínez (centre) and Amorebieta (right) during a match at the Bernabéu, 2010\nA further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (*the old classic*),[271] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[272][273] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by *El Clásico*.[274]\n\n\nAthletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[275] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the *Lions* have collected no major trophies since 1984 and won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[271][276][277] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[278][261][279]\n\n\n\n### European rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Real Madrid CF in international football § European Cup / UEFA Champions League\n\n#### Bayern Munich[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bayern Munich–Real Madrid rivalry\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrating a goal against Bayern Munich in 2007\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning fourteen times and Bayern winning six times.[280][281] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[282] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[283][284][285] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium), and then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate on their way to winning the competition.[286] They were also drawn together in the 2016–17 quarter-finals; Real Madrid won 6–3 on aggregate after extra time and subsequently lifted the trophy.[282] The following year, they met in the semi-finals, with Real Madrid again progressing 4–3.[287] Until the 2018–19 season, when they were twice defeated in Madrid by three-goal margins,[288][289] Real's biggest loss at home in the Champions League had been at the hands of Bayern on 29 February 2000, 2–4.[290]\n\n\n\n#### Juventus[edit]\n\n\nAnother match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[291][292][293]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pre-match display at the 2017 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Juventus\nTheir first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[292] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[292] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[292][294] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[292] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the *Bianconeri* in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[295]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[292] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[292][296][297]\n\n\nThe latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[298][299] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[300] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[301] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[302]\n\n\n\n## Finances and ownership[edit]\n\n\nIt was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[303] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[75] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[304]\n\n\nThe sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[305] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[78]\n\n\nBy September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[306] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[307] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[308] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[309]\n\n\nA study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[310] In 2010, *Forbes* evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[311][312] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[313]\n\n\nAlong with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[314] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[315] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[316] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 *socios*.[317] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[318][319]\n\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[318] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[318] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[320] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, *Forbes* listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[321] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[10] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[322][323] In 2022, *Forbes* listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[9]\n\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the *Goal!* football movie trilogy, *Goal! 2: Living the Dream...* (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324]\n\n\n*Real, The Movie* is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on *galácticos* such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase.\n\n\nThe book *White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid* by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled *Legends*, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325]\n\n\n\n### Real Madrid TV[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre.\n\n\n\n### *Hala Madrid*[edit]\n\n\n\"Hala Madrid\" redirects here. For the club's anthem, see Hala Madrid y nada más.\n\n*Hala Madrid* is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the *Madridistas Fan Club* card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[327] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times.\n\n\nIn 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being *Real Madrid: The Game*, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay.\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nFor a comprehensive listing of Real Madrid honours, see List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics § Honours.\n\n\n\nReal Madrid CF honours\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | La Liga[22] | **35** | 1931–32, 1932–33, 1953–54, 1954–55, 1956–57, 1957–58, 1960–61, 1961–62, 1962–63, 1963–64, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1971–72, 1974–75, 1975–76, 1977–78, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1985–86, 1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90, 1994–95, 1996–97, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2011–12, 2016–17, 2019–20, 2021–22 |\n| Copa del Rey[22][328] | **20** | 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1917, 1934, 1936, 1946, 1947, 1961–62, 1969–70, 1973–74, 1974–75, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1988–89, 1992–93, 2010–11, 2013–14, 2022–23 |\n| Copa de la Liga[22] | **1** | 1985 |\n| Supercopa de España[22][329] | **12** | 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2019–20, 2021–22 |\n| Copa Eva Duarte | **1** | 1947 |\n| **Continental** | European Cup/UEFA Champions League[22] | **14** | 1955–56, 1956–57, 1957–58, 1958–59, 1959–60, 1965–66, 1997–98, 1999–2000, 2001–02, 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2021–22 |\n| UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League[22][330] | **2** | 1984–85, 1985–86 |\n| UEFA Super Cup[22] | **5**s | 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2022 |\n| Latin Cup[22][23] | **2**s | 1955, 1957 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup[22] | **5** | 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| Intercontinental Cup[22][331] | **3**s | 1960, 1998, 2002 |\n| Ibero-American Cup[25][26] | **1** | 1994 |\n| **Regional** | Campeonato de Madrid/Campeonato Regional Centro[22] | **23** | 1903, 1904–05, 1905–06, 1906–07, 1907–08, 1912–13, 1915–16, 1916–17, 1917–18, 1919–20, 1921–22, 1922–23, 1923–24, 1925–26, 1926–27, 1928–29, 1929–30, 1930–31, 1931–32, 1932–33, 1933–34, 1934–35, 1935–36\n |\n| Copa Federación Centro | **4** | 1923, 1928, 1943, 1945\n |\n\n\n* record\n* s shared record\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Real Madrid CF players\n\nFor a list of all former and current Real Madrid CF players with a Wikipedia article, see Category:Real Madrid CF players.\n\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship.

V.** (**FCB**, pronounced [ˈfuːsbalˌklʊp ˈbaɪɐn ˈmʏnçn̩] ⓘ), also known as **FC Bayern** (pronounced [ˌɛft͡seː ˈbaɪɐn] ⓘ), **Bayern Munich**, or simply **Bayern**, is a German professional sports club based in Munich, Bavaria. It is best known for its professional men's association football team, which plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Bayern is the most successful club in German football history, having won a record 33 national titles, including 11 consecutively since 2013, and 20 national cups, along with numerous European honours.\n\n\nFC Bayern Munich was founded in 1900 by 11 football players, led by Franz John.[4] Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, they won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of the Treble, after which it became the second European club to achieve the feat twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally, and the only German club to have won both international titles. Bayern players have accumulated five Ballon d'Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, four European Golden Shoe and three UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards, including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\n\n\nBy winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the \"sextuple\" (winning the League, Cup, and Champions League in one season followed by the Domestic Supercup, UEFA Supercup and Club World Cup in the next season), or all trophies that a club competes for in a given calendar year. Bayern Munich are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, the only German club to achieve that. As of May 2023, Bayern Munich are ranked second in UEFA club rankings. The club has traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg.\n\n\nSince the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously, the team had played at Munich's Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white, and the crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria. In terms of revenue, Bayern Munich is the largest sports club in Germany and the third highest-earning football club in the world, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, with a value of €634.1 million in 2021.[5] In August 2023, Bayern had more than 300,000 official members and 4,557 officially registered fan clubs, with over 362,000 members. The club has other departments for chess, handball, basketball, gymnastics, bowling, table tennis and senior football, with more than 1,100 active members.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of FC Bayern Munich\n\n### Early years (1900s–1960s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first game of FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Nürnberg in 1901\nFC Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association (DFB), 11 members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against FC Nordstern,[7] and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 South German championship.[4] In the following years, the club won some local trophies and in 1910–11 Bayern joined the newly founded \"Kreisliga\", the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of the First World War in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.[8][9] By the end of its first decade of founding, Bayern had attracted its first German national team player, Max *Gaberl* Gablonsky.[10] By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.[10]\n\n\nIn the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later.[8][11] Its first national title was gained in 1932, when coach Richard \"Little Dombi\" Kohn led the team to the German championship by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2–0 in the final.[8]\n\n\nThe rise of Adolf Hitler to power put an abrupt end to Bayern's development. Club president Kurt Landauer and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the \"Jew's club\" while local rival 1860 Munich gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated in 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. After a friendly match in Switzerland, some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was a spectator, and the club was subject to continued discrimination.[12] Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again, which led to the move of the gifted young centre-forward Oskar Rohr to Switzerland. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.[13]\n\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War in 1945, Bayern became a member of the Oberliga Süd, the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern ultras *Schickeria*.[14][15] In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the *Oberliga* in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final.[16][17]\n\n\nThe club struggled financially, though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. Manufacturer ousted president Reitlinger, who was later convicted for financial irregularities, was ousted in the elections of 1958 by the industrialist Roland Endler. He provided financial stability for the club. Under his reign, Bayern had its best years in the Oberliga.[18] Endler was no longer a candidate in 1962, when Wilhelm Neudecker, who became wealthy in the postwar construction boom, replaced him.\n\n\nIn 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. The key to qualifying for the Bundesliga was the accumulated record of the last twelve years, where Bayern was only the sixth-ranked club. To boot, local rivals TSV 1860 Munich, ranked seventh, were champions of the last Oberliga-Süd season and were given preference on the basis of this achievement.[19][20] After initial protests by Bayern for alleged mistreatment remained fruitless, president Neudecker rose to the challenge and hired Zlatko Čajkovski, who in 1962 led 1. FC Köln to the national championship. Fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier – who would later be collectively referred to as *the axis*, they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965.[17]\n\n\n\n### The golden years (1960s–1970s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gerd Müller\n![](image)Franz Beckenbauer and Roberto Perfumo before a friendly v Argentina in 1970\nIn their first Bundesliga season, Bayern finished third and also won the DFB-Pokal. This qualified them for the following year's European Cup Winners' Cup, which they won in a dramatic final against Scottish club Rangers, when Franz Roth scored the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory.[17] In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal, but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1. FC Köln and Werder Bremen. Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season.[21]\n\n\nUdo Lattek took charge in 1970. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, Lattek led Bayern to their third German championship. The deciding match in the 1971–72 season against Schalke 04 was the first match in the new Olympiastadion, and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1 and thus claimed the title, also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored.[22] Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the 1974 European Cup Final against Atlético Madrid, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay.[23] This title – after winning the Cup Winners' trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (1968 and 1972) in that competition – marked the club's breakthrough as a force on the international stage.\n\n\n\n![](image)FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Magdeburg in 1974\nDuring the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. \"We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners, but we were very, very lucky\", stated Franz Beckenbauer. Billy Bremner believed the French referee was \"very suspicious\". Leeds fans then rioted in Paris and were banned from European football for three years.[24] A year later in Glasgow, Saint-Étienne were defeated by another Roth goal and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the Intercontinental Cup, in which they defeated Brazilian club Cruzeiro over two legs.[25] The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for New York Cosmos and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and Uli Hoeneß retired while Gerd Müller joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers.[26] *Bayerndusel* was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.\n\n\n\n### From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1970s–1990s)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed *FC Breitnigge*, led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired, and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in 1982 and 1987.[27]\n\n\nJupp Heynckes was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90, Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in 1990–91, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In 1993–94, Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City, who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion.[28] Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.[29]\n\n\nHis successors as coach, Giovanni Trapattoni and Otto Rehhagel, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club's high expectations.[30] During this time, Bayern's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname *FC Hollywood*.[31] Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the 1995–96 season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the UEFA Cup, beating Bordeaux in the final.[32] For the 1996–97 season, Trapattoni returned to win the championship. In the following season, Bayern lost the title to newly promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Renewed international success (1990s–2000s)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Allianz Arena, opened in 2005, is one of the world's most modern football stadiums.\nAfter his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld's first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came close to winning the Champions League, losing 2–1 to Manchester United into injury time after leading for most of the match.[35] The following year, in the club's centenary season, Bayern won the third league and cup double in its history. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal on the final day of the league season.[36][37] Days later, Bayern won the Champions League for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating Valencia on penalties.[38] The 2001–02 season began with a win in the Intercontinental Cup,[39] but ended trophyless otherwise. In 2002–03, Bayern won their fourth double, leading the league by a record margin of 16 points.[40] Hitzfeld's reign ended in 2004, with Bayern underperforming, including defeat by second division Alemannia Aachen in the DFB-Pokal.[41]\n\n\nFelix Magath took over and led Bayern to two consecutive doubles. Prior to the start of the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shared with 1860 Munich.[42] On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.[43]\n\n\nHitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the 2006–07 season in fourth position, thus failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the DFB-Pokal and the DFB-Ligapokal left the club with no honours for the season.\n\n\n\n### Robbery – Robben and Ribery (2000s 2010s)[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild. They signed a total of eight new players and sold, released or loaned out nine of their players.[44] Among new signings were 2006 World Cup stars such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern went on to win the Bundesliga in convincing fashion, leading the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.[45]\n\n\nAfter the season, Bayern's long-term goalkeeper Oliver Kahn retired, which left the club without a top-tier goalkeeper for several seasons.[46] The club's coach Ottmar Hitzfeld also retired and Jürgen Klinsmann was chosen as his successor.[47] However, Klinsmann was sacked even before the end of his first season as Bayern trailed Wolfsburg in the league, had lost the quarterfinal of the DFB-Pokal to Bayer Leverkusen, and had been made look silly in the quarterfinal of the Champions League when FC Barcelona scored four times in the first half of the first leg and over the course of both legs Bayern never looked like they could keep up. Jupp Heynckes was named caretaker coach and led the club to a second-place finish in the league.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bayern Munich playing against Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga in September 2011\nFor the 2009–10 season, Bayern hired Dutch manager Louis van Gaal,[49] and Dutch forward Arjen Robben joined Bayern.[50] Robben, alongside Ribéry, would go on to shape Bayern's playstyle of attacking over the wings for the next ten years. The press quickly dubbed the duo \"Robbery\". In addition, David Alaba and Thomas Müller were promoted to the first team. With Müller, van Gaal went so far as to proclaim, \"With me, Müller always plays,\" which has become a much-referenced phrase over the years.[51] On the pitch Bayern had its most successful season since 2001, securing the domestic double[52] and losing only in the final of the Champions League to Inter Milan 0–2.[53] Despite the successful 2009–10 campaign, van Gaal was fired in April 2011 as Bayern was trailing in the league and eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League, again by Inter. Van Gaal's second in command, Andries Jonker, took over and finished the season in third place.[54]\n\n\nJupp Heynckes returned for his second permanent spell in the 2011–12 season. Although the club had signed Manuel Neuer, ending Bayern's quest for an adequate substitute for Kahn, and Jérôme Boateng for the season, Bayern remained without a title for the second consecutive season, coming in second to Borussia Dortmund in the league and the cup.[55] The Champions League final was held at the Allianz and Bayern indeed reached the final in their home stadium but lost the \"Finale dahoam\" as they had termed it to Chelsea on penalties.[56] For the 2012–13 season, Bayern signed Javi Martínez.[57] After Bayern had finished as runner-up to all titles in 2011–12, Bayern went on to win all titles in 2012–13, setting various Bundesliga records along the way,[58] and becoming the first German team to win the treble. Bayern finished the Bundesliga on 91 points, only 11 points shy of a perfect season, and to date, still, the best season ever played. In what was Bayern's third Champions League final appearance within four years, they beat Borussia Dortmund 2–1.[59] A week later, they completed the treble by winning the DFB-Pokal final over VfB Stuttgart.[60] During the season, in January, Bayern had already announced that they would hire Pep Guardiola as coach for the 2013–14 season. Originally the club presented this as Heynckes retiring on the expiration of his contract, but Uli Hoeneß later admitted that it was not Heynckes's decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season. It was actually forced by the club's desire to appoint Guardiola.[61]\n\n\nBayern fulfilled Guardiola's wish of signing Thiago Alcântara from FC Barcelona,[62] and Guardiola's first season started off well with Bayern extending a streak of undefeated league matches from the last season to 53 matches. The eventual loss to Augsburg came two match days after Bayern had already claimed the league title.[63] During the season, Bayern had also claimed two other titles, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup,[64][65] the latter being the last major trophy the club had not yet won. Bayern also won the cup to complete their tenth domestic double,[66] but lost in the semi-final of the Champions League to Real Madrid.[67] Off the pitch, Bayern's president Uli Hoeneß was convicted of tax evasion on 13 March 2014 and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Hoeneß resigned the next day.[68] Vice-president Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 May. Before the 2014–15 season, Bayern picked up Robert Lewandowski after his contract had ended at Borussia Dortmund,[69] and loaned out Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid.[70] Bayern also let Toni Kroos leave for Real.[71] Club icons Bastian Schweinsteiger and Claudio Pizarro left before the 2015–16 season.[72][73] In these two seasons, Bayern defended their league title, including another double in 2015–16,[74] but failed to advance past the semi-finals in the Champions League. Although the club's leadership tried to convince Guardiola to stay, the coach decided not to extend his three-year contract.[75]\n\n\nCarlo Ancelotti was hired as successor to Guardiola.[76] The key transfer for the 2016–17 campaign was Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund.[77] Off the pitch Uli Hoeneß had been released early from prison and reelected as president in November 2016.[78] Under Ancelotti, Bayern claimed their fifth consecutive league title,[79] but did not win the cup or the Champions League. In July 2017, Bayern announced that 1860 Munich would leave the Allianz for good as the club had been relegated to the 4th division.[80] Before the 2017–18 season, Bayern made extensive changes to their squad, signing amongst others young prospects such as Kingsley Coman, Corentin Tolisso, Serge Gnabry and Niklas Süle, and loaning James Rodríguez from Real. Meanwhile, the club's captain, Philipp Lahm, and Xabi Alonso retired, and several other players left the club.[81] As Bayern's performances were perceived to be increasingly lacklustre, Ancelotti was sacked after a 0–3 loss to Paris St. Germain in the Champions League, early in his second season.[82] Willy Sagnol took over as interim manager for a week before it was announced that Jupp Heynckes would finish the season in his fourth spell at the club.[83] During the season, the club urged Heynckes —even publicly— to extend his contract, but Heynckes, aged 73, stayed firm that he would retire for good after the season.[84] The club began a long and extensive search to find a replacement, and eventually Niko Kovač was presented as Heynckes's successor, signing a three-year contract.[85] Heynckes led the club to another championship. In the cup final, Heynckes's last match as coach, Heynckes met his successor on the pitch. Kovač's Eintracht Frankfurt denied Bayern the title, winning 3–1.[86]\n\n\nKovač's first season at the club started slowly, with Bayern falling behind Dortmund in the league throughout the first half of the season. In contrast to similar situations with van Gaal and Ancelotti, the club's leadership decided to protect their coach from criticisms.[87] However, after the winter break, Bayern quickly closed the distance and put themselves first-place in the league. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated by Liverpool in the round of 16, the first time since 2011 that Bayern did not reach the quarterfinal.[88] During the season Arjen Robben announced that it would be his last season for the club,[89] while Uli Hoeneß announced that Franck Ribéry would be leaving at the end of the season.[90] In March 2019, Bayern announced that they had signed Lucas Hernandez from Atlético Madrid for a club and Bundesliga record fee of €80 million.[91][92] On 18 May 2019, Bayern won their seventh straight Bundesliga title as they finished two points above second-place Dortmund with 78 points. This Bundesliga title was Ribéry's ninth and Robben's eighth.[93] A week later, Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final. With the win, Bayern won their 19th German Cup and completed their 12th domestic double.[94]\n\n\n\n### German coaches era (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### Flick era (2010s–2020s)[edit]\n\n\nHansi Flick joined Bayern Munich on 1 July 2019 as an assistant coach.[95] Under Kovač, Bayern was off to a slow start in the league and after a 5–1 loss to Frankfurt, Kovač and Bayern parted ways on 3 November 2019 with Flick being promoted to interim manager.[96][97] After a satisfying spell as interim coach, Bayern announced on 22 December 2019 that Flick would remain in charge until the end of season.[98] Bayern's performances on the pitch picked up noticeably and in April 2020, the club agreed with Flick to a new permanent contract through 2023.[99] Under Flick the club won the league, having played the most successful leg of a Bundesliga season in history,[100] and went on to claim the cup, thus completing the club's 13th domestic double.[101] In the Champions League, Bayern reached their first final since 2013, en route beating FC Barcelona 8–2 in the quarter-finals[102] and Lyon 3–0 in the semi-final.[103] In the final, which was held in Lisbon behind closed doors due to the severity of COVID-19 pandemic, they defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0. Former PSG player Kingsley Coman scored the only goal of the match.[104] With the victory, they became the second European club to complete the seasonal treble in two different seasons, matching the 2014–15 FC Barcelona team.[105]\n\n\nAfter a short break, Bayern started the new season by winning the UEFA Super Cup for the second time in their history. In a closely contested match, Bayern defeated Sevilla 2–1 after extra time, with Javi Martínez scoring the winning goal.[106] On 30 September 2020, they won the 2020 DFL-Supercup after defeating the runners-up of the Bundesliga Dortmund 3–2.[107] In February 2021, they won the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup (postponed from December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) after defeating African champions Al Ahly SC 2–0 by a brace from Robert Lewandowski,[108] and then winning in the final against Mexican team Tigres UANL 1–0 after a goal from Benjamin Pavard and became only the second club to win the sextuple, after Barcelona won it in 2009.[109] Later, Bayern failed to defend its Champions League title, losing to PSG in the quarter-finals on away goals following a 3–3 aggregate draw.[110] However, it managed to win its 9th Bundesliga title in a row.[111] During the season, Robert Lewandowski broke Gerd Müller's record for the number of goals scored in a Bundesliga season after scoring 41 times.[112]\n\n\nOn 27 April 2021, Bayern announced that Flick would be leaving at the end of the season, at his request, and that RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann would become the new manager, effective 1 July.[113] According to multiple reports, Bayern paid Leipzig €25m, a world record for a manager, as compensation for Nagelsmann's services.[114] It was later announced that Flick was leaving to take charge of the German national team of which he had previously been the assistant coach under manager Joachim Löw.[115]\n\n\n\n#### Nagelsmann era (2020s)[edit]\n\n\nUnder new coach Julian Nagelsmann, Bayern have completed the feat of winning 10 consecutive Bundesliga titles following a 3–1 Der Klassiker win.[116] However, the team unexpectedly lost to Villarreal in the Champions League quarter-finals, going out at that stage for the second year in a row.[117] On 24 March 2023, Nagelsmann was released by Bayern and replaced by Thomas Tuchel, who received a contract until 30 June 2025.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Tuchel era (2020s–present)[edit]\n\n\nOn 25 March 2023, Thomas Tuchel was presented at a press conference as the new Bayern manager.[119] With Tuchel in charge, Bayern was immediately eliminated from the DFB-Pokal in the quarter-finals by SC Freiburg,[120] and also in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Manchester City F.C.[121] However, he led them to a record 11th consecutive title by beating 1. FC Köln and winning a close title race with Borussia Dortmund.[122] Oliver Kahn and Hasan Salihamidzic were both dismissed after the club secured the Bundesliga title. Jan-Christian Dreesen replaced Kahn as CEO with a new sporting director yet to be announced.[123] Bayern appointed Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as member of the FC Bayern München AG supervisory board at their regular meeting on 30 May 2023.[124] Bayern Munich have appointed Christoph Freund as the club's new sporting director from 1 September.[125]\n\n\nOn 12 August 2023, Bayern broke the German transfer record again, this time to sign England's captain and all-time leading goalscorer Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of €110m.[126]\n\n\n\n## Kits[edit]\n\n\nIn the original club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905 when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which were meant as an insult.[4] For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all-red home kit with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.[127] Bayern also wore a *Rotwein* coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first-choice colours prior to the late 1960s.[128]\n\n\nThe club's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the 2013–14 season, Bayern used an all-red home kit with a Bavarian flag diamond watermark pattern, a *Lederhosen* inspired white and black *Oktoberfest* away kit, and an all navy blue international kit.[129]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, representing the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there.[130][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt sponsor (chest)\n | Shirt sponsor (sleeve)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1964–1971\n | Palme Trikotfabrik[131] | None\n | None\n |\n| 1971–1974\n | Erima\n |\n| 1974–1978\n | Adidas | Adidas |\n| 1978–1981\n | Magirus Deutz |\n| 1981–1984\n | Iveco Magirus |\n| 1984–1989\n | Commodore |\n| 1989–2002\n | Opel |\n| 2002–2017\n | Deutsche Telekom |\n| 2017–2018\n | Hamad Airport |\n| 2018–2023\n | Qatar Airways |\n| 2023–present\n | Audi |\n\n\n### Kit deals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier | Period | Latest contractannouncement | Current contractduration | Value | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adidas | 1974–present\n | 28 April 2015\n | 2015–2030 (15 years)\n | Total €900 million (€60 million per year)\n | [132][133] |\n\n\n## Crest[edit]\n\n\nBayern's crest has changed several times. Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of Bavaria were included for the first time in 1954.[127] The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes \"Bayern FA\", whereby \"FA\" stands for *Fußball-Abteilung*, i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.\n\n\nThe modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.[127] While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.\n\n\n\nBayern Munich logo history\n* ![1901](image)\n\n1901\n* ![1902–1906](image)\n\n1902–1906\n* ![1906–1919](image)\n\n1906–1919\n* ![1919–1924](image)\n\n1919–1924\n* ![1925–1954[a]](image)\n\n1925–1954[a]\n* ![1954–1996](image)\n\n1954–1996\n* ![1996–2002](image)\n\n1996–2002\n* ![2002–2017](image)\n\n2002–2017\n* ![2017–](image)\n\n2017–\n\n## Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Bayern's first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924\nBayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße.[135] As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.[136]\n\n\nFrom 1925, Bayern shared the Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich.[137] Until World War II, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as *Sechz'ger* (\"Sixties\") Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season.[138] In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.[139][140]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Olympiastadion, home of Bayern Munich from 1972 to 2005\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics, the city of Munich built the Olympiastadion. The stadium, renowned for its architecture,[141] was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the 1971–72 season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. In its early days, the stadium was considered one of the foremost stadiums in the world and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of 1974 FIFA World Cup.[142] In the following years the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 per cent to 66 per cent.[*clarification needed*] Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect Günther Behnisch vetoed major modifications of the stadium.[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena is lit in red for Bayern home games.\nAfter much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of Bavaria, Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the Allianz Arena has been in use since the beginning of the 2005–06 season.[143] Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio.[144] Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000.[145] In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).[146]\n\n\nThe stadium's most prominent feature is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colors for impressive effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for German national team home games.[147]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.[148]\n\n\n\n## Supporters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A part of the \"Südkurve\" – the usual spot of the ultra-scene at Allianz Arena\nAt the 2018 annual general meeting, the Bayern board reported that the club had 291,000 official members and there are 4,433 officially registered fan clubs with over 390,000 members.[149] This makes the club the largest fan membership club in the world.[150] Bayern have fan clubs and supporters all over Germany. Fan club members from all over Germany and nearby Austria and Switzerland often travel more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) to Munich to attend home games at the Allianz Arena.[151] Bayern has an average of 75,000 attendees at the Allianz Arena which is at 100 per cent capacity level. Every Bundesliga game has been sold-out for years.[152] Bayern's away games have been sold out for many years.[153] According to a study by Sport+Markt Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, and the most popular football club in Germany with 10 million supporters.[154]\n\n\nBayern Munich is also renowned for its well-organised ultra scene. The most prominent groups are the *Schickeria München*, the *Inferno Bavaria*, the *Red Munichs '89*, the *Südkurve '73*, the *Munichmaniacs 1996*, the *Red Angels*, and the *Red Sharks*. The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognised for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, racism and homophobia,[155][156][157] and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.[158][159][160][161]\n\n\nFC Bayern Munich are the world's largest football club in terms of members. The Red Ladies are Bayern Munich's first and only international all-female supporter club with over 200 members.[162] They are known for being super fans and creating a safe community for women to talk about the club.[163]\n\n\nStern des Südens is the song which fans sing at FCB home games. In the 1990s they also used to sing *FC Bayern, Forever Number One*.[164] Another notable song is *Mia San Mia*[b] (Bavarian for \"we are who we are\") which is a famous motto of the club as well.[166] A renowned catchphrase for the team is \"*Packmas*\" which is a Bavarian phrase for the German \"*Packen wir es*\", which means \"let's do it\".[167] The team's mascot is called \"Berni\" since 2004.[168]\n\n\nThe club also has a number of high-profile supporters, among them Pope Benedict XVI,[169] Boris Becker, Wladimir Klitschko, Horst Seehofer and Edmund Stoiber, former Minister-President of Bavaria.[170]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bavarian football derbies, Munich derby, and Der Klassiker\n\n![](image)A Munich derby match at the Allianz Arena between Bayern and 1860 Munich in the quarter-final of the 2007–08 DFB-Pokal on 27 February 2008\nBayern is one of three professional football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who was the more successful club in the 1950s and was controversially picked for the initial Bundesliga season in 1963, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting much extra attention from supporters of both clubs.[171] Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.[172]\n\n\nSince the 1920s, 1. FC Nürnberg has been Bayern's main and traditional[173] rival in Bavaria. Philipp Lahm said that playing Nürnberg is \"always special\" and is a \"heated atmosphere\".[173] Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, Nürnberg was far more successful, winning five championships in the 1920s, making the club Germany's record champion. Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later, when they won their tenth championship in 1987, thereby surpassing the number of championships won by Nürnberg.[173][174] The duel between Bayern and Nürnberg is often referred to as the Bavarian Derby.\n\n\nBayern also enjoys a strong rivalry with the 1. FC Kaiserslautern, originating in parts from a game in 1973, when Bayern lost 7–4 after leading 4–1,[175][176] but also from the two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga as well as the city of Kaiserslautern together with the surrounding Palatinate having been part of Bavaria until a plebiscite after the end of the Second World War.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bayern Munich won 2–1 against Borussia Dortmund to win the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League on 25 May 2013.\nSince the 1970s, Bayern's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. In the 1970s this was Borussia Mönchengladbach,[23] in the 1980s the category expanded to include Hamburger SV. In the 1990s, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen[177][178] emerged as the most ardent opponents. Recently Borussia Dortmund, Schalke,[179] and Werder Bremen have been the main challengers in the Bundesliga. Recently, Bayern's main Bundesliga challenger has been Borussia Dortmund.[180] Bayern and Dortmund have competed against each other for many Bundesliga titles. They also have played against each other in the DFB-Pokal final in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2016. The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a DFB-Pokal final. Bayern and Dortmund have also played against each other in the DFL-Supercup in 1989, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The height of the competition between the two clubs was when Bayern defeated Dortmund 2–1 in the final of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League.\n\n\nAmongst Bayern's chief European rivals are Real Madrid,[181] A.C. Milan,[182] and Manchester United due to many classic wins, draws and losses.[177] Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches. Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"*Bestia negra*\" (\"Black Beast\"). Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup.\n\n\n\n## Organization and finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bayern's former president from 1994 to 2009 and former player Franz Beckenbauer\nSee also: Most valuable sports teams\n\nBayern is led mostly by former club players. From 2016 to 2019, Uli Hoeneß served as the club's president, following Karl Hopfner who had been in office from 2014; Hoeneß had resigned in 2014 after being convicted of tax fraud.[183][184] Oliver Kahn was the chairman of the executive board of the AG.[185] The supervisory board of nine consists mostly of managers of big German corporations. Besides the club's president and the board's chairman, they are Herbert Hainer former CEO of (Adidas), Dr. Herbert Diess chairman of (Volkswagen), Dr. Werner Zedelius senior advisor at (Allianz), Timotheus Höttges CEO of (Deutsche Telekom), Prof. Dr. Dieter Mayer, Edmund Stoiber, Theodor Weimer CEO of (Deutsche Börse), and Dr. Michael Diederich speaker of the board at (UniCredit Bank).[186][187]\n\n\nProfessional football at Bayern is run by the spin-off organisation *FC Bayern München AG*. *AG* is short for *Aktiengesellschaft*, and Bayern is run like a joint stock company, a company whose stock are not listed on the public stock exchange, but is privately owned. 75 per cent of *FC Bayern München AG* is owned by the club, the *FC Bayern München e. V.* (*e. V.* is short for *Eingetragener Verein*, which translates into \"Registered Club\"). Three German corporations, the sports goods manufacturer Adidas, the automobile company Audi and the financial services group Allianz each hold 8.33 per cent of the shares, 25 per cent in total.[185] Adidas acquired its shares in 2002 for €77 million. The money was designated to help finance the Allianz Arena.[188] In 2009 Audi paid €90 million for their share. The capital was used to repay the loan on the Allianz Arena.[189] And in early 2014, Allianz became the third shareholder of the company acquiring theirs share for €110 million. With the sale, Bayern paid off the remaining debt on the Allianz Arena 16 years ahead of schedule.[190] Bayern's other sports departments are run by the club.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bayern Munich team bus provided by sponsor MAN\nBayern's shirt sponsor is Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has been Bayern's shirt sponsor since the start of 2002–03 season. The company extended their sponsorship deal in August 2015 until the end of the 2026–27 season.[191] Bayern's kit sponsor is Adidas. Adidas have been Bayern's kit sponsor since 1974. Adidas extended their sponsorship with Bayern on 29 April 2015. The sponsorship deal runs until the end of the 2029–30 season.[192] The premium partners are Audi, Allianz, HypoVereinsbank, Goodyear, Qatar Airways, Siemens, Paulaner Brewery, SAP, DHL, Hamad International Airport and Tipico. Gold sponsors are Coca-Cola, MAN, Procter & Gamble. Classic sponsors are Apple Music, Bayern 3, Beats Electronics, EA Sports, Gigaset, Hugo Boss, Courtyard by Marriott, Veuve Clicquot, and Adelholzener.[193] In previous years the jersey rights were held by Adidas[194] (1974–78), Magirus Deutz and Iveco[195] (1978–84), Commodore[196] (1984–89) and Opel[197] (1989–2002).\n\n\nBayern is an exception in professional football, having generated profits for 27 consecutive years.[149] Other clubs often report losses, realising transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. In the 2019 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, Bayern had the fourth-highest revenue in club football, generating revenue of €629.2 million. Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. The top 20 European football clubs earned 43 per cent of revenue, on average, from broadcasting rights. Bayern earned the only 28 per cent of their revenue that way. Bayern had the second-highest commercial revenue in the 2019 Deloitte Football Money League, behind only Real Madrid. Bayern's commercial revenue was €348.7 million (55 per cent of total revenue). In contrast, Bayern's Matchday revenue trails other top clubs at €103.8 million (17 per cent of their total revenue).[198]\n\n\nWhile other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern had focused on Germany.[199] In recent years Bayern have started to focus their marketing more on Asia and the United States. Bayern made summer tours to the United States in 2014 and 2016. Bayern went to China in the summer of 2015 and returned in the summer of 2017 where they also played games in Singapore. In August 2014 Bayern opened an office in New York City as the club wants to strengthen their brand positioning against other top European clubs in the United States.[200] In March 2017, Bayern was the first foreign football club to open an office in mainland China. Bayern hope to attract new sponsors and to increase their merchandising sales. In 2017, Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fourth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club's value at €2.5 billion.[201]\n\n\nAs a result of Bayern's appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, the club's brand value has reached US$786 million, up 59 per cent from the previous year. Among European teams, this is ahead of Real Madrid's US$600 million and behind first-placed Manchester United, whose brand is valued at US$853 million. In 2013, Bayern overtook Manchester United to take first place in brand valuation.[202]\n\n\nBayern's financial report for the 2018–19 season reported revenue of €750.4 million and an operating profit of €146.1 million. Post-tax profits were €52.5 million which meant that this was Bayern's 27th consecutive year with a profit.[149]\n\n\nIn 2022, FC Bayern announced the opening of an international office in Bangkok; marking their third such branch office.[203]\n\n\n\n## Social engagement and charity[edit]\n\n\nBayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time, helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery. In the wake of the 2004 Tsunami the \"FC Bayern – Hilfe e.V.\" was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club.[204] At its inception this venture was funded with €600,000, raised by officials and players of the club.[205] The money was amongst other things used to build a school in Marathenkerny, Sri Lanka[205] and to rebuild the area of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. In April 2007 it was decided that the focus of the foundation would shift towards supporting people in need locally.[204]\n\n\nThe club has also assisted sport clubs in financial disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers.[206] Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its licence for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli.[207] More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club.[208] Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners.[209] In 2003, Bayern provided a €2 Million loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid.[210][211][212] On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.[213] On 30 August 2017, Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled Kickers Offenbach. All the revenue from the match went to Kickers Offenbach. Bayern's chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, \"Kickers Offenbach are a club with a rich tradition, they've always been an important club in Germany, so we'll gladly help them with a benefit match.\"[214] On 27 May 2019, Bayern played a benefit match against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. The match was played so Kaiserslautern could secure their licence to play in the German third division. All income from the match went to Kaiserslautern.[215] \"1. FC Kaiserslautern are one of Germany's biggest traditional clubs,\" Bayern's chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. \"For many years there were intense, and in retrospect also legendary, Bayern matches at Kaiserslautern. Football is all about emotions and sporting rivalries, but also about solidarity. That's why we're happy to help and hope 1. FC Kaiserslautern can once again gain promotion back to the Bundesliga in the foreseeable future.\"[216]\n\n\nIn mid 2013, Bayern was the first club to give financial support to the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation. The foundation researches the living environment LGBT people, and developed an education concept to facilitate unbiased dealing with LGBT themes in football.[217]\n\n\nIn 2016, FC Bayern received the Nine Values Cup, an award of the international children's social programme Football for Friendship.[218]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019/20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.[219]\n\n\n\n## Training facility[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Bayern Munich Headquarters\nFC Bayern Munich headquarters and training facility is called Säbener Straße and it is located in the Untergiesing-Harlaching borough of Munich. The first team and the reserve team train at the facility.[220] There are five grass pitches, two of which have undersoil heating, two artificial grass fields, a beach volleyball court and a multi-functional sports hall.[221]\n\n\n\n![](image)FC Bayern Football pitch (training only)\nThe players' quarters opened in 1990 and were reconstructed after the 2007–08 season on suggestions by then new coach, Jürgen Klinsmann, who took inspiration from various major sports clubs. The quarters are now called the performance centre and feature weights and fitness areas, a massage unit, dressing rooms, the coaches' office, and a conference room with screening facilities for video analysis. A café, a library, an e-Learning room, and a family room are also included.\n\n\nUntil August 2017, the Youth House was located at the headquarters at Säbener Straße. The Youth House housed up to 14 young talents aged 15 to 18 from outside of Munich. Former residents of the Youth House include Bastian Schweinsteiger, David Alaba, Owen Hargreaves, Michael Rensing, Holger Badstuber and Emre Can.\n\n\nIn 2006, Bayern purchased land near the Allianz Arena with the purpose of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started after overcoming internal resistance. The project's main reasons were that the existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at the senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at the youth level. The new facility was scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.[222] On 21 August 2017 the FC Bayern Campus opened at a cost of €70 million. The campus is located north of Munich at Ingolstädter Straße. The campus is 30 hectare and has 8 football pitches for youth teams from the U-9s to the U-19s and the women's and girls' teams. The campus also has a 2,500-capacity stadium where the U-17s and the U-19s play their matches. The Allianz FC Bayern Akademie is located on the campus site, and the academy has 35 apartments for young talents who don't live in the Greater Munich area. The academy building also has offices for youth coaches and staff.[223]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of FC Bayern Munich records and statistics § Honours\n\nBayern is historically the most successful team in German football, as they have won the most championships and the most cups. They are also Germany's most successful team in international competitions, having won fourteen trophies. Bayern is the only club to have won all three major European competitions, have won three consecutive European Cups and won the treble twice, one of which was part of the larger and more elusive \"sextuple\" (2020).\n\n\n\n![](image)The three consecutive European Cup trophies won by FC Bayern Munich from 1974 to 1976.

Udo Lattek, Giovanni Trapattoni and Ottmar Hitzfeld served two terms as head coach. Franz Beckenbauer served one term as head coach and one as caretaker, while Jupp Heynckes had four separate spells as coach, including one as caretaker.[232] Lattek was the club's most successful coach, having won six Bundesliga titles, two DFB Cups and the European Cup; following closely is Ottmar Hitzfeld, who won five Bundesliga titles, two DFB Cups and the Champions League. The club's least successful coach was Søren Lerby, who won less than a third of his matches in charge and presided over the club's near-relegation in the 1991–92 campaign.\n\n\nOn 3 November 2019, Bayern sacked Niko Kovač after a 5–1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt and appointed Hansi Flick as a coach. Initially, Flick was installed as caretaker coach only, however on 15 November, after Flick's team had won 4–0 against Borussia Dortmund, Bayern announced that Flick would be in charge at least until Christmas 2019.[233] Later on, Flick signed a new contract until 2023.[99]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Coach\n | Period\n | MajorTitles\n | Domestic\n | European\n | Worldwide\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |

reserve team serves mainly as the final stepping stone for promising young players before being promoted to the main team. The second team is coached by Sebastian Hoeneß.[238] The second team play in the 3. Liga for the 2019–20 season. Since the inception of the Regionalliga in 1994, the team played in the Regionalliga Süd, after playing in the Oberliga since 1978. In the 2007–08 season, they qualified for the newly founded 3. Liga, where they lasted until 2011 when they were relegated to the Regionalliga. This ended 33 consecutive years of playing in the highest league that the German Football Association permits the second team of a professional football team to play.[45][239]\n\n\n\n#### Junior teams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The FC Bayern Academy at the campus in Munich\nMain article: FC Bayern Campus\n\nMain article: FC Bayern Munich Junior Team\n\nThe youth academy has produced some of Europe's top football players, including Thomas Hitzlsperger, Owen Hargreaves, Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Müller. On 1 August 2017, the FC Bayern Campus became the new home of the youth teams. It consists of ten teams, with the youngest being under 9.[240][241] Jochen Sauer is the FC Bayern Campus director and Bayern legend coach Hermann Gerland is the sporting director.\n\n\n\n#### Women's team[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FC Bayern Munich (women)\n\nThe women's football department consists of five teams, including a professional team, a reserve team, and two youth teams. The women's first team, which is led by head coach Thomas Wörle, features several members of the German national youth team. In the 2008–09 season, the team finished second in the women's Bundesliga. The division was founded in 1970 and consisted of four teams with 90 players. Their greatest successes were winning the championships in 1976, 2015, and 2016.[242] In the 2011–12 season on 12 May 2012, FC Bayern Munich dethroned the German Cup title holders 1. FFC Frankfurt with a 2–0 in the 2011–12 final in Cologne and celebrated the biggest success of the club's history since winning the championship in 1976. In 2015 they won the Bundesliga for the first time, without any defeat. They won the 2015–16 Bundesliga for the second consecutive time.[243]\n\n\n\n#### Senior football[edit]\n\n\nThe senior football department was founded in 2002, making it the youngest division of the club, and consists of five teams.

Although the talks came to nothing, the ice hockey department of Münchner Eislauf Verein decided to join Bayern –mid-season– in January 1966. The team finished the season under the name of Bayern Munich in third place of the second-tier Oberliga. The following season Bayern achieved promotion to the Bundesliga where the club stayed for two seasons. However, in 1969 the club disbanded the department and sold the hockey team to Augsburger EV, citing lack of local support and difficulty in recruiting players as reasons.[258]\n\n\n\n#### Gymnastics[edit]\n\n\nThe gymnastics department was founded in 1974 and was most successful in the 1980s. During this time, the team won four German championships in 1983, 1986, 1987, and 1988. In 2014, the division was dissolved.\n\n\n\n## Literature[edit]\n\n\n* Hüetlin, Thomas: *Gute Freunde.
