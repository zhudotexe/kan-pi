Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men \u2013 Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Everson, William K.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Gray, Brandon. \"'Avatar' Claims Highest Gross of All Time\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established\n | Title\n | Record-setting gross\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915[64] | *The Birth of a Nation* | $5,200,000R | [# 85] |\n| *1940* | $15,000,000R \u2021 | [# 309] |\n| 1940[32] | *Gone with the Wind* | $32,000,000R | [# 135] |\n| *1963* | $67,000,000R \u2021 | [# 310] |\n| 1966[64] | *The Sound of Music* | $114,600,000R | [# 210] |\n| 1971[64] | *Gone with the Wind* | $116,000,000R \u2021 | [# 311] |\n| 1972[64] | *The Godfather* | $127,600,000\u2013142,000,000R | [# 236][# 312] |\n| 1976[87][88] | *Jaws* | $193,700,000R | [# 251] |\n| 1978[89][90] | *Star Wars* | $410,000,000/$268,500,000R | [# 313][# 236] |\n| *1982* | $530,000,000 \u2021 | [# 257] |\n| 1983[91] | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $619,000,000\u2013664,000,000\n | [# 257][# 270] |\n| *1993* | $701,000,000 \u2021 | [# 314] |\n| 1993[64] | *Jurassic Park* | $912,667,947\n | [# 73] |\n| 1998[92] | *Titanic* | $1,843,373,318\n | [# 7] |\n| 2010[93][94] | *Avatar* | $2,743,577,587\n | [# 1] |\n| $2,788,416,135 \u2021 |\n| 2019[95][96] | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** Hall & Neale 2010, p.\u00a0145. \"The commercial success of the five Cinerama travelogues, which earned an aggregate worldwide box-office gross of $120\u00a0million by 1962 (including $82\u00a0million in the United States and Canada), nevertheless demonstrated to the mainstream industry the market value of special screen formats.\"\n64. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Dirks, Tim. \"Top Films of All-Time: Part 1\u00a0\u2013 Box-Office Blockbusters\".

The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently.

recruitment,[74] and at one point *Variety* estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50\u00a0million.[75] Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated.[65] While it is generally accepted that *Gone with the Wind* took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release\u2014which is true in terms of public exhibition\u2014it is likely it did not overtake *The Birth of a Nation* in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s.[73] *Gone with the Wind* itself may have been briefly overtaken by *The Ten Commandments* (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58\u201360\u00a0million[76][77] compared to *Gone with the

grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box-office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media.[30] Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals.[26] As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a \"top film of all time\",[24][31] so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe is also the highest-grossing franchise, amassing over $29\u00a0billion at the box office.\n\n\nThe *Spider-Man* films are the highest-grossing series based on a single property, earning over $10.5\u00a0billion at the box office (although the Eon *James Bond* films have earned over $19\u00a0billion in total when adjusted to current prices).[a] If ancillary income from merchandise is included, then *Star Wars* is the most lucrative property;[112] it holds the *Guinness* world record for the \"most successful film merchandising franchise\" and was valued at \u00a319.51\u00a0billion (about $31\u00a0billion) in 2012.[113][114] The Marvel Cinematic Universe has had the most films gross over $1\u00a0billion, with ten. The four *Avengers* films, the two *Frozen* films, and the two *Avatar* films are the only franchises where each installment has grossed over $1\u00a0billion, although the *Jurassic Park* and *Black Panther* series have averaged over $1\u00a0billion per film.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A screencap of the title card from the trailer of Gone with the Wind.](image)*Gone with the Wind* held the record of highest-grossing film for twenty-five years and, adjusted for inflation, has earned more than any other film.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** \"*Titanic* sinks competitors without a trace\". *BBC News*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnother film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film *Deep Throat*. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $600\u00a0million;[82] this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than *Star Wars*, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1989 | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | $474,171,806\u2013494,000,000 | $36,000,000\u201355,400,000 | [# 283][# 274][# 284] |\n| 1990 | *Ghost* | $505,870,681 ($505,702,588)\n | $22,000,000 | [# 285][# 274] |\n| 1991 | *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* | $523,774,456 ($519,843,345)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 286][# 287] |\n| 1992 | *Aladdin* | $504,050,219 | $28,000,000 | [# 288][# 146] |\n| 1993 | *Jurassic Park* | $1,037,535,230 ($912,667,947)\n | $63,000,000\u201370,000,000 | [# 73] |\n| 1994 | *The Lion King* | $968,511,805 ($763,455,561)\n | $45,000,000\u201379,300,000 | [# 289] |\n| 1995 | *Toy Story* | $373,554,033 ($364,873,776)\n | $30,000,000 | [# 290][# 291] |\n| *Die Hard with a Vengeance* | $366,101,666 | $70,000,000 | [# 292][# 293] |\n| 1996 | *Independence Day* | $817,400,891 | $75,000,000 | [# 294] |\n| 1997 | *Titanic* | $2,257,844,554 ($1,843,373,318)\n | $200,000,000 | [# 7] |\n| 1998 | *Armageddon* | $553,709,788 | $140,000,000 | [# 295][# 296] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

It is the first installment in the *Avatar* film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Avatar* began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film *Titanic*, for a planned release in 1999;[13] however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14] Work on the language of the Na'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[15][16] *Avatar* was officially budgeted at $237\u00a0million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.[4] Other estimates put the cost at between $280\u00a0million and $310\u00a0million for production and at $150\u00a0million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and \"4D\" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.[20]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions[26] and caused 3D films[27] to increase in popularity. Its success led to the *Avatar* franchise, which includes the sequels *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022), *Avatar 3* (2025), *Avatar 4* (2029), and *Avatar 5* (2031).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted and is suffering ecocide.[28] The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0\u00a0m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\n\n\nWhile escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife, and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\n\n\nJake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred Tree of Souls, Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\n\n\nThe Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fictional universe of Avatar\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSam Worthington (*left*) and Zoe Salda\u00f1a (*right*), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n* Sam Worthington as Corporal Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down.[29] Worthington, who was living in his car at the time,[30] auditioned twice early in development,[11][*failed verification*] and he has signed on for possible sequels.[31] Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character \"a quality that is really real\". Cameron said he \"has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world\".[32][*failed verification*] Cameron offered the role to Matt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment to the *Bourne* film series.[33]\n\t+ Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Tommy.\n* Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite, the daughter of the leaders of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naivet\u00e9 and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.[34] The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated.[35] Salda\u00f1a signed on for potential sequels.[36]\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for *Avatar*.[37] Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in *Aliens*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron[38] but was ultimately not cast.\n* Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chac\u00f3n, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in *Girlfight*.[37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation.[39][40][41] While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist[42] who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program.[43] He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar.

Rider Haggard.[11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old. He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that would lit up when someone stepped on it. When he woke up he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie.[47] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing *Titanic*, he would film *Avatar*, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors.[14] The project would cost $100\u00a0million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\".[48] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10\u00a0million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for *Avatar*, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[49]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film *Project 880* was \"a retooled version of *Avatar*\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[50] citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones.[11] Cameron had chosen *Avatar* over his project *Battle Angel* after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[51]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC.[11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo M\u0101ori.[16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[52]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[53] often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home.[54] In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would film *Avatar* for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[55] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce *Avatar*.[56] Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined *Avatar* to help with the film's designs.[57] Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors.[58] In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[59]\n\n\nWhile these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to *Avatar* because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, *Titanic*. During the production of *Titanic*, Cameron rewrote the script to streamline the plot by combining several characters' roles and offered to cut his fee if the film were a commercial disappointment.[49] Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[49] In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\" so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook.[49] However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal.[49] In October 2006, Fox finally agreed to commit to making *Avatar* after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237\u00a0million budget.[49] After Fox accepted *Avatar*, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you *can* do this\u00a0...\"[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External audio |\n| --- |\n| James Cameron interviewed by F. X. Feeney on writing Avatar. |\n| ![audio icon](image) Interview[61] |\n\n\nIn December 2006, Cameron described *Avatar* as \"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200\u00a0years hence\u00a0... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\".[62] The January 2007 press release described the film as \"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\" and said the story is of \"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.[36]\n\n\nEstimates put the cost of the film at about $280\u2013310\u00a0million to produce and an estimated $150\u00a0million for marketing, noting that about $30\u00a0million in tax credits would lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.[17][18][19] A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \"$237\u00a0million, with $150\u00a0million for promotion, end of story.\"[4]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Avatar* began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[63] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[64] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for *Avatar* would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[65] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[66]\n\n\nMotion-capture photography lasted 31\u00a0days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles.[51][67] Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days.[68] More than a thousand people worked on the production.[67] In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[69] Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests[70] to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[69]\n\n\nDuring filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\"[71] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[72] Cameron described the system as a \"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\".[73]\n\n\nCameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology.[62] Spielberg said, \"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation\u00a0... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\"[72] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[74]\n\n\nTo film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \"simulcam\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[69]\n\n\nDue to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.[75]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![The left image shows the blue cat-like alien Neyitiri shouting. The right image shows the actress who portrays her, Zoe Saldana, with motion-capture dots across her face and a small camera in front of her eyes.](image)Cameron pioneered a specially designed camera built into a 6-inch boom that allowed the facial expressions of the actors to be captured and digitally recorded for the animators to use later.[76]\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film.[13][14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.[71]\n\n\nInnovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle,[77] a motion-capture stage or \"volume\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers.[78] According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.[79]\nBesides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance.[80] A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.[81]\n\n\nThe lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[82] Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for *Avatar*, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[83] To render *Avatar*, Weta used a 930\u00a0m2 (10,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system.[84][85][86][87] The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta.[88][89] Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage,[90] and each minute of the final footage for *Avatar* occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage.[91] It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[92] To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[93] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[94]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n![](image)\n\nJames Horner\u00a0\u2013 \"Jake Enters His Avatar World\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of the 2009 film *Avatar*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after *Aliens* and *Titanic*.[95] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008.[96]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.[97]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009.[98] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for *Avatar* and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.[69]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace.[100]\n\n\n\n## Themes and inspirations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Themes in *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology.[101]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' *John Carter* series.[11] He acknowledged that *Avatar* shares themes with the films *At Play in the Fields of the Lord*, *The Emerald Forest*, and *Princess Mononoke*, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with *Dances with Wolves*, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.[102][103] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[103]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to \"describe in great detail the\ngenesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be *Avatar*.\"[104] In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between *Avatar* and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for *Xenogenesis*, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in *Avatar*. He stated that *Avatar*'s \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including *Aliens*, *The Abyss*, *Rambo: First Blood Part II*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. He specifically mentioned the \"water tentacle\" in *The Abyss* as an example of an \"avatar\" that \"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.\"[105]\n\n\nCameron also cited a number of works by other creators as \"reference points and sources of inspiration\" for *Avatar*. These include two of his \"favorite\" films, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and *Lawrence of Arabia*, where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story \"In the Imagicon\" and Arthur C. Clarke's novel *The City and the Stars*. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the cyberpunk novels *Neuromancer* by William Gibson and *Islands in the Net* by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including *Dances with Wolves*, *The Man Who Would Be King*, *The Mission*, *The Emerald Forest*, *Medicine Man*, *The Jungle Book* and *FernGully*. He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.[105]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with *Time* magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term *Avatar*, to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\"[10] Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime *Ghost in the Shell*, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[106][107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.[101]\nThe look of the Na'vi\u00a0\u2013 the humanoids indigenous to Pandora\u00a0\u2013 was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on *Avatar*. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\".[101] Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color\u00a0... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,[108] which I like conceptually.\"[109] He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.[101]\n\n\nFor the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, which he said was in the tradition of *Romeo and Juliet*.[105] He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film *Titanic*. An interviewer stated: \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\"[110] Cameron described Neytiri as his \"Pocahontas\", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a \"white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.\"[105] Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists.[111] Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.[110]\n\n\n\n![A gray mountain in the middle of a forest.](image)Pandora's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\" were inspired in part by the Chinese Huangshan mountains (pictured).[112]\n![](image)Zhangjiajie National Forest Park\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\"[113] According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world.[113] Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.[114]\n\n\nTo create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the *Noble Clyde Boudreaux*[115] oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.[116]\n\n\nCameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".[117]\n\n\nCameron acknowledges that *Avatar* implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\"[118] He said in later interviews, \"...\u00a0I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled\u00a0...\"[119] and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"[120]\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September\u00a011 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotions[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con promoting Avatar.](image)Cameron promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009,[121] and *Empire* released exclusive images from the film in its October issue.[122] Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel, moderated by Tom Rothman, at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con on July 23. Twenty-five minutes of footage was screened[123] in Dolby 3D.[124]\nWeaver and Cameron appeared at additional panels to promote the film, speaking on the 23rd[125] and 24th[126][127] respectively. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con *Avatar* Panel that August 21 will be '*Avatar* Day'. On this day, the trailer was released in all theatrical formats. The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day.[128]\n\n\nThe 129-second trailer was released online on August 20, 2009.[129]\nThe new 210-second trailer was premiered in theaters on October 23, 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on October 29, 2009, to positive reviews.[130][131]\nAn extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews.[129] *The Hollywood Reporter* said that audience expectations were colored by \"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded *Titanic*\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling.[132] The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4\u00a0million views.[133]\nOn October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of *Avatar* to a number of press.[134] The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on November 1, 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.[135]\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology.[136] The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox series *Bones* in the episode \"The Gamer In The Grease\" (Season 5, Episode 9). *Avatar* star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film.[137] A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim, when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost.[138] McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \"Avatarize yourself\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.[139]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora*, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released by Harper Entertainment on November 24, 2009.[140]\nIt is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page *James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook* for children.[141] *The Art of Avatar* was released on November 30, 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface.[142] In October 2010, Abrams Books also released *The Making of Avatar*, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.[143]\n\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of *Avatar* after the film was released.[144] In February 2010, producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for *Avatar* that will \"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\", saying that \"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\".[145] In August 2013, it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the *Avatar* universe.[146]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Game* and *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an *Avatar* game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film.[147] *Avatar: The Game* was released on December 1, 2009,[148] for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and December 8 for PlayStation Portable. A second game, *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*, was under development as of 2021.\n\n\n\n### Action figures and postage stamps[edit]\n\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of *Avatar* action figures.[149][150]\nEach action figure will be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is exclusive to each specific action figure.[149] A series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.[151]\n\n\nIn December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on *Avatar*, coinciding with the film's worldwide release.[152]\n\n\n\n## Releases[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18.[153] The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming[154] but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November)[77] and give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors.[155] Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings.[156][157] However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e., screens that increase in width to display 2.39:1 films).[158] During a 3D preview showing in Germany on December 16, the movie's DRM \"protection\" system malfunctioned, and some copies delivered weren't watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere.[159]\n\n\n*Avatar* was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters showed it in 3D. In total, 90% of all advance ticket sales for *Avatar* were for 3D screenings.[160]\n\n\nInternationally, *Avatar* opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross).[161][162] The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on December 18. The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[163] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[164] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released *Avatar* in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".[20]\n\n\n\n#### Post-original release[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D.[165] *Avatar: Special Edition* includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG,[166] including an extension of the sex scene[167] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film.[166] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n*Avatar* was rereleased in theaters on September 23, 2022, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures for a limited two-week engagement, with the film being remastered in 4K high-dynamic range, with select scenes at a high frame rate of 48 fps.[169] The reissue was prior to the December 2022 premiere of its sequel, *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[170] Prior to this, Cameron previously teased a re-release of the film back in 2017 when promoting the Dolby Cinema re-release of *Titanic*, stating that there were plans in the works to remaster the film with Dolby Vision and re-release it in Dolby Cinema.[171]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on April 22, 2010,[172] and in the UK on April 26.[173] The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day.[174] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's 1.78:1 (16:9) format over the 2.39:1 (21:9) scope version as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film.[175] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update.[176][177]\n\n\n*Avatar* set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by *The Dark Knight* (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold.[178] In its first four days of release, sales of *Avatar* on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada\u00a0\u2013 overtaking *The Dark Knight* to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region.[179][180] The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week.[181] In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of 19.7 million DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period.[182] As of July 18, 2012, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 10.5 million units sold with $190,806,055 in revenue.[183] *Avatar* retained its record as the top-selling Blu-ray in the US market until January 2015, when it was surpassed by Disney's *Frozen*.[184]\n\n\nThe *Avatar* three-disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 16, 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut (162 minutes), the special edition cut (170 minutes), and a collector's extended cut (178 minutes). The DVD set spreads the film across two discs, while the Blu-ray set presents it on a single disc.[185] The collector's extended cut contains eight more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\". He stated the \"Earth opening\" is an additional 4+1\u20442 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release.[186] The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.[185]\n\n\nCameron initially stated that *Avatar* would be released in 3D around November 2010, but the studio issued a correction: \"3-D is in the conceptual stage and *Avatar* will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November.\"[187] In May 2010, Fox stated that the 3D version would be released some time in 2011.[182] It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV. The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until February 2012.[188] On October 2010, Cameron stated that the standalone 3D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was \"maybe one, two years out\".[189] On Christmas Eve 2010, *Avatar* had its 3D television world premiere on Sky.[190][191][192]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2012, Cameron announced on Facebook that *Avatar* would be released globally on Blu-ray 3D.[193] The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.[194]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Avatar* on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 20, 2023.[195] Disney will re-release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[196]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 335 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.4 out of ten. The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but *Avatar* reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\"[197] On Metacritic\u2014which assigns a weighted mean score\u2014the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D.[199]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film \"extraordinary\", and gave it four stars out of four. \"Watching *Avatar*, I felt sort of the same as when I saw *Star Wars* in 1977,\" he said, adding that like *Star Wars* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the film \"employs a new generation of special effects\" and it \"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\".[200]\nA. O. Scott of *At The Movies* also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed *Star Wars* and he said \"although the script is a little bit\u00a0... obvious,\" it was \"part of what made it work\".[201][202] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised the film, saying: \"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in *Avatar*, and it's very much a place worth visiting.\"[203] Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the film a positive review. \"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\" he stated.[204] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* awarded *Avatar* a three-and-a-half out of four star rating, and wrote in his print review: \"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\"[205] Richard Corliss of *Time* thought that the film was \"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\"[206] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* thought the film has \"powerful\" visual accomplishments but \"flat dialogue\" and \"obvious characterization\".[207] James Berardinelli of *ReelViews* praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote: \"In 3-D, it's immersive\u00a0\u2013 but the traditional film elements\u00a0\u2013 story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.\u00a0\u2013 are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2+1\u20442-hour experience.\"[208]\n\n\n*Avatar*'s underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the *New York Press* wrote that Cameron used \"villainous American characters\" to \"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\".[209][210] Russell D. Moore of *The Christian Post* concluded that \"propaganda exists in the film\" and stated \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\"[211] Adam Cohen of *The New York Times* was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\".[212] Ross Douthat of *The New York Times* opined that the film is \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism\u00a0[...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\",[213] while Saritha Prabhu of *The Tennessean* called the film a \"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\",[214] and Maxim Osipov of *The Hindustan Times*, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the *Bhagavad Gita*.[215] Annalee Newitz of *io9* concluded that *Avatar* is another film that has the recurring \"fantasy about race\" whereby \"some white guy\" becomes the \"most awesome\" member of a non-white culture.[216] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune* called *Avatar* \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\",[217] while Miranda Devine of *The Sydney Morning Herald* thought that \"It [was] impossible to watch *Avatar* without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\"[218] Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to *Avatar*'s success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\".[219]\n\n\nCritics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \"borrowing\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of *The Boston Globe* called it \"the same movie\" as *Dances with Wolves*.[220] Like *Dances with Wolves*, *Avatar* has been characterized as being a \"white savior\" movie, in which a \"backwards\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture.[221][222] Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette \"Call Me Joe\", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter.[223][224] Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that *Avatar* has elements in common with the 1960s *Noon Universe* novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave.[225] Various reviews have compared *Avatar* to the films *FernGully: The Last Rainforest*,[226][227] *Pocahontas*[228] and *The Last Samurai.*[229] NPR's *Morning Edition* has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that *Avatar* was made by \"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\".[230] Gary Westfahl wrote that \"the science fiction story that most closely resembles *Avatar* has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella *The Word for World Is Forest* (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook\".[224] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \"mash-up\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, *Midworld*.[231] Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which features fantastic images of dragons and floating rock formations.[232][233] In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m.[234] Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and *The Hollywood Reporter* noted that Cameron had won multiple *Avatar* idea theft cases.[235]\n\n\n*Avatar* received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as \"the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since *Star Wars*\" and others calling it \"audacious and awe inspiring\", \"master class\", and \"brilliant\". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film.[236] On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \"It's not in my top three James Cameron films.\u00a0... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\".[237] For French filmmaker Luc Besson, *Avatar* opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series *Val\u00e9rian and Laureline* that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film.[238] *TIME* ranked *Avatar* number 3 in their list of \"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\"[239] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-Time 100 list,[240] and IGN listed *Avatar* as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.[241]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n#### General[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens.[242] It grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada, with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens.[243] The film grossed $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind *I Am Legend*,[22][5] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping *The Incredibles*), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking *Up*'s record),[244] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking *The Day After Tomorrow*'s record),[245] and the 40th-largest opening weekend in North America,[5] despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results.[17][22][23] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5\u00a0million, 12% of the film's $77\u00a0million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.[163]\n\n\nInternational markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10\u00a0million were for Russia ($19.7\u00a0million), France ($17.4\u00a0million), the UK ($13.8\u00a0million), Germany ($13.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($11.7\u00a0million), Australia ($11.5\u00a0million), and Spain ($11.0\u00a0million).[5] *Avatar*'s worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film.[246] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1\u00a0million during the opening weekend.[163]\n\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence,[247] grossing $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office[248] and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time.[249] The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[250] to set a third-weekend record.[251]\n\n\n*Avatar* crossed the $1\u00a0billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days.[252] It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so.[253] In its fourth weekend, *Avatar* continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217,[254] and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States, beating *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen*.[247] In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446,[255] and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612.[256] It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records grossing $34,944,081[257] and $31,280,029[258] respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.[259]\n\n\nOn January 31, it became the first film to gross over $2 billion worldwide,[260] and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in the U.S. and Canada, on February 27, after 72 days of release.[261] It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks\u00a0\u2013 the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since *Titanic* spent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998[262]\u00a0\u2013 and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*.[263] By the end of its first theatrical release *Avatar* had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328.[5]\n\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of *Avatar* featuring extended footage, *Avatar* grossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5] *Avatar* has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed *Titanic*'s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release,[264][265][266] just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[267] On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, *Avatar* surpassed *Titanic* to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States.[268] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[269][270][271][272][273][274] and is the first film to gross over $2\u00a0billion in foreign box office receipts.[275]\nIMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross,[276] more than double the previous record.[277] By 2022, this figure rose to $268.6 million.[278]\n\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, *Avatar* would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[279] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on *Avatar*'s gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that *Avatar* had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace*.[280] On a worldwide basis, when *Avatar*'s gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, *The Daily Telegraph* estimated its gross was surpassed by only *Gone with the Wind* ($3.0 billion), *Titanic* ($2.9 billion), and *Star Wars* ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[281] with *Avatar* ultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5] Reuters even placed it ahead of *Titanic* after adjusting the global total for inflation.[282] The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind *Gone with the Wind* in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[283][284]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster *Titanic*.[285][286][287] This criticism ranged from *Avatar*'s film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\".[285][286] *Slate* magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the *Star Wars* prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect.[288] *The New York Times* noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release *Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel* alongside *Avatar*, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office.[289]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation\u00a0... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on criticism of *Avatar* before its release.[286]\n\nBox office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success.[285][290] \"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for *Avatar.* This is the one. The behemoth.\"[290] The \"cautionary estimate\" was that *Avatar* would bring in around $60\u00a0million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher.[290][291] There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.[285]\n\n\nCameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\" he stated. \"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\"[286] Although he felt *Avatar* would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic,[286] he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\"[292] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that *Avatar* would need significant \"repeat business\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed *Avatar* could inspire the same \"sharing\" reaction as *Titanic*. He said that film worked because, \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing *Titanic*'s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.[293] Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing *Titanic*, such as 2008's *The Dark Knight*,[294] but *Avatar* was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings[293] did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\"[295] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing *Titanic* because \"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when *Titanic* was released.\"[295] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[297]\n\n\n\n> \n> You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, the Tolkiens and the Star Wars and the Star Treks. People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. Like Pandora.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on the success of *Avatar*[298]\n\nAlthough analysts have been unable to agree that *Avatar*'s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\", and this also applied to 2010.[299]\nCameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.[286] *Titanic* capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.[299] Additionally, *Avatar* established itself as a \"must-see\" event. Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see *Avatar* are going to see *Avatar* and would even if the slate was strong.\"[299] Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. \"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.[299] The \"Oscar buzz\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly\u00a0...*Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\", and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than before.[299]\n\n\nAccording to *Variety*, films in 3D accumulated $1.3\u00a0billion in 2009, \"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\". The increased ticket price\u00a0\u2013 an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets\u00a0\u2013 helped the film.[299] Likewise, *Entertainment Weekly* attributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[300] Gray said *Avatar* having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: *Titanic* (historical events), the *Star Wars* movies (an established film franchise), or *The Lord of the Rings* (literature). It was a tougher sell\u00a0...\"[299] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.[302] *Avatar* also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others.[303] At the 36th Saturn Awards, *Avatar* won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\nThe New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award.[304] The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations.[305] It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film.[306] The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for six others, including Best Film and Director.[307] The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned *Avatar*'s cultural impact.[b] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast. Mendelson argued *Avatar*'s only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\"[308] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made *Avatar* sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\"[314]\n\n\nSome have questioned if there is an audience for the film's planned sequels, believing there to be a lack of interest in the face of the multiple delays of their release dates.[311][312][315] Writing for *The Escapist*, Darren Mooney acknowledged that the film had not been broadly remembered in the pop cultural subconscious and had not found a fandom in the same sense as many other popular media, but argued that this was not a negative point, saying, \"its defining legacy is the insistence that it lacks a legacy.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the trailer for *Avatar*'s upcoming sequel and the film's re-release, journalists again questioned the cultural relevance of the film, particularly Patrick Ryan of *USA Today*, who said the film had \"curiously left almost no pop-culture footprint\".[317][318] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called others' opinions that the film had left no cultural impact \"narrow-minded\" and said that the film still held up well.[319] A detailed overview of the *Avatar* franchise was reported in *The New York Times* in December of that year.[320]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Way of Water*, *Avatar 3*, and *Avatar 4*\n\nSee also: *Avatar* (franchise)\n\n*Avatar*'s success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four.[321] *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) grossed over $2.3\u00a0billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022,[322] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response.[323] It will be followed by *Avatar 3* (2025). Fourth and fifth *Avatar* films, titled *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031.[321][324]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toruk \u2013 The First Flight\n\n*Toruk \u2013 The First Flight* is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil which ran between December 2015 and June 2019. Inspired by *Avatar*, the story is set in Pandora's past, involving a prophecy concerning a threat to the Tree of Souls and a quest for totems from different tribes. Audience members could download an app in order to participate in show effects. On January 18, 2016, it was announced via the Toruk Facebook page that filming for a DVD release had been completed and was undergoing editing.[325]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attraction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar\n\nIn 2011, Cameron, Lightstorm, and Fox entered an exclusive licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company to feature *Avatar*-themed attractions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide, including a themed land for Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The area, known as Pandora \u2013 The World of *Avatar*, opened on May 27, 2017.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Avatar*, Cameron planned to write a novel based on the film, \"telling the story of the movie, but [going] into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with.\"[328] In 2013, this plan was superseded by the announcement of four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe\", to be written by Steven Gould.[146] The books were due to be published by Penguin Random House, although since 2017, there has been no update on the planned book series.[329]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)science fiction portal\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* *Red Scorpion*\n* *Run of the Arrow*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[7][8][9]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[308][309][310][311][312][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** LaFraniere, Sharon (January 29, 2010). \"China's Zeal for 'Avatar' Crowds Out 'Confucius'\". *The New York Times*.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell\u2014it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves\u2014again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15\u00a0million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77\u201378% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8\u00a0million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799\u00a0billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2\u00a0billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640\u00a0million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2\u00a0billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5\u00a0billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120\u2013140\u00a0million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5\u00a0million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200\u2013250\u00a0million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260\u2013300\u00a0million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260\u2013270\u00a0million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300\u00a0million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1\u00a0million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100\u00a0million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5\u00a0million, including $60\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3\u00a0million), and Sunday ($90.4\u00a0million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314\u00a0million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9\u00a0million on Monday and $33.1\u00a0million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4\u00a0million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3\u00a0million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600\u00a0million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8\u00a0million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700\u00a0million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2\u00a0million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3\u00a0million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800\u00a0million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1\u00a0million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2\u00a0million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680\u00a0million over its first five days for a global debut of $850\u2013950\u00a0million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250\u2013280\u00a0million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5\u00a0million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2\u00a0million (RMB 189\u00a0million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1\u00a0million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300\u00a0million.[163] Overall, the film made $169\u00a0million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9\u00a0million), South Korea ($8.4\u00a0million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1\u00a0million), France ($6\u00a0million), and Italy ($5.8\u00a0million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866\u00a0million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5\u00a0million; RMB 2.22\u00a0billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($47.4\u00a0million), Mexico ($33.1\u00a0million), Australia ($30.8\u00a0million), Brazil ($26\u00a0million), Spain ($13.3\u00a0million), Japan ($13\u00a0million),[152] and Vietnam ($10\u00a0million).[180] It also made $21.6\u00a0million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($68.2\u00a0million), South Korea ($60.3\u00a0million), Mexico ($48.6\u00a0million), and India ($40.9\u00a0million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569\u00a0billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January\u00a02021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632\u00a0million), United Kingdom ($115\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million), Brazil ($86\u00a0million), and Mexico ($78\u00a0million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clich\u00e9d time travel plot \u2013 the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to *Avatar* (2009) and the second installment in the *Avatar* film series. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role,[6] while Kate Winslet joined the cast. It follows a blue-skinned humanoid Na'vi named Jake Sully (Worthington) as he and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan of Pandora, a habitable exomoon on which they live.\n\n\nCameron said in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to *Avatar* if it were successful, and he announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five *Avatar* films, and the necessity to develop new technology to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction, and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with a currently untitled third film, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington on September 25, 2017, which ended in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350\u2013460\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\nAfter repeated delays in the expected release schedule, *Avatar: The Way of Water* premiered at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on December 6, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 16. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the plot and lengthy runtime.[10] It was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing over $2.320\u00a0billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *The Way of Water* one of the top-ten films of 2022. Among its many accolades, the film was nominated for four awards at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Visual Effects. Three further sequels are in production, with the next film set to be released in December 2025.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nSixteen years after the Na'vi repelled the RDA invasion of Pandora,[a] Jake Sully lives as chief of the Omatikaya clan and raises a family with Neytiri, which includes sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, daughter Tuk, and adopted daughter Kiri (born from Grace Augustine's inert avatar). Spider, the Pandora-born human son of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch, frequently visits their children while being raised by the scientists who stayed on Pandora. To the Na'vi's dismay, the RDA, led by its new leader, Frances Ardmore, returns to colonize Pandora. Among the new arrivals are Recombinants, Na'vi avatars implanted with the memories of deceased human soldiers. Quaritch's Recombinant serves as their leader.\n\n\nA year later, Jake leads a guerilla campaign against the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission, Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free them, but Spider is captured by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. After the RDA fails to get information from Spider, Quaritch decides to spend time with his son to draw him to his side. In turn, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language.\n\n\nAware of the danger posed by Spider's knowledge of his whereabouts, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omatikaya and retreat to Pandora's eastern sea, where the Metkayina clan gives them refuge. There, the family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea, and Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, the daughter of Chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal.\n\n\nAfter defending Kiri against Tonowari's son Aonung, Lo'ak apologizes at Jake's insistence. Aonung and his friends then entice Lo'ak to a trip into a sea predator's territory and leave him stranded. Lo'ak is saved from the predator and befriended by Payakan, a Tulkun\u2014an intelligent and pacifist whale-like species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual brethren. Upon his return, Lo'ak wins Aonung's friendship by taking the blame for the trip but is told that Payakan is an outcast among the Tulkun.\n\n\nLater, Kiri links to the Metkayina's underwater Spirit Tree and, in a vision, meets her biological mother, Grace, whose consciousness lives within Pandora. Kiri suffers a seizure during the link-induced trance and nearly drowns.\n\n\nJake summons Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help. They diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that she cannot connect to the Spirit Tree again, as doing so may kill her. Although Ronal saves Kiri, Quaritch tracks Norm and Max's aircraft to the archipelago where the Metkayina live. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch joins forces with the RDA's marine operations, led by Captain Mick Scoresby, and commandeers a whaling vessel that hunts Tulkuns to extract anti-aging serums called amrita.\n\n\nQuaritch's squad raids the archipelago, interrogating the tribes about Jake's location to no avail. Quaritch then orders the whalers to kill Tulkuns near the villages to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns that he was cast out because he went against the pacifist ways of his species and attacked the whalers who killed his mother, causing many deaths.\n\n\nWhen the Metkayina learns of the Tulkun killings, Lo'ak rushes off to warn Payakan, followed by his siblings and friends. They find Payakan being hunted, and Quaritch captures Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Tuk. Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina set out to confront the humans and rescue the kids. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but Payakan attacks the whalers, triggering a fight between the Metkayina and the humans. Spider cripples the vessel, and Neteyam rescues Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider but is fatally shot by one of Quaritch's men. Jake and Neytiri return to save their remaining children, who were recaptured. Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage. When Neytiri does the same with Spider, Quaritch initially denies their relationship but desists once Neytiri cuts Spider. Jake, Quaritch, Neytiri, and Tuk are trapped inside the sinking vessel. After a tense skirmish, Jake strangles Quaritch unconscious and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, while Kiri recovers Neytiri and Tuk. Spider rescues Quaritch but refuses to go with him and rejoins Jake's family.\n\n\nAfter Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari of his decision to leave the Metkayina. Still, the chief respectfully identifies Jake as part of the clan and welcomes him and his family to stay. Jake and his family accept their new lives at sea but vow to resume their campaign against the RDA.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Sam Worthington, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, James Cameron, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang at the press conference in Tokyo.\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former human who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'vi after becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become Na'vi and is now chief of the Omatikaya.[11][12]\n* Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite (Neytiri Sully), the daughter of the previous clan chief, future Tsah\u00eck of the clan, and Jake's mate.[11][12]\n* Sigourney Weaver as Kiri te Suli Kireysi'ite (Kiri Sully), the 14-year-old daughter of Dr. Grace Augustine's Na'vi avatar who was adopted by Jake and Neytiri.[13] Weaver originally appeared in the first film as Dr. Grace Augustine, a human scientist who took the side of the Na'vi and died during the conflict. Her Na'vi avatar is revealed to have birthed Kiri despite her death. Like most of the cast, she learned free-diving for the film and filmed scenes underwater.[14]\n\t+ Weaver also reprises her role as Dr. Grace Augustine, despite Weaver's saying in 2014 that she would not do so, though she and Cameron confirmed prior to then that she would return in the sequels:[6][15][16] she appears in this film in a video recording and in a spiritual vision in which she meets with Kiri.\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, a human military officer who led the paramilitary security division of the RDA in their conflict with the Na'vi.[17] After being killed by Neytiri in 2154, he is revived as a Recombinant[17] and seeks revenge against Jake and his family. Cameron said in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating, \"I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga.\"[18][19] He later said Quaritch would act as the main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.[20][21]\n\t+ Lang also reprises his role as the original human Quaritch of the first movie in a video recording made for his Recombinant self.\n* Kate Winslet as Ronal, a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife who is pregnant.[22][23] Winslet called Ronal \"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\" but also \"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\" since shooting all her scenes only took a month.[24] It marks her first time working with performance capture, and motion capture altogether. She, like most of the cast, also had to learn free diving for the film; while filming an underwater scene, she held her breath for over seven minutes, a new record for any film scene shot underwater.[14][24][25][26]\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari, the chief of the Metkayina clan and Ronal's husband[27][28][29]\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a former member of the Avatar Program who chose to side with the Na'vi in the first film.[30]\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omatikaya's Tsah\u00eck, and Neytiri's mother.[31][32]\n* Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore, the commander in charge of the RDA's interests.[33]\n* Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby, the head of an RDA private sector marine hunting vessel on the moon of Pandora.[34]\n* Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin, a marine biologist working for the RDA.[35]\n* Jamie Flatters as Neteyam te Suli Tsyeyk'itan (Neteyam Sully), Jake and Neytiri's 16-year-old son and oldest child.[36][37]\n\t+ Jeremy Irwin as young Neteyam.[38]\n\t+ Joel David Moore's son Oliver cameos as the infant Neteyam.[39]\n* Britain Dalton as Lo'ak te Suli Tsyeyk'itan (Lo'ak Sully), Jake and Neytiri's 14-year-old son.[36][37]\n\t+ Chloe Coleman as young Lo'ak.\n* Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuktirey \"Tuk\" te Suli Neytiri'ite (Tuktirey \"Tuk\" Sully), Jake and Neytiri's 8-year-old daughter and their youngest child.[36][37][40]\n* Jack Champion as Miles \"Spider\" Socorro, the 16-year-old son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) who was raised by scientists who stayed back on Pandora and wears Na'vi attire and an oxygen mask when outside a building. He is inseparable from Jake and Neytiri's children.[36][37][41]\n* Bailey Bass as Tsireya (\"Reya\"), a graceful and strong free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari and Ronal's daughter[36][37]\n* Filip Geljo as Aonung, a young male hunter, a free diver of the Metkayina, and Tonowari and Ronal's son[36][37]\n* Duane Evans Jr. as Rotxo, a young male hunter and free diver of the Metkayina[36][37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the former corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation, who appears in a recording made for Quaritch's Recombinant.[42][43][44]\n* Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who worked in the Avatar Program and came to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA in the first film.[45]\n* Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who fought and died in the RDA's battle against the Na'vi in 2154 where he was trampled by a Hammerhead titanothere. Following the RDA's return to Pandora, he is revived as a Recombinant and placed under Quaritch's command. Gerald was announced to reprise his role in August 2017.[29]\n\t+ Gerald also reprises his role as the original human Wainfleet from the first film shown in Quaritch's video recording.\n\n\nAdditionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears uncredited as Zdinarsk, a Recombinant and member of the 1st Recom Squadron. Vela-Bailey previously portrayed Ikeyni, Saeyla, and a blonde woman in a bar in the original *Avatar*. She is also featured as a stunt performer in both films.[46][47] CJ Jones appears, also uncredited, as a Metkayina interpreter of the Na'vi sign language he created.[48] Keston John plays Tarsem, a member of the Omatikaya clan who succeeds Jake when he and his family flee to the Metkayina territories.\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\nFamily is the central concept featured in *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[49][50][51] *RogerEbert.com* critic Brian Tallerico notes that some of the themes in the film echo themes from earlier films directed by Cameron, including *Titanic*, *Aliens* (1986), *The Abyss* (1989), *The Terminator* (1984) and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991). For example, the film asks whether you should run and hide from a powerful enemy or fight their evil, similar to the *Terminator* films. The film also invokes themes of environmentalism and settler colonialism.[52] Comparing the themes of the sequels to the original, Cameron said \"It will be a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you're gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you're probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and you said later you hated it, you're probably gonna love these\".[53]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron speaking in 2010](image)Director James Cameron in 2010\nIn 2006, Cameron said if *Avatar* (2009) were successful, he would consider making two sequels.[7] In 2010, he said the sequels would proceed as planned as a result of the film's widespread success.[8] The sequels were originally scheduled for release in December 2014 and 2015.[9] He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups.[7][11] Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work \"once the novel is nailed down\".[54] He said the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus.[55] The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest.[56] He intended to capture footage for the sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible.[57] In 2011, Cameron said he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, would not be \"strident\" since the film will concentrate on entertainment.[58] The sequels were confirmed as continuing to follow the characters of Jake and Neytiri in December 2009.[12] Cameron implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the story.[59] In 2011, Cameron said he would film the sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry standard 24 frames per second, to add a heightened sense of reality.[60]\n\n\nIn 2013, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in Wellington and at least NZ$500\u00a0million (approximately US$410\u00a0million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).[61][62]\n\n\nCameron mentioned a possible third sequel for the first time in 2012; and was officially confirmed the following year.[63][64] Cameron was then looking to release *Avatar 2* in 2015, but later that year, production was rescheduled for 2014, with the film to be released in December 2016, and to be followed by the two other sequels in 2017 and 2018.[65] By 2015, the scheduled release dates for the sequels were each delayed by another year, with the first sequel expected to be released in December 2017; this was due to the writing process, which Cameron called \"a complex job\".[66][67] The following month, Fox announced a further release delay.[68] In February 2016, production of the sequels was scheduled to begin in April 2016 in New Zealand.[69] In April 2016, Cameron announced at CinemaCon that there will be four *Avatar* sequels, all of which will be filmed simultaneously.[70]\n\n\nNew crew members include cinematographer Russell Carpenter, who worked with Cameron on *True Lies* (1994) and *Titanic* (1997), and Aashrita Kamath, who will act as art director on all four sequels.[71][72][73] Kirk Krack, founder of Performance Freediving International, worked as a free-diving trainer for the cast and crew for the underwater scenes.[74] Several creatures that were first introduced in the Walt Disney World theme park attraction *Avatar Flight of Passage* were featured in the film.[75]\n\n\nIn 2019, after several media outlets shared rumors of potential titles for the *Avatar* sequels, including the name *Avatar: The Way of Water*, Cameron confirmed that the titles mentioned were \"among titles that are in consideration\" but had not been finalized at the time.[76]\n\n\nIn 2022, Cameron said that about ten minutes of \"gunplay action\" were cut from the film as he was no longer inclined to \"fetishize the gun\", although he is known as an \"action filmmaker\".[77]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron said the sequels were being written as \"separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film\", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next film. Screenwriters were also announced: Josh Friedman for the first, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver for the second, and Shane Salerno for the third.[65] However, Friedman later clarified and said Jaffa and Silver were writing the first of the four sequels and he was writing the second.[78] In April 2014, Cameron expected to finish the (then) three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases.[79][80] He said although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first worked together on all three scripts: \"I didn't assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other movie.\"[65][81][82][18][78][83] Cameron added that they had \"worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga\", a creative process that was inspired by his experiences in the writing room of his television series *Dark Angel*.[84] The writing took longer than expected, forcing Cameron to delay the release of the films further in 2015.[66]\n\n\nHe spent a year writing the script for the first sequel titled *Avatar: The High Ground*, a 130-page treatment and then threw it out and started over because \"it didn't go enough into the unexpected,\" which is one of the critical elements about sequels, according to Cameron. At one point, he threatened to fire his writers because they would only focus on the new stories, rather than first figuring out what made the original movie a success.[85][86] In December 2015, in an interview with *Entertainment Weekly* Cameron said: \"I'm in the process of doing another pass through all three scripts [...] Just refining. That's in parallel with the design process. The design process is very mature at this point. We've been designing for about a year and a half. All the characters, settings and creatures are all pretty much [set].\"[87] On February 11, 2017, Cameron announced that the writing of all four sequels was complete.[88] In a November 26 interview the same year, he estimated that the scripts had taken four years to write overall.[53] One element in *The High Ground*, showing an outer space battle between Na'vi, humans and spaceships was cut; this was later used in the prequel novel of the same name. Cameron cited the omission of the sequel's core aspects, which were insufficient, as reasons for the removal.[89][90]\n\n\n\nDiscussing the character of Tuk in a February 2019 interview, Cameron mentioned that she was eight years old, and that the film would feature a scene between Jake and Neytiri taking place from Tuk's perspective: \"There's a three-page argument scene between Jake and Neytiri, a marital dispute, very, very critical to the storyline. I wound up shooting it all from the point of view of the 8-year-old hiding under the structure and peeking in. Having gone through the experience with [Sam Worthington] on *Avatar*, I now knew how to write the Jake character going forward across the emotional rollercoaster of the next four movies.\"[40][91] Cameron said the film addresses the implications of Jake and Neytiri becoming parents in the time that elapsed since the first film.[92] He said:\n\n\n> Becoming a parent changes so much of your behavior and your value system...What we saw in the first film were people who were fearless. Jake would throw himself off his ikran onto a leonopteryx (creatures featured in *Avatar*) but is a father of four going do that?...He's trying to keep his kids alive and trying to adjust his own life. Is he still a warrior? Are these young boys who are 14, 15, 16, coming up, getting all excited about wanting to go to war and fight for their people and for their land? How's [Jake] going to be a hypocrite and hold them back when he has to go do it?[92]\n> \n> \n\n In a December 2019 interview, Lang said his character was always meant to return in the sequels, as Cameron had shared with him \"that Quaritch had a future\" while shooting the original film.[93]\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Producer Landau, Worthington, Salda\u00f1a, Cameron, Weaver and Lang promoting the film in Tokyo\nSam Worthington and Zoe Salda\u00f1a were confirmed in January 2010 to have signed on to reprise their roles in the sequels.[11] Later that year, Cameron confirmed that both Weaver and Stephen Lang would return despite the demise of their characters.[18][15] Cameron also said Weaver would be featured in all three sequels (the fourth one was not planned at the time), and that her character, Grace Augustine, would be alive.[16] In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.[6] Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return as Quaritch in the first three sequels, stating, \"I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga.\"[18][19] In September 2015, Michelle Rodriguez said unlike Weaver and Lang, whose characters had also died in the first film, she would not return in *Avatar 2*.[94]\n\n\nSeveral new cast announcements were made in 2017, with Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder and Matt Gerald all confirmed to return from the first film.[31][32][29][30] Additionally, Cliff Curtis joined the cast as Tonowari, the leader of the Na'vi reef people clan of Metkayina.[27][29] On September 23, 2017, child actor Filip Geljo was revealed to have been signed in an undisclosed role.[95] On September 27, seven child actors were confirmed as a part of the main cast including Geljo: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton and Trinity Bliss as Jake and Neytiri's children; Geljo, Bailey Bass and Duane Evans Jr. as members of the Metkayina (together with Curtis); and Jack Champion, the only one to perform in live action, as a human born on Pandora.[36][37] Cameron later said the child cast had been trained for six months to prepare for the underwater scenes filmed in performance capture, and that they now could all hold their breath \"in the two- to four-minute range\", even then-seven-year-old Trinity Bliss, and were now \"all perfectly capable of acting underwater, very calmly while holding their breath\".[96][97]\n\n\nOn October 3, 2017, it was reported that Winslet, who starred in Cameron's *Titanic*, had joined the cast of *Avatar 2*, and possibly its sequels. Cameron commented: \"Kate and I had been looking for something to do together for 20 years, since our collaboration on *Titanic*, which was one of the most rewarding of my career\", and added that her character was named Ronal.[22][98][23] When asked by ComicBook.com on her reasons to return to work with Cameron, Winslet said he just asked her to play Ronal and she accepted out of a combination of her love for the first *Avatar* film, an attraction to the well-written and strong female role she was offered, a love for being on the water and to work with Cameron and the film's cast.[99] Although the nature of her character was originally unknown, the following month Cameron said Ronal was \"part of the Sea People, the reef people\", in reference to the Na'vi clan of Metkayina, making *Avatar 2* Winslet's first role via performance capture, or motion capture altogether, which she was looking forward to; since she insisted on performing all of her character's movements herself, she, like the child cast, had to learn free diving for the film.[53][24] Winslet, who had been notoriously reluctant about working with Cameron again because of the complicated situations he puts his actors in for their scenes, said Cameron proposed the role to her in July 2017 when he came to help her and their fellow *Titanic* collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio at a fundraiser in France, sending her the scripts shortly after.[24] She commented that her role was \"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\", as she would only have one month of shootings, but also \"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\".[24]\n\n\nOn October 13, 2017, it was announced that Giovanni Ribisi would reprise his role of Parker Selfridge from the first film, in all four upcoming *Avatar* films.[43] On January 25, 2018, Dileep Rao was confirmed to return as Dr. Max Patel. A year later, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell and Jemaine Clement joined the cast in live-action roles.[33][34][35] Marc Maron also auditioned for Clement's part.[100] Edward Norton turned down an undisclosed role in *Avatar 2*, due to only being interested in playing a Na'vi, which his proposed character was not.[101] Joel David Moore's then infant son, Oliver, filmed a brief cameo as an infant Neteyam.[39]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n#### Performance capture[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* entered production and started preliminary shooting on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California, as the main shooting location.[102] Principal photography began on September 25, 2017, on a $350\u2013$460\u00a0million budget; the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.[2][3][103] It was simultaneously filmed with *Avatar 3* (2024).[104] As Weaver later revealed in November, filming had to be moved around to allow her to film a cameo appearance in the series eight finale of *Doc Martin* (2004\u2013present).[105]\n\n\nOn November 23, Cameron said the crew had been undergoing tests with the cast for the last month to film underwater scenes in performance capture, and that they succeeded in filming the first of those on November 14, featuring six of their seven main child actors, including Trinity Bliss.[53] He said \"we're getting really good data, beautiful character motion and great facial performance capture. We've basically cracked the code\".[96][97] The cast and crew did not use scuba sets as \"air bubbles might interfere with the accuracy of the sensors\". Another problem with underwater scenes was how the infrared light used in performance capture was not registered by the camera sensors as it was absorbed by the water, and so UV-light had to be used instead. Two separate performance capture systems were made; one used underwater, and another above the water, which had to work in sync with one another.[106] Cameron said that tests would last until January 2018, as \"we're still working in our small test tank. We graduate to our big tank in January\".[96] It was \"a dialogue scene\", as according to Cameron, the characters communicate via \"a kind of a sign language\".[53] The underwater fight scene between Worthington and Lang was difficult, based on their interviews. Worthington considered this a risky option because doing choke-outs can cause drowning. Overseen by a safety team during the shoot, the actors ensured their survival.[49][107]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2018, Winslet had \"just a couple days\" of shooting left to do.[108] While filming an underwater scene, Winslet held her breath for over seven minutes, breaking the record for longest breath held while shooting a film scene underwater, a record previously held by Tom Cruise for *Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation* (2015).[14] In May 2018, Salda\u00f1a said filming was \"kind of only halfway done\" and that the crew is \"about [to finish] motion capture production on the [second and third] movies, and then after that, they go straight into pre-production for the live-action part that would shoot for six months in New Zealand.\"[109] Salda\u00f1a finished shooting her scenes on June 8, for both *Avatar 2* and its sequel, while Cameron said around the same time that 130 days of performance capture had been shot.[25][26] On November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming with the principal performance capture cast had been completed.[21]\n\n\nPart of the movie was shot at 24 frames per second, but many fast scenes were filmed at 48 frames per second. This allows fast objects still to be clearly visible when moving, but it was also said that too detailed a view sometimes causes the viewer to see playing actors rather than story characters. The projector in the movie hall runs at 48 frames per second, for the 24 fps sections frames are duplicated.[110] To avoid the soap opera effect, Lightstorm Entertainment hired Pixelworks in 2020, which used their TrueCut Motion software to create \"motion grading\", a tool that ensure a movie keep its theatrical appearance.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Live-action[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Landau said live-action filming for *Avatar 2* and *3* would commence in New Zealand in the spring of 2019.[112] Cameron confirmed later the same month that they had \"only wrapped for [the motion capture parts]. Now, that is the vast majority of the characters and it is the vast majority of the running time of the film[s]. But that pesky little live action component is going to cost me five months of my life across the two movies.\"[113] Filming for 2019 concluded on November 29, to resume the following year in New Zealand.[114][115][116]\n\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Landau announced that the filming of the *Avatar* sequel films in New Zealand had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also confirmed that production would remain in Los Angeles.[117] However, virtual production continued in Manhattan Beach, California while visual effects continued at Weta Digital in Wellington.[118] In early May, health and safety production protocols had been endorsed by the New Zealand government, allowing filming to resume in the country.[119]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2020, Landau posted a picture of himself and Cameron on Instagram, showing that they had returned to New Zealand to resume filming. After their arrival, Cameron and 55 other crew members who had traveled to New Zealand started a 2-week government-supervised isolation period at a hotel in Wellington before they would resume filming. This would make *Avatar 2* and *3* the first major Hollywood blockbusters to resume production after postponing filming due to the pandemic.[120][121][122][123] On June 16, 2020, Cameron resumed filming and Landau posted a photo of his crew on Instagram filming the production.[124][125] The New Zealand production hired 46 New Zealand cast members including Cliff Curtis (Tonowari) and Duane Evans Jr. (Roxto), 114 local stunt artists, almost 800 extras, and 36 apprentices and interns.[126][127] In September 2020, Cameron confirmed that live action filming in New Zealand had been completed, therefore completing the shooting of the film altogether after over three years; he estimated *Avatar 3* to be \"95%\" completed, due to having live-action parts yet to be filmed outside of New Zealand.[128][129][130]\n\n\nIn July 2022, the New Zealand Film Commission disclosed that the *Avatar* sequels had received over NZ$140\u00a0million worth of public funding through the country's Screen Production Grant. By comparison, *The Hobbit* trilogy (2012\u20132014) had received NZ$161\u00a0million in film subsidies. While ACT party deputy leader Brooke van Velden criticised the Government's film subsidy programme for allegedly taking public funding from other areas, the Economic Development and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash argued that New Zealand's film subsidies for major Hollywood products brought much needed overseas investment and jobs to the New Zealand film industry.[131]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It's never been done before and it's very tricky because our motion capture system, like most motion capture systems, is what they call optical base, meaning that it uses markers that are photographed with hundreds of cameras. The problem with water is not the underwater part, but the interface between the air and the water, which forms a moving mirror. That moving mirror reflects all the dots and markers, and ... it creates thousands of false targets, so we've had to figure out how to get around that problem, which we did. ... It's taken us about a year and a half now to work out how we're going to do it.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Cameron, on blending underwater filming and motion capture system[132][133]\n\nOn July 31, 2017, it was announced that W\u0113t\u0101 FX had commenced work on the *Avatar* sequels.[134] The film heavily features underwater scenes, actually filmed underwater with the cast in performance capture.[96][97] Blending underwater filming and performance capture being a feature never accomplished before, it took the team a year and a half to develop a new motion capture system.[133][132] In December 2022, W\u0113t\u0101 FX's VFX producer David Conley describe *Avatar 2* as the biggest visual effects project that the company had ever undertaken, totalling nearly 3.3\u00a0billion thread powers. To cope with the huge amount of data, W\u0113t\u0101 used the services of cloud storage company Amazon Web Services.[135]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Landau said *Avatar 2* would have a number of major technological improvements since the first movie. A lot more of the lighting work on the virtual production stage could be done during production instead of post-production, and like *Alita: Battle Angel* (2019), which is produced and co-written by Cameron, the crew can use two lightweight HD head cams to record the actors' facial performance. In addition they also used two digital puppets instead of just one; one that is an accurate copy of the real actor, and another that is the actor's character, allowing the team to re-target one onto the other to make it as accurate as possible.[136][137]\n\n\nCameron said there was a possibility that the film could be shown in \"glasses-free 3D\", along with the sequels.[138][139] But he later disagreed with these rumors and did not think the technology would be there yet.[140]\n\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic (ILM) also returned to assist the VFX for the film after doing so with Weta for the final battle of the first film. ILM assisted in delivering 48 one-off VFX shots for the film's opening scenes.[141][142]\n\n\nThe film was completed on November 23, 2022.[143]\n\n\n\n### Runtime[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2022, *Empire* revealed the runtime was \"around three hours\" at that stage in production.[144] In November 2022, the film's runtime was revealed to be 192 minutes (three hours and twelve minutes).[1] In the *Empire* interview, Cameron said: \"I don't want anybody whining about length when they sit and binge-watch [television] for eight hours... I've watched my kids sit and do five one-hour episodes in a row. Here's the big social paradigm shift that has to happen: it's okay to get up and go pee.\"[145][146]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* is the second Disney-distributed film and the second 20th Century Studios film, after *Avengers: Endgame* and *Titanic* respectively, to exceed three hours in length.[147]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: The Way of Water* (soundtrack)\n\n*Avatar* composer James Horner was originally reported to score music for the franchise, before his death in a plane crash in June 2015.[148] In December 2019, Simon Franglen, who had previously worked with both Cameron and Horner as record producer and arranger since 1997's *Titanic*, including on *Avatar* (notably completing Horner's score for 2016's *The Magnificent Seven* after his passing), was reported to write music for the film.[149] Landau confirmed his involvement in the project in August 2021, while also associating with the forthcoming *Avatar* sequels.[150][151] Horner's score will be reused in the film, in addition to the original themes produced by Franglen.[151] The scoring for *Avatar: The Way of Water* officially began on July 29, 2022.[152] The soundtrack album was released on December 16, 2022, by Hollywood Records.[153][154] An expanded score album, featuring ten more tracks from the original score, followed four days later.[155]\n\n\nIn November 2022, it was reported that the film would feature an original song titled \"Song Chord\" which will be performed by Franglen and Zoe Salda\u00f1a.[156] The following month, it was announced that Canadian singer the Weeknd would contribute an original song \"Nothing Is Lost (You Give Me Strength)\" to the film, produced by Franglen and Swedish supergroup Swedish House Mafia.[153][157]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nDisney extensively promoted *Avatar: The Way of Water* across multiple media platforms, including merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising.[158]\nAt the 2022 CinemaCon,[159] the new title for the sequel was officially announced and the first teaser trailer was debuted at the event,[160] along with four new first look images, showing off the adventures of the Na'vi on and off the coasts of Pandora.[6] It was theatrically showcased at the premiere of *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*,[161][162] and was later released online on May 9.[163] The teaser finished its first 24-hour online window with 148.6\u00a0million views,[164] including 23 million from China alone, according to Disney and 20th Century.[165][166] Grant Ridner of *GQ* commented: \"The trailer features minimal dialogue and primarily focuses on shots of the cerulean Pandora and its residents, as well as indigenous flora and fauna.\"[167] However, Stuart Heritage of *The Guardian* criticized the teaser, saying: \"There isn't a trace of premise here, or character, or any real action to speak of. Instead, we're given a minute and a half of nice-looking scenery. It's like being held hostage to look at someone's holiday photos.\"[168] Louis Chilton of *The Independent* also felt that the trailer \"feels rather too much like a tech demo, or the trailer for a long-gestating video-game sequel\".[169]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the teaser was edited by Disney ahead of the theatrical screenings of Pixar's *Lightyear*, where sequences featuring Sully holding a rifle and few guns were edited. According to Russ Burlingame of *Comic Book Resources*, the trailer was edited due to \"public sentiments to avoid glorifying gun violence\" as *Lightyear* released after the Robb Elementary School shooting incident,[170] while *TheWrap*'s Drew Taylor opined that the change was made on the request of Motion Picture Association for attaching the trailer with PG-rated films.[171] New set photos were released by *Empire* on June 30, showing Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis in their Na'vi forms,[172] and subsequent photos were released on the following day, showing Sigourney Weaver as Jake and Neytiri's adopted teenage Na'vi daughter, Kiri.[13] Though the film was not promoted at the San Diego Comic-Con event, Lego released four new sets from the franchise as a part of the promotions.[173]\n\n\nEight minutes of the film's footage were showcased in 3D at the D23 Expo on September 10, 2022.[174][175] McFarlane Toys had launched several action figures based on the characters and creatures, which were unveiled at the event.[176] The collections were officially released on October 1.[177] A second excerpt from the film was shown during the credits of the *Avatar* re-release on September 23, which evidently varies in different versions and screenings.[178][179] The official trailer was released on November 2 at *Good Morning America*.[180][181] New poster characters were released on November 21, and the second and final trailer was also released then.[182][183] An 18-minute clip of \"never-seen-before\" footage from the film was exclusively released at the CCXP convention on December 2.[184] The footage features independent storylines surrounding Jake's character and events occurring several years since the first film.[185]\n\n\nDisney initiated the environmental global campaign, \"Keep Our Oceans Amazing\", to support the Nature Conservancy in the conservation of marine habitats and animal species.[158][186] A concept art book titled *The Art of Avatar: The Way of Water*, written by Tara Bennett with a foreword by Robert Rodriguez, was made available for pre-order in October 2022, and was set to be released simultaneously with the film.[187] Another book titled *Avatar The Way of Water: The Visual Dictionary* by Joshua Izzo is also set to be released with the film.[187]\n\n\n*Deadline Hollywood* estimated that advertisers paid more than $170\u00a0million for promos. Lightstorm Entertainment and Mercedes-Benz revealed the Vision AVTR concept car inspired by the film at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020. Amazon Echo enabled interactions for its Alexa virtual assistant based on the film, the first time it did so for any film. In China, Disney partnered with JD.com and Alipay for advertising, while Razer Inc. launched the Yaqi Orochi V2 Avatar computer mouse in the country themed after the film. NYX Professional Makeup owned by L'Or\u00e9al promoted a lineup of makeup products inspired by the film. Kellogg's launched an estimated 53 million *Avatar*-themed packages across its three labels. Motorola Mobility and Deutsche Telekom partnered with Disney to promote the film in Latin America and EMEA respectively.[188]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water's* world premiere was held on December 6, 2022, at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London.[189] The film began rolling out in theaters in some countries on December 14, 2022,[190] and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16, with distribution by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through the 20th Century Studios label.[191][192][193] The film is the first in the series to be released under Disney, since its acquisition of both 20th Century Studios and the rights to *Avatar* in 2019.[194][195] The film was released in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX and IMAX 3D formats. Select showings also had support for a dynamic high frame rate of up to 48 frames per second.[196] *The Way of Water,* alongside the forthcoming sequels, was released in Dolby Vision.[53] *The Way of Water* is one of the widest releases ever given for a Disney film, debuting on over 12,000 screens in the United States and Canada and 40,000 internationally.[197]\n\n\nThe 2023 Hollywood Professional Association Tech Retreat revealed that 1,065 individual Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs) were created for the film's theatrical release. This includes specific variations of the film presented in formats such as 2D, 3D, HDR, 4K, varying light levels, aspect ratios and various audio formats, as well as 51 subtitled languages and 28 dubbed language variations. According to Disney's Motion Pictures Operations VP Kim Beresford, the film was divided into 15 reels (resulting in 6,338 portions) to be completed in time; allowing the DCP mastering team to begin creating delivery elements before the complete film was locked. Roughly 800 DCPs were reviewed for quality control five days prior to the film's release date. Walt Disney Studios' VP of Distribution Technology Mark Arana said: \"We had to turn our operation into a 24/7 support model.\" Additionally, Disney's distribution team invented a new system to create and keep track of the numerous versions as well as a cloud-based DCP mastering tool.[198][*excessive detail?*]\n\n\nThe film was subjected to eight delays, as the crew took more time on the writing, pre-production and visual effects process. Initially in late-2010, the film was scheduled for release in December 2014.[9] By mid-2013, Cameron originally intended *Avatar 2* to be released in December 2015,[65] which was subsequently delayed to 2016 and then to 2017.[67][66] In April 2016, Cameron announced four *Avatar* sequels which would be released in December 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023;[70] but, in March 2017, he said this film would not be released in 2018, due to extensive production and the visual effects process.[199]\n\n\nIn April 2017, a new release date of December 18, 2020, was announced, with all the other sequels: *Avatar* *3*, *4* and *5* releasing on December 17, 2021, December 20, 2024, and December 19, 2025, respectively.[200] However, following the announcement of the three upcoming *Star Wars* films,[201] in May 2019, the sequels were delayed another two years, with this film being scheduled to be released on December 17, 2021.[202] The release date was again deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in August 2020, a new release date of December 16, 2022, was announced.[196][203][191] Mentioning the delays, Cameron felt optimistic that they would not harm the films' success, likening *Avatar 2* to his films *Aliens* (1986) and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.[53][204] The film was also approved for release in China, making it one of the few Hollywood blockbusters to be greenlit for distribution in the country in 2022.[205]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* was released for digital download on March 28, 2023. It contains behind-the-scenes featurettes.[206] The film was released on June 7, 2023, on Disney+ and Max.[207][208] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (under the 20th Century Home Entertainment label) distributed *Avatar: The Way of Water* on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD on June 20, 2023.[209] Disney will release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[210]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Theater attendees watching the film in 3D in Barcelona\n*Avatar: The Way of Water* grossed $684.1\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.636\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.320\u00a0billion.[4][5] It had a worldwide opening of $441.7 million, the eleventh-biggest of all time, and the third largest in the COVID-19 pandemic era, behind *Spider-Man: No Way Home* ($601\u00a0million) and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* ($452.4\u00a0million). IMAX accounted for $48.8\u00a0million, the second-highest global weekend ever for a film released in IMAX cinemas.[211][212] It is the highest-grossing film of 2022, the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[213][214] and the highest-grossing film of the pandemic era.[215]\n\n\nIt is the fourth film to reach the $1\u00a0billion milestone in the pandemic era after *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, *Top Gun: Maverick* and *Jurassic World Dominion*, as well as the sixth-fastest overall to reach the milestone at 14 days.[216][217] It crossed the $2\u00a0billion milestone on January 22, becoming the first film in the pandemic era and the sixth in history to reach the milestone. It is also the second-fastest to gross over $2\u00a0billion, reaching the milestone in 40 days.[218][219] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $531.7\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2022's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[220]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nBy December 14, 2022, prior to the film's release in the United States and Canada, *Boxoffice Pro* projected an opening weekend of $145\u2013179\u00a0million, and a total final gross of $574\u2013803\u00a0million.[221] The film made $53.2\u00a0million on its first day, including $17\u00a0million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to a $134.1\u00a0million weekend, nearly double the original's opening of $77\u00a0million, but coming in below expectations while finishing first at the box office.[222][223] *Deadline Hollywood* and *Variety* wrote that strong audience exit scores, the small day-to-day drop, limited competition from other films and the upcoming Christmas holiday all indicated likely strong legs at the box office.[3][224]\n\n\nThe film made $63.3\u00a0million in its second weekend, a drop of 53%,[225] and $95.6\u00a0million over the four-day Christmas weekend, remaining atop the box office.[226] Box office analysts partially attributed the December 2022 North American winter storm for the drop.[227][228] In the third weekend, it grossed $67.4\u00a0million for an increase of 6%, and also grossed $88.8\u00a0million through the four-day New Year weekend,[229][230] while becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2022 in the region.[231] It remained the highest-grossing film at the box office throughout its first seven weekends of release, the highest number of consecutive weekends for any film since the original *Avatar*.[232][233] It is also the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time in the US and Canada.[234]\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nOn the release day of *Avatar: The Way of Water*, Tianjin Maoyan Weiying Culture Media estimated that the film would make $357\u00a0million (\u00a52.5\u00a0billion) and $100\u00a0million in its opening weekend.[235] It grossed $57\u00a0million in the first week in China, according to Artisan Gateway. This included a gross of $51.3\u00a0million during the weekend. The box-office gross of the film was impacted by the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in the country. IMAX meanwhile reported that the film marked its best weekend ever in China, with a $15.8\u00a0million opening.[236] In the second weekend, the film grossed $25.9\u00a0million, for a drop of 55%,[237] and an increase of 42% during the New Year weekend with $36.9\u00a0million.[238] *Variety* predicted that it would continue to dominate the region due to lack of titles offering it competition.[239][240]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nOutside the US and Canada, the film grossed $307.6\u00a0million in 52 countries in its first week of release. The largest openings for the film by the end of the week were in China ($56.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($24.9\u00a0million), France ($21.7\u00a0million), Germany ($19.4\u00a0million) and India ($19.2\u00a0million).[211][212] In the second weekend, it grossed $168.6\u00a0million for a drop of 42%.[241] In the third weekend, it grossed $186.7\u00a0million, an increase of 6% from the previous weekend.[242] In the fourth weekend, it grossed $132.6\u00a0million for a drop of 30%, while becoming the highest-grossing film of the pandemic era outside the US and Canada.[243] The five largest-running total countries by February 26, 2023, are China ($249.8\u00a0million), France ($148.3\u00a0million), Germany ($138.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million) and the United Kingdom ($91\u00a0million). It became the highest-grossing film of all time in twenty box office territories, including Germany, France, Austria, Turkey and New Zealand.[244][245][246][247]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 436 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Narratively, it might be fairly standard stuff\u2014but visually speaking, *Avatar: The Way of Water* is a stunningly immersive experience.\"[248] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 68 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[249] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the first *Avatar*, while PostTrak reported 91% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 82% saying they would definitely recommend it.[3]\n\n\nPositive reviews focused on the visual spectacle of the film, and advocated seeing it in as large a format as possible.[10][250] *Chicago-Sun Times* critic Richard Roeper gave the film a rating of three and a half out of four stars, highlighting the film's visuals as \"some of the most dazzling, vibrant, and gorgeous images ever seen on screen.\"[251] *Variety* critic Owen Gleiberman praised the film as a \"dizzyingly spectacular sequel\" with \"miraculously sustained\" combat sequences, \"scenes that will make your eyes pop, your head spin and your soul race\" and \"state-of-the-art 3D (never in-your-face, just images that look and feel sculpted) [that] makes the film's every underwater glide feel as experiential as one that you're literally on.\" On the other hand, Gleiberman felt that the story is \"basic\" with a \"string of serviceable clich\u00e9s,\" \"bare-bones dialogue\" and little dimensionality to the characters.[252] *The Atlantic* critic David Sims said that the film will wow audiences and exhibit \"new delights...in the alien world of Pandora\" while noting that the film gets off to a slow start that is \"busy with plot details as the film updates the audience on the past decade-plus of Pandoran life.\"[253] Science writer Darren Naish praised the creature design and detailed alien world, saying the series would remain a \"mainstay of discussions in creature design and speculative biology for some time yet\".[254]\n\n\n*Los Angeles Times* critic Justin Chang hailed Cameron as \"one of the few Hollywood visionaries who actually merits that much-abused term\" and said the film will \"stun most of his naysayers into silence\", while also praising the film's tenderness and sentimentality.[255] *Entertainment Weekly* critic Leah Greenblatt summarized her review of *The Way of Water* saying that it \"created its own whole-cloth reality, a meticulous world-building as astonishing and enveloping as anything we've ever seen on screen \u2014 until that crown is passed, inevitably, in December 2024, the projected release date for *Avatar 3*.\"[256]\n\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the film was excessively long, and that the story was not substantial enough to justify the length.[10] *The New Yorker* critic Anthony Lane opined: \"The film is more than three hours long, some of it dangerously close to dawdling; not until the final third does Cameron apply the whip and remind us that, in the choreographing of action sequences, he remains unsurpassed.\"[257] *The Guardian* critic Peter Bradshaw was critical of the \"scathingly bland plot\" and noted that, despite the shift in setting, \"there isn't a single interesting visual image\".[258]\n\n\n*San Francisco Chronicle* reviewer Mick LaSalle called it \"a one-hour story rattling around in a 192-minute bag,\" while acknowledging that \"it looks pretty good,\" incorporating \"one of the best uses of 3-D to date, with visuals that seem to have been conceived in three dimensions.\"[259] *The Telegraph* critic Robbie Collin said that the film \"has no plot, no stakes and atrocious dialogue\" and that \"for all its world-building sprawl, *The Way of Water* is a horizon-narrowing experience \u2013 the sad sight of a great filmmaker reversing up a creative cul-de-sac.\"[260]\n\n\nThe *Toronto Star* commented that the film was poorly received by some indigenous peoples in Canada, being viewed as trying to portray the colonial struggles of an indigenous population, with reviewer Drew Hayden Taylor noting: \"It's also rather conventional in its own way and somewhat boring. Predictable. I've been involved in crooked card games with a less foreseeable storyline.\"[261]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar: The Way of Water*\n\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, *Avatar: The Way of Water* received nominations for Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Production Design; and won Best Visual Effects.[262] Its other nominations include two Annie Awards (winning both),[263] two British Academy Film Awards (winning one),[264] five Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning one),[265] and two Golden Globe Awards.[266] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *The Way of Water* one of the ten-best films of 2022.[267][268]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar 3* and *Avatar 4*\n\n*The Way of Water* is the first of four planned sequels to *Avatar*. *Avatar 3* started filming simultaneously with this film in New Zealand on September 25, 2017. Cast members from previous films, including Worthington, Salda\u00f1a, Lang, Weaver, Pounder, Winslet, Curtis, Ribisi, Moore, Rao, Gerald, Dalton, Bliss, Champion, Bass, and Geljo, have all been announced to return while Oona Chaplin, Michelle Yeoh, and David Thewlis will be playing new characters.[269][270][271][272]\n\n\nAccording to Kirk Krack, Cameron said that Avatar 3 will be 30% water, half of The Way of Water's 60%, and 4 and 5 15%.[106] The ocean scenes for the sequels were filmed simultaneously during the production of The Way of Water.[273]\n\n\nAlthough the last two sequels have been reportedly greenlit, in a November 2017 interview Cameron said\u00a0: \"Let's face it, if *Avatar 2* and *3* don't make enough money, there's not going to be a *4* and *5*\".[53] Thewlis later confirmed this in February 2018, stating \"they're making *2* and *3*, they're gonna see if people go and see them, and then they'll make *4* and *5*\".[274] Conversely in November 2018, Weaver said, after the first two sequels had completed main photography, that she was currently \"busy doing *Avatar 4* and *5*\", which several media outlets interpreted as confirmation that the last two sequels had started filming.[275][276][277]\n\n\nIn January 2019, in face of the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that both *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5* are being developed but have not been officially greenlit.[278] According to producer Landau in February 2019, Iger may have been misinterpreted. He said that *Avatar 4* and *5* \"are not only [greenlit]\" but also a third of *Avatar 4* has already been filmed.[279]\n\n\nFollowing the box-office success of *The Way of Water*, Cameron confirmed that the sequels are effectively greenlit. \"It looks like with the momentum that the film has now that we'll easily pass our break even in the next few days, so it looks like I can't wiggle out of this and I'm gonna have to do these other sequels,\" Cameron said in January 2023, adding: \"I know what I'm going to be doing the next six or seven years.\"[280] It was also confirmed that Brendan Cowell will reprise his role as Captain Mick Scoresby and will also feature the return of Payakan, the Tulkun who befriends Lo'ak.[281] Giovanni Ribisi will reprise his role as Parker Selfridge, with his character having a bigger role in the film after his brief cameo in *The Way of Water*.[282]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films with longest production time\n* List of most expensive films\n* List of highest-grossing films\n* List of underwater science fiction works\n* Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Avatar* (2009)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McClintock, Pamela; Couch, Aaron (October 29, 2022). \"'Avatar: The Way of Water' Runtime Sails Past Three Hours\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS\u00a0*Titanic* in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, David Warner, Suzy Amis and Bill Paxton.\n\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200\u00a0million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84\u00a0billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257\u00a0billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2\u00a0billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS *Titanic*. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the *Titanic* struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 2] After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard *Keldysh*, where she recounts her experiences as a *Titanic* passenger.\n\n\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fianc\u00e9 Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley and Rose's widowed mother Ruth board the *Titanic*. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class *Titanic* ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. Jack soon admits that he has feelings for Rose. When Cal and Ruth object, Rose rejects Jack's attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\n\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\n\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape. Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He poses as a lost child's father to board a lifeboat.\n\n\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The stern slams back onto the ocean, upends again and sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of cold shock, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat. RMS\u00a0*Carpathia* rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket.\n\n\nIn the present, Rose says she heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of *Keldysh*, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[16] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the *Titanic*'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Fictional characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKate Winslet (pictured in 2007), who portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Leonardo DiCaprio (bottom, pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson.\n\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\".[17] Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards *Titanic* with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.\"[17] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role.[18][19][20][21] When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[18] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[18]\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the *Titanic*, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack,\u00a0... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\".[17] Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the *Titanic* in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fianc\u00e9's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993.[22] Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[18][23] Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high.[23] Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition.[24] Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[25] DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[18] Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, \"Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck.[18] Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[26]\n* Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fianc\u00e9, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, who he had previously collaborated with on *The Terminator, Aliens*, and *The Abyss*, for the role,[27] before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[23] and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.[28]\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.\n* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\"[17] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role.[23] Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\"[29] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this *joie de vivre* in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.\"[29]\n* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the *Titanic* in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about *Titanic* for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert. Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio. Jack's Italian best friend, who boards *Titanic* with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the *Titanic* sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\n* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the *Titanic* splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries *S.O.S. Titanic*.\n* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n\n### Historical characters[edit]\n\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[30] the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n\n\n![](image)The real Margaret Brown (right) providing Captain Arthur Henry Rostron with an award for his service in the rescue of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers.\n* Kathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens.[31] Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[32]\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the *Titanic*, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (*Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder*) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40\u00a0a.m.[33] There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[33] It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[33]\n\n\n![](image)Crew of the *Olympic*, 1911. Left: First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right: Captain Edward J. Smith.\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the *Titanic* his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".[34]\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[35][36] After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film *A Night to Remember*.\n* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n\n\n![](image)Wallace Hartley. *Titanic*'s bandmaster and violinist.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany,[37][38] and dies in the sinking.\n* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the *Titanic* struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[39] A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a \u00a35000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[40] Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy.[41] According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"[42]\n* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the *Titanic* was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[43][44]\n* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[45][46][47]\n* Rochelle Rose as No\u00ebl Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\n* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\n* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\n* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow's nest. He survives the sinking.\n* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\n* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.\n* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[48] In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[49][50]\n* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the *Titanic*.\n\n\n### Cameos[edit]\n\n\nSeveral crew members of the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the *Mir* self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[51] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the *Titanic* Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director, writer and producer James Cameron (*pictured in 2000*)\n> \n> The story could not have been written better had it been fiction\u00a0...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable\u00a0... the unthinkable possible.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014James Cameron[54][55]\n\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him *Titanic* was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[56][57][58] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, *Titanica*, was made from footage shot of the *Titanic* wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[56]\n\n\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a *Titanic* film,[59] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"*Romeo and Juliet* on the *Titanic*\".[57][58] Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[18] They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[18][23][29]\n\n\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the *Titanic* wreck,[59] and organized several dives over a period of two years.[54] He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: \"We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money \u2013 or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[57]\n\n\nThe crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[23] Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[23] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with *Titanic*'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.[60]\n\n\nDescending to the site emphasized to the crew that the *Titanic* disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: \"Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" He felt a \"great mantle of responsibility\" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[29]\n\n\nCameron felt the *Titanic* sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[54] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[51] He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[54] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in *Titanic* I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[29]\n\n\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[59] He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the *Titanic*'s crew and passengers.[54] He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[57] From the beginning of the shoot, the team had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said. \"That set the bar higher in a way \u2013 it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[57] Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about *Titanic*, *A Night to Remember*, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[61] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.[30]\n\n\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[54] While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[62][63] Cameron said \"the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Scale modeling[edit]\n\n\n![A ship resembling the Titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small waves.](image)The reconstruction of *Titanic*. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[64][65]\nHarland and Wolff, *Titanic*'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[64] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the *Titanic*'s sister ship RMS\u00a0*Olympic*.[65] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49\u00a0m) tower crane on 600 feet (180\u00a0m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[51]\n\n\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the *Titanic* were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the *Titanic*'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on *Titanic*'s original designs.[66] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[67] Cameron hired two *Titanic* historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[23]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996[15] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*.[51] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale *Titanic* had been constructed.[51] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[68] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[69] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[68] Cameron built his *Titanic* on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[70] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[23] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.[71][72]\n\n\n\n![A pencil-drawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked, only wearing a diamond necklace. From the breast down the picture is cut off.](image)Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[29]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[73] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[29] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[29]\n\n\nThe shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood\". He became known as an \"uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[74] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[74] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[74] Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.\"[74] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[74] In response to the criticism, Cameron said, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[74] More than 800 crew members worked on the film, a large number for any Hollywood production.[75]\n\n\nOn August 9, 1996, during the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[18][76] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[76] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[18] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[18][74] The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[77] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[62][78]\n\n\n\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[15] Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[78] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[78] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[79] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\n\n\n> I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe costs of filming *Titanic* ballooned and eventually reached $200\u00a0million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1\u00a0million per minute of screen time.[80] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[18] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[18] Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights.[81] Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.[82]\n\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"...\u00a0the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than *T2* and *True Lies.* Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. *Titanic* also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-production[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on *The Abyss* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Many previous films about *Titanic* shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[83] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14\u00a0m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[84] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20\u00a0m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[83] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS *Jeremiah O'Brien*'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[85] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[86] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[87]\n\n\n\n![The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.](image)Unlike previous *Titanic* films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000\u00a0L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000\u00a0L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227\u00a0m) exterior of *Titanic* had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[51] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000\u00a0L) tank,[88] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[64]\n\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous *Titanic* films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[23] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[23]\n\n\nA Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[89]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nCameron said there were aspects of the *Titanic* story that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS *Californian*, the ship that was close to the *Titanic* the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the *Californian* was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world. If *Titanic* is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it, but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the *Titanic*'s sinking.[90] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary: \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better\u00a0... You didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then\u00a0... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.\"[91]\n\n\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[92] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[92]\n\n\n\n### Heart of the Ocean[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2\u00a0g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[93] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[94] for $1.4\u00a0million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture* and *Back to Titanic*\n\nCameron wrote *Titanic* while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya.[95] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[96] Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on *Aliens,*[97] but *Titanic* cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[98] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album *Innerst i sjelen*, and particularly liked how she sang \"*Eg veit i himmerik ei borg*\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[99]\n\n\nHorner wrote the end theme, \"My Heart Will Go On\", in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[100] C\u00e9line Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[100] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release.[81] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[101] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[23] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[23] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film *Air Force One* was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative *Indiana Jones* and *Jack Ryan* franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released *Titanic* so close to his own film.[102] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[75] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[23]\n\n\nCameron refused to hold the film's world premiere in Los Angeles.[82] Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[103][82] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by *The New York Times*.[104] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, *Titanic* earned $674.3\u00a0million in North America and $1.583\u00a0billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257\u00a0billion.[Note 1][14] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating *Jurassic Park* (1993).[105] The film remained so for twelve years, until *Avatar* (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[106] On March 1, 1998,[107] it became the first film to earn more than $1\u00a0billion worldwide[108] and on the weekend April 13\u201315, 2012\u2014a century after the original vessel's foundering, *Titanic* became the second film to cross the $2\u00a0billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[109] Box Office Mojo estimates that *Titanic* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[110] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128\u00a0million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[111]\n\n\n*Titanic* was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[112] A *Hindustan Times* report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[113]\n\n\n\n### Initial theatrical run[edit]\n\n\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of *Mouse Hunt*, *Scream 2* and the eighteenth James Bond film, *Tomorrow Never Dies*. It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2\u00a0million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6\u00a0million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120\u00a0million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300\u00a0million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by *Jurassic Park*, which took 67 days to do so.[115] *Titanic* would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace*.[116]\n\n\nIts highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[117][118] On March 14, it surpassed *Star Wars* as the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[119] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[120] By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken by *Lost in Space*, dropping into second place.[121] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[122] equivalent to $1140.3\u00a0 million in 2023[123]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[124] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[125]\n\n\n\n### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Titanic*'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[74][126][127][128] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs \u2013 because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[127] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on *Titanic* in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100\u00a0million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[74]\n\n\n\n> \n> It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: \"I'm the king of the world!\" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in *Titanic*, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant \"eff off\", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Christopher Goodwin of *The Times* on Cameron's response to *Titanic*'s criticism[74]\n\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[126] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[127] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[129] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[127] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen *Titanic* twice by its fifth week.[130] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[131] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[129][132] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487\u00a0million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4\u00a0billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4\u00a0billion after ancillary sources.[133]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s impact on men has also been especially credited.[134][135][136] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[134][135] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[134] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film *Zombieland*, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since *Titanic*.\"[137]\n\n\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during *Titanic* and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of *Titanic* as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during *Titanic* will readily admit to becoming choked up during *Saving Private Ryan* or *Platoon.*\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[135]\n\n\nScott Meslow of *The Atlantic* stated while *Titanic* initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing *Titanic* as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone\u2014including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like *Iron Man*, it is common for boys and men to deny liking *Titanic*. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) *Titanic* an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"*Titanic* has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[136]\n\n\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. *Titanic*'s catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[138][139] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[139]\n\n\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how *Titanic* worked.\"[140] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for *Titanic* was over 20%.\"[23] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30\u00a0am\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[141] Cameron's follow-up film, *Avatar*, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[142][143] and did so in 2010.[106] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge *Titanic* were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly\u00a0... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. *Titanic* just struck some kind of chord.\"[129] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once *Avatar*'s performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[143]\n\n\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing *Titanic*'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s\u00a0\u2013 awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[145][146][147] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[132] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[148] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[149]\n\n\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding\u00a0... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[150] He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[151] On the television program *Siskel & Ebert*, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[152]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, *Titanic* is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch *Titanic*, you experience it.\"[153] It was named his second best film of 1997.[154] Joseph McBride of *Boxoffice Magazine* concluded: \"To describe *Titanic* as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[155]\n\n\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of *Urban Cinefile* said: \"You will walk out of *Titanic* not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[156] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[155] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* commented that \"Cameron's magnificent *Titanic* is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to *Gone With the Wind*.\"[155] Adrian Turner of *Radio Times* awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. *Titanic* is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[157]\n\n\n*Titanic* suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[147] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[158] Kenneth Turan's review in the *Los Angeles Times* was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\"[159] He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[160] Barbara Shulgasser of *The San Francisco Examiner* gave *Titanic* one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of */Film*, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, *Titanic* is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[162] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[163] Similarly, French New Wave director and former *Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma* editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\"[164] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[165] but it also topped a poll by *Film 2003* as \"the worst movie of all time\".[166]\n\n\nIn his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the *Titanic*, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.\"[167] The British film magazine *Empire* reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[168] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[169] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me\u00a0...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike *Titanic*, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[128]\n\n\nIn 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"*Titanic* is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless \u2013 and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for clich\u00e9,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[170]\n\n\nIn 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's *Titanic* was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[171] *Empire* eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's *Titanic* at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[172]\n\n\nIn 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[173] It was listed among the 100 best films in an *Empire* poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[174][175] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement \u2014 one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, *Titanic* demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Titanic*\n\nAt the Golden Globes, *Titanic* won Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[176] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[177] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's *All About Eve*[178] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the *Titanic* to win that award, after 1933's *Cavalcade*), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[179] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in *As Good as It Gets*, Kim Basinger in *L.A. Confidential* and *Men in Black*.[180][181] *Titanic* was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after *Ben-Hur (1959).*[182] *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* matched the record in 2004.[183]\n\n\n*Titanic* won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[184][185] The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[186] It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US.[187] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\n\n*Titanic* also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[188] It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[*citation needed*] The book about the making of the film was at the top of *The New York Times*' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years\u00a0... series six times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| AFI's 100 Years\u00a0... 100\n | Rank\n | Source\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thrills | 25\n | [189] | A list of the top 100 thrilling films in American cinema, compiled in 2001.\n |\n| Passions | 37\n | [190] | A list of the top 100 love stories in American cinema, compiled in 2002.\n |\n| Songs | 14\n | [191] | A list of the top 100 songs in American cinema, compiled in 2004. *Titanic* ranked 14th for C\u00e9line Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\".\n |\n| Movie quotes | 100\n | [138] | A list of the top 100 film quotations in American cinema, compiled in 2005. *Titanic* ranked 100th for Jack Dawson's yell of \"*I'm the king of the world!*\"\n |\n| Movies | 83\n | [192] | A 2007 (10th anniversary) edition of 1997's list of the 100 best films of the past century. *Titanic* was not eligible when the original list was released.\n |\n| AFI's 10 Top 10 | 6\n | [193] | The 2008 poll consisted of the top ten films in ten different genres. *Titanic* ranked as the sixth-best epic film.\n |\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[194] More than $50\u00a0million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[195] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25\u00a0million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500\u00a0million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating *Independence Day*.[196] In that time, it sold 58\u00a0million copies worldwide, outselling *The Lion King* for a total worldwide revenue of $995\u00a0million.[196] By March 2005, the film has sold 8\u00a0million DVD and 59\u00a0million VHS units.[197] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1\u00a0million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2\u00a0million home video units during its first day.[198] Within the first week of release, *Titanic* quickly beat *The Full Monty*, selling a total of 1.8\u00a0million home video copies.[199]\n\n\nA DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[200] At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original *Titanic* DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[200]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc *Special Collector's Edition* was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the *Special Edition* and *Deluxe Collector's Edition* respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title *Deluxe Limited Edition*, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[128] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a *10th Anniversary Edition* was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[201]\n\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012.[202] The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 *Special Collector's Edition* DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\"[203] The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.[204]\n\n\nA 4K release of the film is scheduled to be released by Paramount in North America and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in international markets on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.[205][206][207] [208]\n\n\n\n## Re-releases[edit]\n\n\n### 3D conversion[edit]\n\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The *Titanic* 3D version took 60 weeks and $18\u00a0million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[209] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[210] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[211] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)An accurate view of the Milky Way was used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo from Paranal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20\u00a0am on April 15, 1912.\nThe 3D version of *Titanic* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[213][214] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of *Titanic* embarking on her maiden voyage.[215][216][217]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1\u20442 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies *Titanic*. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[218] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[219] Richard Corliss of *Time*, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments\u00a0... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[220] Ann Hornaday for *The Washington Post* found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[221]\n\n\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7\u00a0million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3\u00a0million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind *The Hunger Games* and *American Reunion*.[222][223] Outside North America it earned $35.2\u00a0million, finishing second,[224] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9\u00a0million.[225] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6\u00a0million on its opening day,[226] going on to earn a record-breaking $67\u00a0million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[225]\n\n\nThe reissue earned $343.4\u00a0million worldwide, with $145\u00a0million coming from China and $57.8\u00a0million from Canada and the United States.[227] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350\u00a0million, the 3D re-release of *Titanic* remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of *The Lion King*, *Star Wars*, and *Avatar*.[228]\n\n\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### 20th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, *Titanic* was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[232]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century's logo with the studio's current name, as a result of Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.[233]\n\n\n\n## *Titanic Live*[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic Live* was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[234][*non-primary source needed*] In April 2015, *Titanic Live* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[235]\n\n\n\n## Merchandise[edit]\n\n\n* In 1998, an official tie-in CD-ROM game was released, titled *James Cameron's Titanic Explorer*.[236] The educational game covered the history of the vessel's construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film's sets.[237]\n* In 2020, a board game based on the film, titled *Titanic: The Game*, was released by Spin Master Games.[238]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Academy Award records\n* List of films by box office admissions\n* *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The totals given for *Titanic* at Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are both incorrect.

As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that *Titanic* had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.[7] Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.[8] By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.[9] At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.[10] The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).[11] A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.[12] Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure. For clarity, *Titanic* earned $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 2012 reissue, $691,642 from the 2017 reissue, and $71,352 in 2020, for a lifetime total of $2,187,687,082 from the first four releases. Along with the $70.2 million grossed from the 25th anniversary re-release in 2023,[13] the lifetime total for *Titanic* stands at $2,257,844,554 as of May\u00a022, 2023[update].\n2. **^** Although the *Titanic* hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Titanic (1997)\". *Film & TV Database*.

Abrams. The sequel to *Return of the Jedi* (1983), it is the seventh film in the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set thirty years after *Return of the Jedi*, *The Force Awakens* follows Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Han Solo's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight in the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire. The ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow.\n\n\nThe film was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 14, 2015, and was released in the United States on December 18. It was positively received by critics, who found it an action-packed film with the mix of new and familiar actors capturing the nostalgia of the original trilogy and giving the franchise new energy.[4] The film grossed $2.07\u00a0billion worldwide, breaking various box office records and becoming the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film at the time of its release. It was nominated for five awards at the 88th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. The film was followed by *The Last Jedi* (2017) and *The Rise of Skywalker* (2019), rounding out the *Star Wars* sequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThirty years after the Battle of Endor,[a] the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to end the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who is missing.\n\n\nOn the desert planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke's location from an old ally. First Order stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren raid the village, capture Poe, and kill the villagers. Poe's droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters Rey, a lone scavenger. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, disillusioned with the First Order, saves Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name \"Finn\". As they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, a First Order Star Destroyer shoots them, and they crash-land. Finn survives and assumes Poe was killed after finding his jacket in the wreck. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the *Millennium Falcon* and escape Jakku.\n\n\nThe *Falcon* is discovered and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the *Falcon*. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke approves General Hux's request to use the weapon for the first time on the New Republic. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions surrounding his father, Han Solo, whom Kylo states means nothing to him.\n\n\nAboard the *Falcon*, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed Luke's temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travel to the planet Takodana and meet with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers help getting BB-8 to the Resistance. The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds Luke's lightsaber. She experiences disturbing visions, denies the lightsaber at Maz's offering, and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.\n\n\nStarkiller Base destroys the New Republic and its four neighboring planets, leaving the Resistance on their own. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey, having realized that she had seen the map, and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper guard.\n\n\nAt the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been in low-power mode since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator. Using the *Falcon*, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth-name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately kills Han. Chewbacca shoots Kylo, injuring him, and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator.\n\n\nKylo pursues Rey and Finn into the woods. He incapacitates Rey, and Finn uses the lightsaber to duel Kylo, but is quickly defeated. Rey awakens, takes the lightsaber, and defeats Kylo in a duel. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca saves Rey and the injured Finn, and they escape aboard the *Falcon*. As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes and erupts into a star. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which points to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.\n\n\nRey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 travel to Ahch-To on the *Falcon*. Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island and silently presents him with his lightsaber.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Star Wars* characters and List of *Star Wars* cast members\n\n![](image)The cast of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con International\n* Harrison Ford as Han Solo: A smuggler and captain of the *Millennium Falcon*[5][6]\n* Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: The last Jedi, who has gone into hiding[7][8]\n* Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa: A leader of the Resistance[9][10]\n* Adam Driver as Kylo Ren: A leader of the Knights of Ren and a warlord of the First Order, who is the son of Han and Leia[11][12][13]\n* Daisy Ridley as Rey: A Force-sensitive scavenger[14]\n\t+ Cailey Fleming as young Rey[15]\n* John Boyega as Finn: A reformed First Order stormtrooper[14]\n* Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron: A high-ranking X-wing fighter pilot of the Resistance[14][16]\n* Lupita Nyong'o as Maz Kanata: A centuries-old and perceptive alien who owns a castle on the peaceful forest planet Takodana[17][18]\n* Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke: An enigmatic, genetically artificial leader of the First Order[14][19]\n* Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux: The commander of the First Order's Starkiller Base[14]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A humanoid protocol droid[20]\n* Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: Han's loyal Wookiee friend and co-pilot[21][22]\n\t+ Joonas Suotamo and Ian Whyte served as body doubles for Mayhew as he suffered from health problems[23][24]\n* Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka: A galactic explorer searching for Luke Skywalker[25][26]\n\n\nTim Rose and Mike Quinn reprise their respective roles as Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb from *Return of the Jedi*, with Erik Bauersfeld and Kipsang Rotich returning their respective voices.[15] Kenny Baker, originally announced as part of the cast, was credited as \"consultant\" for R2-D2,[27][15] with Jimmy Vee performing some of the work for R2-D2.[28] Ewan McGregor has an uncredited vocal cameo as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Rey's vision sequence, while archival audio of Frank Oz and Alec Guinness as Yoda and Kenobi, respectively, are also used in the same scene; Oz recorded new dialogue for the film, but it was replaced with preexisting audio from *The Empire Strikes Back*.[29] *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* voice actor James Arnold Taylor, who has voiced Obi-Wan Kenobi in different *Star Wars* media, originally recorded Kenobi's dialogue, but his recordings were replaced with McGregor's.[30]\n\n\nGwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma, the commander of the First Order's legions of stormtroopers.[31][32] Dave Chapman and Brian Herring served as puppeteers for BB-8,[33] with Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz credited as \"Vocal Consultants\".[34] Ken Leung appears as Statura, an admiral in the Resistance.[35] Simon Pegg appears as Unkar Plutt, the Junk parts dealer on Jakku.[36][37] Greg Grunberg plays Temmin \"Snap\" Wexley, an X-wing pilot.[38][39] Kiran Shah plays Teedo, a scavenger on Jakku who rides a semi-mechanical Luggabeast.[15][40] Jessica Henwick appears as Jess \"Testor\" Pava or Jess Testor, an X-wing pilot.[41][42][43] Brian Vernel appears as Bala-Tik, the leader of the Guavian Death Gang.[44] Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais appear as Tasu Leech and Razoo Qin-Fee, members of the Kanjiklub Gang, a criminal organization.[15] Warwick Davis appears as Wollivan, a tavern-dweller in Maz Kanata's castle.[45][46] Anna Brewster appears as Bazine Netal, a First Order spy, also at Maz Kanata's castle.[15] Hannah John-Kamen appears as a First Order officer.[15] Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Kate Fleetwood play First Order Petty Officers, Thanisson and Unamo, respectively.[47][48] Billie Lourd, daughter of Carrie Fisher, appears as Connix, a lieutenant in the Resistance.[49][50] Members of the Resistance include Emun Elliott as Brance[51] and Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Korr Sella[52] while Harriet Walter appears as Kalonia, the doctor who tends to Chewbacca.[53][54] Mark Stanley appears as a Knight of Ren.[54] Sebastian Armesto portrays Lieutenant Mitaka and Pip Torrens portrays Colonel Kaplan, both serving the First Order.[15]\n\n\nDaniel Craig, Michael Giacchino, and Nigel Godrich cameo as stormtroopers.[55][56] Abrams' assistant, Morgan Dameron, appears as a Resistance officer,[57] while his father, Gerald W.

Horn, and Kevin A. Mayer.[69] Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film.[71][72][73] Lucas' son Jett told *The Guardian* that his father was \"very torn\" about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was \"there to guide\" but that \"he wants to let it go and become its new generation\".[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: producer Kathleen Kennedy, writer and director J. J. Abrams, and writer Lawrence Kasdan speaking at 2015 San Diego Comic-Con\n*The Force Awakens*' first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt.[75] At the time of his hiring, Arndt was also tapped to pen story treatments for the following installments.[76] Arndt took part in a writers room with Simon Kinberg, Lawrence Kasdan, Pablo Hidalgo, and Kiri Hart to discuss and plan the overall trilogy.[77] Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that \"every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.\"[78] The writers decided to use Luke as the film's MacGuffin and, as something that the protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the final scene.[78] Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader (this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel *Star Wars: Bloodline*).[79]\n\n\nSeveral directors were considered, including David Fincher,[80] Brad Bird,[81] Jon Favreau,[82] and Guillermo del Toro.[83] Bird was reportedly the \"top choice\" to helm the film, but his commitments to *Tomorrowland* forced him to withdraw.[84] Matthew Vaughn was an early candidate for the job, even dropping out of *X-Men: Days of Future Past* in favor for the film.[85] Colin Trevorrow was also under consideration by the studio, while Ben Affleck and Neill Blomkamp passed on the project.[86][87][88][89] After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy,[90] J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013,[91] with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.[92] Kasdan worked to convince Abrams to direct the film after the filmmaker initially rejected the offer.[93][94] Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him.[95] The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013. That same day, Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties,[96] both of whom planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, California, New York City, Paris, and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks.[97] Abrams said the key to the film was that it return to the roots of the first *Star Wars* films and be based more on emotion than explanation.[98] In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.[99] In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that *Episodes VII\u2013IX* would not feature storylines from the *Star Wars* expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series *Star Wars Rebels*.[100]\n\n\nAbrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from *The Force Awakens*, such as Rey and Finn's last names and backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that \"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\", but said that Abrams was collaborating with *The Last Jedi* director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with *The Rise of Skywalker*'s then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that \"everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this\".[101] Daisy Ridley later recounted that J. J. Abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.[102]\n\n\nA fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners\"; Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.[103]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been \"keen\" to involve him and conceded: \"If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.\"[104] He also said, \"They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different\u00a0[...] I made them completely different\u2014different planets, different spaceships to make it new.\"[105][106] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told *The Hollywood Reporter* that Lucas had seen the movie and \"liked it\".[107] In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas stated, \"I think the fans are going to love it, It's very much the kind of movie they've been looking for.\"[108] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film \"needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain\" and use plot elements from previous *Star Wars* films.[109]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2013, it was confirmed that *The Force Awakens* would be filmed in the United Kingdom. Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce *The Force Awakens* in the UK.[110] Osborne committed \u00a325\u00a0million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and its film industry.[111] According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, *The Force Awakens* ultimately received a total of \u00a331.6\u00a0million ($47.4\u00a0million) from the government.[112][113]\n\n\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of *The Force Awakens* for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.[114] The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films *Star Trek* (2009) and *Star Trek Into Darkness* (2013).[115] Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.[116] In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).[117] In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.[118]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nOpen auditions were held in the United Kingdom and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of \"Rachel\" and \"Thomas\".[119] Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams.[120] Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement in April 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier. Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement.[121] Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013,[69] their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.[27]\n\n\nAbrams set out to have a more diverse cast than previous installments.[122] A very early report claimed the studio wanted Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron for roles.[123][124] In September 2013, Michael B. Jordan, Saoirse Ronan, and David Oyelowo were among the first to meet with the director.[125] In January 2014, *The Hollywood Reporter* revealed Benedict Cumberbatch, Jack O'Connell, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alex Pettyfer, Jesse Plemons, Sullivan Stapleton, Tye Sheridan, Hugo Weaving, Michael Fassbender, and Adam Driver all met with Abrams for the film. The role Sheridan met for was ultimately rewritten to be played by a 40 year old actor, while Weaving was in talks for an \"Imperial commander\".[126] Ronan, Jordan, Frida Gustavsson, and later Miles Teller would go on to confirm their auditions for the film.[127][128][129][130] Industry publications speculated that Plemons could possibly be playing Luke Skywalker's son.[131] In February, Driver was in final negotiations for an unnamed villain, while Gary Oldman revealed he was approached for an undisclosed role.[132][133] In March, John Boyega, Plemons, Ray Fisher, Matthew James Thomas and Ed Speleers were Abrams' top choice for the lead role.[122] Boyega began talks after dropping out of the Jesse Owens biopic *Race*.[121] That same month, Lupita Nyong'o was said to have met also met with Abrams for the female lead.[134] In April 2014, Plemons and Thomas were no longer in contention for the film.[135] That same month, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, an \"unknown Oxford actress\", and Dev Patel were up for unknown roles.[136][137] Ronan, Richardson-Sellers, Eiza Gonzalez, Elizabeth Olsen and Jessica Henwick auditioned for Rey.[138][139][140][141] Joseph David-Jones, Tom Holland, and Daryl McCormack were later reported to have auditioned for Finn while McCormack made it to the final round of auditions for the part.[142][143][144] Eddie Redmayne and Joel Kinnaman tested for Kylo Ren.[145][146]\n\n\nDaisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his *Girls* schedule. Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April.[121] Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have \"bored\" him.[147]\n\n\nIn April, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow were announced as part of the cast; while Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Baker reprised their roles from the original trilogy.[27] In June, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.[31] To prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke.[148] Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist.[148] Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO,[149] but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him.[150] A flashback scene was cut from Rey's vision (following her discovery of Luke's lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in *The Empire Strikes Back*.[151]\n\n\nIn May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the *Star Wars* set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film.[152] In October, Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in *Return of the Jedi*, as well as Wald and Weazle in *The Phantom Menace* (1999), announced that he would appear in *The Force Awakens*, but did not reveal his role.[153] In November, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film.[49] Lourd first auditioned for the role of Rey prior to her casting.[154]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rub' Al Khali desert around Liwa Oasis in the United Arab Emirates was used as filming location for planet Jakku.\nIn February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.[98] The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[155] That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film.[156] In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun,[157] filming in secret in the United Arab Emirates around Liwa Oasis, part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, by a second unit.[158] Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35\u00a0mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format.[159] In July, Bad Robot reported via Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.[160]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014.[161] The budget was initially estimated to be between $259\u00a0million and $306\u00a0million,[112][162] but in 2023 the actual cost was revealed to be $447 million.[2] Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early May, where large sets were built on location\u2014including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market\u2014and where explosives were used to create a \"blast crater\". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming.[163] Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.[164]\n\n\n\n![view over Skellig Michael showing stone beehive structures and Small Skellig island in the distance](image)\n![concrete missile silo covered in grass](image)\nSkellig Michael in Ireland (top) and former RAF Greenham Common in England served as filming locations.\n\nThat same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the *Millennium Falcon* set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle \"went to a 90-degree angle\".[95] Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford's injury.[165] Ford's son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered.[166] A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly.[167] Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident,[95] but he kept this to himself for over a month.[168] In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident.[169] Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95\u00a0million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.[170]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley.[171] Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England.[172] Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August.[173][174] In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships.[175][176] Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire England was used for some scenes.[177] Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.[178]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bad Robot Productions headquarters in Santa Monica, where Abrams supervised post-production of the film\nKennedy said *The Force Awakens* would use real locations and models over computer-generated imagery.[179] Johnson reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: \"I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick.\"[180] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original *Star Wars*.[181] To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research,[182] created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.[183][184] The Holochess sequence was created using stop-motion, which was supervised by Tippett Studio and overseen by Phil Tippett, who also worked on the stop-motion sequence in the original *Star Wars* film.[185][186]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's *Star Wars* films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film.[187] Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica.[95] In August 2015, he gave the film's estimated running time of 124 minutes.[188] Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: \"At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value [...] So we ended up leaving those things out.\"[189] The final cut of the film runs for 138 minutes.[190]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the film's title was announced as *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[191] In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the *Star Wars* universe, revealed that the working title for the film was *Shadow of the Empire* \"for the longest time\".[192]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (soundtrack)\n\nIn July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy, beginning with *The Force Awakens*.[193] He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis.[194][195] In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in ways that \"there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way.\" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.[196]\n\n\nRecording sessions for *The Force Awakens* began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music.[197] The first day of recording was June 1, 2015.[198] Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings in Los Angeles.[199]\n\n\nThe score was recorded in 12 sessions within a five-month period between June and mid-November. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music; however, Abrams reedited the film, which discarded, modified, or rerecorded the score's part for nearly an hour. Williams' theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus.[200] Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams' behest.[201] Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.[202] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015.[203] Williams' score is more than two hours long.[195]\n\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical *Hamilton*, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.[204]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nDisney backed *The Force Awakens* with extensive marketing campaigns.[205][206] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the media value was $175\u00a0million;[207] its costs alongside home media revenues had later risen to $423\u00a0million by *The Guardian*.[208] On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store,[209] generating 58.2\u00a0million views on YouTube in its first week.[210] Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. *The Hollywood Reporter* called the trailer \"perfectly potent nostalgia\", praising its mix of old and new.[211] *Empire* was impressed by the continuity with the first films\u2014\"the *feel* of classic *Star Wars*\"\u2014but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters.[212] *The Guardian* wrote that the use of the *Star Wars* fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Large-scale outdoor advertising for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* in the city center of Nuremberg, Germany\nOn December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters.[214] On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the *Star Wars* Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was \"staggering [...] the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can't think of anything I've ever been to\u2014other than a rock concert\u2014that felt quite like that\".[215] The trailer was viewed over 88\u00a0million times within the first 24 hours of release.[216] The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. *The Huffington Post*'s Graham Milne wrote that the trailer \"was an affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.\"[217]\n\n\n*Vanity Fair* was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to *The Force Awakens*. The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz.[218] At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film's use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of *The Guardian* writing: \"The featurette's angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.\" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, *Super 8*, saying \"the promos [...] are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.\"[219]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at *The Force Awakens* at Disney's D23 Expo in August 2015.[220] Drew Struzan\u2014who designed the poster artwork for the previous *Star Wars* films\u2014produced a commemorative poster given to the event's attendees.[221] In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer. The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like \"orb\".[222] The trailer debuted during the halftime break of *Monday Night Football*, before being released online.[223] The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was \"frenzied\", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that \"perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film's release is how little of the story it reveals.\"[224] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* felt the trailer was \"a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned *Star Wars* aesthetic\".[225] The trailer received 128\u00a0million views in 24 hours. 16\u00a0million of the views came from its airing on *Monday Night Football*.[226] At the end of October, Air France announced a \"Flight and Cinema\" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France was one of the first countries to release the film.[227] On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.[228]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2015, select theaters across the United States and Canada aired a *Star Wars* marathon, airing the six previous *Star Wars* episode films in 2D, followed by *The Force Awakens* in 3D. Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.[229]\n\n\n\n### Tie-in literature and merchandise[edit]\n\n\nDisney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, \"Journey to *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\", which were released by multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film's premiere. The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the *Star Wars* universe.[230] Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of *The Force Awakens* which was released in e-book form on December 18.[231] In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016.[231] Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of *The Force Awakens* between June and November 2016.[232]\n\n\nDisney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed \"Force Friday\" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for *The Force Awakens*. Beginning at 12:01\u00a0am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world.[233] Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015.[234][235] Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero.[182] Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling.[236][237] Many retailers, such as Toys \"R\" Us, were unable to meet demand for *Star Wars* products due to the event.[238]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSelect characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other *Star Wars* video games: Characters from the film were added to an update to the mobile game *Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes*, available for iOS and Android and released by Electronic Arts;[239] free downloadable content for Electronic Arts' *Star Wars Battlefront* reboot allowed players to battle on the planet Jakku;[240] an update to the mobile game *Star Wars Commander*, released by Disney Mobile for iOS, Android and the Windows Store, allowed players to battle on the planet Takodana during the Galactic Civil War era;[241] and a condensed version of the film's plot becomes an add-on \"playset\" in the toys-to-life game *Disney Infinity 3.0*, with Finn, Rey, Poe Dameron, and Kylo Ren as playable characters.[242] Eventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled *Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on June 28, 2016.[243]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The premiere tent, with the film's poster above\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* premiered on December 14, 2015, at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[244] A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the \"massive\" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests.[245] The film was originally scheduled for a mid-2015 release, but in November 2013, it was pushed back to December 18, 2015.[246] It was also released in 3D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats.[247]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters,[248] of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations,[249][250] as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (high-dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema.[251] Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record.[250] On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in the United States and Canada for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros.' *The Hobbit* trilogy to receive such a release.[252] The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of *The Revenant* (2015) and *The Finest Hours* (2016) in mid-January 2016.[253]\n\n\nAdvance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015,[254] and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing.[255][256] Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater.[257] In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5\u00a0million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1\u00a0million in pre-sales on a single day.[258] In total, it sold over $50\u00a0million in pre-sales, breaking the record.[259][260] This number was raised to $100\u00a0million including $50\u201360\u00a0million in advance ticket sales by December 14.[260][261] However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying \"people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening [...] We have people buying *Star Wars* [*The Force Awakens*] into 2016. It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon.\"[259] Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK,[262] Canada,[263] and Germany.[264]\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* is the first live-action *Star Wars* film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.[265] Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[3] and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm's production logo shown silently before the main titles.[266] Disney chairman Bob Iger explained that the decision not to place Disney branding on the film was \"for the fans\".[267]\n\n\nA poster from mainland China was criticized for being racist due to shrinking the size of the Black character Finn compared to non-Chinese posters.[268][269][270]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* through digital download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, and on Blu-ray and DVD on April 5. Physical copies include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, interviews,[271] and additional footage with eight bonus features.[272] In its first week, *The Force Awakens* sold 669,318 DVDs and 3.4\u00a0million Blu-rays as the most sold film on both formats in the United States.[273] That same week, *The Force Awakens* topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart with 83% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray.[274] Overall, *The Force Awakens* sold 2.1\u00a0million DVDs and 5.9\u00a0million Blu-rays, adding them up to get a total of 8\u00a0million copies, and made $191\u00a0million through home media releases.[273]\n\n\nA Blu-ray 3D \"collector's edition\" of the film was released on November 15, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by director J. J. Abrams.[275] The package includes a Blu-ray 3D, regular Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy of the film, as well as an additional Blu-ray disc for the bonus features.[275]\n\n\nThe movie was rereleased on DVD in 2019 as part of the 9-disc \"Skywalker Saga\" boxed set. It received a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release on March 31, 2020. This 4K release was then included in the 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set on April 20, 2020.[276]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast syndication[edit]\n\n\nThe premium cable network Starz had U.S. broadcast syndication rights for *The Force Awakens* in January 2016,[277] just before the end of Starz's output deal covering most Disney films through 2015.[278] That September, *The Force Awakens* began broadcasting on all Starz networks.[279]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* grossed $936.7\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $1.132\u00a0billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068\u00a0billion,[3] making it the highest-grossing film of 2015[280] and the third highest-grossing film of all time.[281] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110\u00a0million tickets in the United States and Canada.[282] *The Force Awakens* earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in the United States and Canada, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by *Titanic* in 1997.[283] It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1\u00a0billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days.[284] It was also the third film in history to surpass $2\u00a0billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release.[285] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $780.1\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[162]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first *Star Wars* film made more when this adjustment is made.[286] It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.[286]\n\n\nWhile *The Force Awakens* was very successful in the United States and Canada, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as India, other certain parts of Asia and Latin America. This was attributed to it being \"a retro film\" and how overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in North America.[287][288][289] The *Star Wars* franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for *The Force Awakens* heavily focused on appealing to that market.[288][290]\n\n\nNancy Tartaglione of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, *The Force Awakens* did well overseas.[289] While the film had special effects, analysts felt that it lacked the novelty factor; they also stated that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done.[288] Dergarabedian stated, \"No matter what, [*The Force Awakens*] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones.\"[287] Moreover, Mike Fleming Jr. of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that the movie was the \"most valuable movie\" of the year, with \"the net profit to Disney was an astounding $780.11M, and the Cash on Cash Return was twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.00\".[291]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *The Force Awakens* was released on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57\u00a0million from Thursday night previews,[b] of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7\u00a0million from 391 screens.[295] On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1\u00a0million, marking the biggest single- and opening-day record[296] and the first time a film has earned more than $100\u00a0million in a single day.[297] Without Thursday-night grosses, the film earned the second-largest opening-day gross[298] and a record of $247.9\u00a0million for its opening weekend.[273] The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holders *The Avengers* (2012) ($207\u00a0million) and *Jurassic World* (2015) ($208\u00a0million).[299] The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1\u00a0million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters,[300][301] which nearly amounts to the $252.5\u00a0million total earned by *Return of the Jedi*\u2014the second-lowest-grossing film in the series\u2014in its original run.[302] 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78\u00a0million of the opening gross, setting a new record.[300] At that time, the film had the biggest December opening weekend, breaking the previous record held by *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012).[303] It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021) six years later.[304] Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2\u00a0million, to remain in first place at the box office[305] and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.[306]\n\n\nOn January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following *Avatar*) to gross over $700\u00a0million in the United States and Canada,[307] and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days.[308] On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800\u00a0million domestically unadjusted for inflation.[309] On February 5, *The Force Awakens* became the first film to earn over $900\u00a0million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada.[310][311] The film fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26\u201328, 2016,[312][313] and did not achieve $1\u00a0million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.[314]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens.[315] It opened on December 16, 2015, in 12 international markets and earned $14.1\u00a0million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them.[316] It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6\u00a0million for a two-day international total of $72.7\u00a0million, reaching first place in all 44 markets.[317] It grossed a total of $129.5\u00a0million in three days after adding $56.8\u00a0million on its third day,[317] and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6\u00a0million.[318] It broke opening-day records in the United Kingdom ($14.4\u00a0million), Germany ($7.1\u00a0million), Australia ($6.8\u00a0million),[295] Sweden ($1.7\u00a0million), Norway ($1.1\u00a0million),[316] and in 12 other countries.[318] Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5\u00a0million) and Japan ($3\u00a0million).[317] After the five days, *The Force Awakens* had a total international opening gross of $281\u00a0million from 30,000 screens, a new record for December opening[315][319] and the third-biggest international opening of all time.[320] International markets generating opening-weekend tallies of at least $10\u00a0million were the United Kingdom ($50.6\u00a0million), Germany ($27.5\u00a0million), France ($22.5\u00a0million), Australia ($19.6\u00a0million), Japan ($13.4\u00a0million), and Russia ($12.3\u00a0million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia, and Sweden.[315][321]\n\n\nAfter five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529\u00a0million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening at that time, making it only the second time in cinematic history\u2014after *Jurassic World*\u2014that a film had opened to more than $500\u00a0million globally.[319][322] This included an IMAX opening record of $48\u00a0million.[322] Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19\u00a0million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70\u00a0million in 11 days.[323] IMAX generated $17.9\u00a0million from 276 IMAX theaters.[301] The film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9\u00a0million.[324] The film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51\u00a0million.[325] As of February 2016, the highest-grossing markets outside of the United States and Canada were the United Kingdom ($180.7\u00a0million), China ($124.5\u00a0million), Germany ($109.7\u00a0million), Japan ($92.6\u00a0million), and France ($88.2\u00a0million).[326] On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1\u00a0billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat.[327] It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015) to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by *The Revenant* in its sixth weekend.[328] In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.[328]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.[329] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 453 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, *The Force Awakens* successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy\".[4] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[330] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale; women, and people under the ages of 25 and 18 gave it an \"A+\", while 98% of audiences gave it either an \"A\" or a \"B\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 88% \"definite recommend\" while 96% said it met or exceeded their expectations.[331]\n\n\nRobbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* said the film \"sets out to shake *Star Wars* from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past\", and \"it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year.\"[332] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* said that it was \"both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot\", and it was \"ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.\"[333] *Variety*'s Justin Chang wrote that the film has \"sufficient style, momentum, love, and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans.\"[334] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* described it as \"a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure\".[335] Ann Hornaday, writing for *The Washington Post*, thought the film had \"enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans\", and the film struck \"all the right chords, emotional, and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\"[336] *The Charlotte Observer*'s Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had \"pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past.\"[337] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* gave the film his highest rating and called it \"the best *Star Wars* sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015\".[338] Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Business, found it was the best *Star Wars* film since the original trilogy and that it \"is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike\".[339]\n\n\nTom Long of *The Detroit News* wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original *Star Wars*, it leaves \"the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind\", and \"the energy, humor, and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured\".[340] The Tribune-Star called it \"basically the same\" as the original film but \"isn't that what we all wanted anyway?\"[341] Stephanie Zacharek of *Time* wrote that Abrams had delivered \"everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted\".[342] Reviewing for *Forbes*, Scott Mendelson cited the film's \"top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope\", but felt it was so much \"an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture.\"[343] Brian Merchant of *Motherboard* said that the film \"is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod\", and that \"one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.\"[344] *RogerEbert.com*'s Gerardo Valero said the movie \"plagiarized\" *A New Hope* and resorted to nostalgia. He felt that it \"didn't [justify] a return to the universe\" from not having an original story of its own to tell in the plot, characters, and musical score, negatively comparing it to George Lucas' prequel trilogy, and that some of its climactic moments felt unearned.[345]\n\n\n\n#### From *Star Wars* filmmakers[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a \"divorce\" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of *The Force Awakens*. Lucas described the previous *Star Wars* films as his \"children\" and criticized the \"retro feel\" of *The Force Awakens*, saying: \"I worked very hard to make [my films] completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships\u2014you know, to make it new.\" Lucas also likened Disney to \"white slavers\", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized.[346][347] In a 2019 memoir, Disney chairman Bob Iger said that George Lucas \"couldn't even hide his disappointment\" towards J. J. Abrams' interpretation. According to Iger, Lucas said, \"there's nothing new\" after seeing the film, and that \"there weren't enough visual or technical leaps forward\".[348][349] Lucas preferred Rian Johnson's sequel *The Last Jedi* and the anthology film *Rogue One* (2016).[350][351]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\nSeveral awards held their nominations before the December release of *The Force Awakens*, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies.[352] However, the film was added to the 21st Critics' Choice Awards' slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors,[353] and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of *The Force Awakens*,[352] where it was named one of the top-ten films of 2015.[354]\n\n\nAt the 88th Academy Awards, *The Force Awakens* received nominations for Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects.[355] The film's other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and a Critics' Choice Movie Award.[356][357]\n\n\n\n### Fan backlash[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(June 2023)*\n |\n\n\nThe release of the first film trailer for *The Force Awakens* in 2015 spurred a racial backlash against the casting of Boyega, a Black British actor, in such a prominent role.[358] Some social media users called for a boycott of the film, which they accused of being \"anti-white\"[359] and of promoting \"white genocide\".[360] One such account promoted the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory.[361] The character of Rey was also criticized as a too-perfect \"Mary Sue\" character by a group of fans who became known as the \"Fandom Menace\", who focused their ire at Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, whom they accused of spoiling the film franchise by including \"forced diversity\" and pro-feminist politics.[362]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* and *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*\n\n*The Force Awakens* was followed by *The Last Jedi* in 2017.[363] The film's plot follows the Resistance escaping from the First Order.[364] Like the previous film, *The Last Jedi* was a financial success and fared well with critics.[365]\n\n\nA sequel to *The Last Jedi* was released in 2019, titled *The Rise of Skywalker*.[366] As the conclusion to the Skywalker narrative,[367] it focuses on the Resistance assault on the Final Order, a reorganized First Order.[364] Critics' reactions to *The Rise of Skywalker* were mixed.[368][369]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Return of the Jedi* (1983)\n2. **^** The $57 million figure incorporates revenues generated from the \"*Star Wars* Marathon Event\" from 135 theaters in which all previous six *Star Wars* films were shown along with *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.
