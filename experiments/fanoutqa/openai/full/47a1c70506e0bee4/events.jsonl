There are also corporations having foundation in the United States, such as corporate headquarters, operational headquarters and independent subsidiaries. The list excludes large privately held companies such as Cargill and Koch Industries whose financial data is not necessarily available to the public. However, this list does include several government-sponsored enterprises that were created by acts of Congress and later became publicly traded.\n\n\n\n\n## List of the largest

It also owns and operates Sam's Club retail warehouses.[11][12]\n\n\nAs of October 31, 2022,[update] Walmart has 10,586 stores and clubs in 24 countries, operating under 46 different names.[2][3][4] The company operates under the name Walmart in the United States and Canada, as Walmart de México y Centroamérica in Mexico and Central America, and as Flipkart Wholesale in India. It has wholly owned operations in Chile, Canada, and South Africa. Since August 2018, Walmart held only a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, which was renamed Grupo Big in August 2019, with 20 percent of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80% ownership of the company. They eventually divested their shareholdings in Grupo Big to French retailer Carrefour, in transaction worth R$7 billion and completed on June 7, 2022.[13]\n\n\nWalmart is the world's largest company by revenue, with about US$570 billion in annual revenue, according to the *Fortune* Global 500 list in October 2022.[14] It is also the largest private employer in the world with 2.2 million employees. It is a publicly traded family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family. Sam Walton's heirs own over 50 percent of Walmart through both their holding company Walton Enterprises and their individual holdings.[15] Walmart was the largest United States grocery retailer in 2019, and 65 percent of Walmart's US$510.329 billion sales came from U.S. operations.[16][17]\n\n\nWalmart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. By 1988, it was the most profitable retailer in the U.S.,[18] and it had become the largest in terms of revenue by October 1989.[19] The company was originally geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest, but it had stores from coast to coast by the early 1990s. Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989, and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster, in July 1990. A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania, opened in October 1990, the first main store in the Northeast.[20]\n\n\nWalmart's investments outside the U.S. have seen mixed results. Its operations and subsidiaries in Canada,[21] the United Kingdom (ASDA),[22] Central America, South America, and China are successful, but its ventures failed in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Argentina.[23][24][25][26]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(June 2020)*\n |\n\n\n### 1945–1969: Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founder Sam Walton\n![Picture of Sam Walton's original Five and Dime store in Bentonville, Arkansas, now serving as The Walmart Museum.](image)Sam Walton's original Walton's Five and Dime Store in Bentonville, Arkansas, now serving as The Walmart Museum\nIn 1945, businessman and former J. C. Penney employee Sam Walton bought a branch of the Ben Franklin stores from the Butler Brothers.[27] His primary focus was selling products at low prices to get higher-volume sales at a lower profit margin, portraying it as a crusade for the consumer. He experienced setbacks because the lease price and branch purchase were unusually high, but he was able to find lower-cost suppliers than those used by other stores and was consequently able to undercut his competitors on pricing.[28] Sales increased 45 percent in his first year of ownership to US$105,000 in revenue, which increased to $140,000 the next year and $175,000 the year after that. Within the fifth year, the store was generating $250,000 in revenue. The lease then expired for the location and Walton was unable to reach an agreement for renewal, so he opened up a new store at 105 N. Main Street in Bentonville, naming it \"Walton's Five and Dime\".[28][29] That store is now the Walmart Museum.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1962 to 1964\nOn July 2, 1962, Walton opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City store at 719 W. Walnut Street in Rogers, Arkansas. Its design was inspired by Ann & Hope, which Walton visited in 1961, as did Kmart founder Harry B. Cunningham.[31][32] The name was derived from FedMart, a chain of discount department stores founded by Sol Price in 1954, whom Walton was also inspired by. Walton stated that he liked the idea of calling his discount chain \"Wal-Mart\" because he \"really liked Sol's FedMart name\". The building is now occupied by a hardware store and an antiques mall, while the company's \"Store #1\" has since expanded to a Supercenter several blocks west at 2110 W. Walnut Street. Within its first five years, the company expanded to 18 stores in Arkansas and reached $9 million in sales.[33] In 1968, it opened its first stores outside Arkansas in Sikeston, Missouri and Claremore, Oklahoma.[34]\n\n\n\n### 1969–1990: Incorporation and growth as a regional power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1966 to 1981\nThe company was incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law as Wal-Mart, Inc. on October 31, 1969, and changed its name to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in 1970. The same year, the company opened a home office and first distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. It had 38  stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2  million. It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 for $47 per share. By this time, Wal-Mart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3  million.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1981 to 1992\nIn the 1980s, Wal-Mart briefly experimented with a precursor to the Supercenter, the Hyper-Mart. Four stores combined features of discount stores, supermarkets, pharmacies, video arcades, and other amenities.[35] Wal-Mart continued to grow rapidly, and by the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 Wal-Mart stores with sales of $15.9  billion and 200,000 associates.[34] One reason for Wal-Mart's success between 1980 and 2000 is believed to be its contiguous pattern of expansion over time, building new distribution centers in a hub and spoke framework within driving distance of existing Supercenters.[35]\n\n\nThe company's satellite network was also completed in 1987, a $24 million investment linking all stores with two-way voice and data transmissions and one-way video communications with the Bentonville office. At the time, the company was the largest private satellite network, allowing the corporate office to track inventory and sales and to instantly communicate with stores.[36] By 1984, Sam Walton had begun to source between 6% and 40% of his company's products from China.[37] In 1988, Walton stepped down as CEO and was replaced by David Glass.[38] Walton remained as chairman of the board. During this year, the first Wal-Mart Supercenter opened in Washington, MO.[39]\n\n\nWith the contribution of its superstores, the company surpassed Toys \"R\" Us in toy sales in 1998.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### 1990–2005: Retail rise to multinational status[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1992 to 2008, still used in some locations and on many semi-truck trailers\nWhile it was the third-largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart was more profitable than rivals Kmart and Sears by the late 1980s. By 1990, it became the largest U.S. retailer by revenue.[42][43]\n\n\nPrior to the summer of 1990, Wal-Mart had no presence on the West Coast or in the Northeast (except for a single Sam's Club in New Jersey which opened in November 1989), but in July and October that year, it opened its first stores in California and Pennsylvania, respectively. By the mid-1990s, it was the most powerful retailer in the U.S. and expanded into Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994.[44] Wal-Mart stores opened throughout the rest of the U.S., with Vermont being the last state to get a store in 1995.[45]\n\n\nThe company also opened stores outside North America, entering South America in 1995 with stores in Argentina and Brazil; and Europe in July 1999, buying Asda in the United Kingdom for US$10 billion.[46]\n\n\nIn 1997, Wal-Mart was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[47]\n\n\nIn 1998, Wal-Mart introduced the Neighborhood Market concept with three stores in Arkansas.[48] By 2005, estimates indicate that the company controlled about 20 percent of the retail grocery and consumables business.[49]\n\n\nIn 2000, H. Lee Scott became Wal-Mart's president and CEO as the company's sales increased to $165 billion.[50] In 2002, it was listed for the first time as America's largest corporation on the Fortune 500 list, with revenues of $219.8 billion and profits of $6.7 billion. It has remained there every year except 2006, 2009, and 2012.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][*excessive citations*]\n\n\nIn 2005, Wal-Mart reported US$312.4 billion in sales, more than 6,200 facilities around the world—including 3,800 stores in the United States and 2,800 elsewhere, employing more than 1.6 million associates. Its U.S. presence grew so rapidly that only small pockets of the country remained more than 60 miles (97 kilometers) from the nearest store.[62]\n\n\nAs Wal-Mart expanded rapidly into the world's largest corporation, many critics worried about its effect on local communities, particularly small towns with many \"mom and pop\" stores. There have been several studies on the economic impact of Wal-Mart on small towns and local businesses, jobs, and taxpayers. In one, Kenneth Stone, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Wal-Mart store opening.[63] However, in another study, he compared the changes to what small-town shops had faced in the past—including the development of the railroads, the advent of the Sears Roebuck catalog, and the arrival of shopping malls—and concluded that shop owners who adapt to changes in the retail market can thrive after Wal-Mart arrives.[63] A later study in collaboration with Mississippi State University showed that there are \"both positive and negative impacts on existing stores in the area where the new supercenter locates.\"[64]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, Wal-Mart used its logistics network to organize a rapid response to the disaster, donating $20 million, 1,500 truckloads of merchandise, food for 100,000 meals, and the promise of a job for every one of its displaced workers.[65] An independent study by Steven Horwitz of St. Lawrence University found that Wal-Mart, The Home Depot, and Lowe's made use of their local knowledge about supply chains, infrastructure, decision makers and other resources to provide emergency supplies and reopen stores well before the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) began its response.[66] While the company was overall lauded for its quick response amidst criticism of FEMA, several critics were quick to point out that there still remained issues with the company's labor relations.[67]\n\n\nIn 2006, Charles Fishman published *The Wal-Mart Effect*, examining the operation of Wal-Mart's supply chain. His book caught the attention of the press and the public. Fishman's case studies illustrate Wal-Mart's drive to lower costs and achieve greater efficiency and suggest that it may have significant upstream effects. Since Fishman's book was published, Wal-Mart has more than doubled in size. Further research on Wal-Mart's role in the food supply chain has tended to be limited and anecdotal.[35][68]\n\n\n\n### 2005–2010: Initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![Aerial view of dozens of solar panels distributed around the roof of a Walmart store](image)Solar modules mounted on a Walmart Supercenter in Caguas, Puerto Rico (Store #2449)\n#### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2005, Wal-Mart announced several environmental measures to increase energy efficiency and improve its overall environmental record, which had previously been lacking.[69] The company's primary goals included spending $500 million a year to increase fuel efficiency in Wal-Mart's truck fleet by 25 percent over three years and double it within ten; reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in seven years; reduce energy use at stores by 30 percent; and cut solid waste from U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs by 25 percent in three years. CEO Lee Scott said that Wal-Mart's goal was to be a \"good steward of the environment\" and ultimately use only renewable energy sources and produce zero waste.[70] The company also designed three new experimental stores with wind turbines, photovoltaic solar panels, biofuel-capable boilers, water-cooled refrigerators, and xeriscape gardens.[71] In this time, Wal-Mart also became the biggest seller of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic cotton in the world, while reducing packaging and energy costs.[69] In 2007, the company worked with outside consultants to discover its total environmental impact and find areas for improvement. Wal-Mart created its own electric company in Texas, named Texas Retail Energy, which planned to supply its stores with cheap power purchased at wholesale prices. Through this new venture, the company expected to save $15 million annually and also to lay the groundwork and infrastructure to sell electricity to Texas consumers in the future.[72]\n\n\n\n#### Branding and store design changes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Wal-Mart announced that it would remodel its U.S. stores to help it appeal to a wider variety of demographics, including more affluent shoppers. As part of the initiative, the company launched a new store in Plano, Texas, that included high-end electronics, jewelry, expensive wines and a sushi bar.[73]\n\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Wal-Mart introduced new advertising with the slogan, \"*Save money. Live better.*\", replacing the previous slogan \"*Always Low Prices, Always*\", which it had used since 1988. Global Insight, which conducted the research that supported the ads, found that Wal-Mart's price level reduction resulted in savings for consumers of $287 billion in 2006, which equated to $957 per person or $2,500 per household (up 7.3 percent from the 2004 savings estimate of $2,329).[74]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2008, Wal-Mart removed the hyphen from its logo and replaced the star with a *Spark* symbol that resembles a sunburst, flower, or star. The store branding became \"Walmart\", with the corporate name remaining with the hyphen as \"Wal-Mart\". The new logo received mixed reviews from design critics who questioned whether the new logo was as bold as those of competitors, such as the Target bullseye, or as instantly recognizable as the previous company's logo, which was used for 18 years.[75] The new logo[76] made its debut on the company's website on July 1, 2008, and its U.S. locations updated store logos in the fall of 2008.[77] Walmart Canada started to adopt the logo for its stores in early 2009.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Acquisitions and employee benefits[edit]\n\n\nOn March 20, 2009, Walmart announced that it was paying a combined US$933.6 million in bonuses to every full and part-time hourly worker.[79] This was in addition to $788.8 million in profit sharing, 401(k) pension contributions, hundreds of millions of dollars in merchandise discounts, and contributions to the employees' stock purchase plan.[80] While the economy at large was in an ongoing recession, Walmart reported solid financial figures for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009, with $401.2 billion in net sales, a gain of 7.2 percent from the prior year. Income from continuing operations increased 3 percent to $13.3 billion, and earnings per share rose 6 percent to $3.35.[81]\n\n\nOn February 22, 2010, the company confirmed it was acquiring video streaming company Vudu, Inc. for an estimated $100 million.[82]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Walmart acquired the Israeli startup Zeekit startup for $200 million. Zeekit uses artificial intelligence to allow customers to try on clothing via a dynamic virtual platform.[83]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2019[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A truck converted to run on biofuelWalmart's truck fleet logs millions of miles each year, and the company planned to double the fleet's efficiency between 2005 and 2015.[84] The truck pictured is one of 15 based at Walmart's Buckeye, Arizona, distribution center that was converted to run on biofuel from reclaimed cooking grease made during food preparation at Walmart stores.[85]\n\n\nStudies of food choice, dietary quality, and health have found that Supercenters in the United States are associated with increases in obesity rates and average body mass, and that shoppers at Walmart do not follow Dietary Guidelines for Americans as well as shoppers at traditional supermarkets.[35]\nIn January 2011, Walmart announced a program to improve the nutritional value of its store brands over five years, reduce prices for whole foods and vegetables, and open stores in low-income areas, so-called \"food deserts\", where there are no supermarkets.[86] Subsequent research is limited. Walmart may increase food access and decrease food instability, but it does not appear to increase dietary quality.[35]\n\n\nOn April 23, 2011, the company announced that it was testing its new \"Walmart To Go\" home delivery system where customers will be able to order specific items offered on their website. The initial test was in San Jose, California, and the company has not yet said whether the delivery system will be rolled out nationwide.[87]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2012, Walmart launched its first mail subscription service called Goodies. Customers pay a $7 monthly subscription for five to eight delivered food samples each month, so they can try new foods.[88] The service shut down in late 2013.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2013, the firm announced it was in talks to acquire a majority stake in the Kenya-based supermarket chain, Naivas.[90]\n\n\nIn June 2014, some Walmart employees went on strike in major U.S. cities demanding higher wages.[91] In July 2014, American actor and comedian Tracy Morgan launched a lawsuit against Walmart seeking punitive damages over a multi-car pile-up which the suit alleges was caused by the driver of one of the firm's tractor-trailers who had not slept for 24 hours. Morgan's limousine was apparently hit by the trailer, injuring him and two fellow passengers and killing a fourth, fellow comedian James McNair.[92] Walmart settled with the McNair family for $10 million, while admitting no liability.[93] Morgan and Walmart reached a settlement in 2015 for an undisclosed amount,[94] though Walmart later accused its insurers of \"bad faith\" in refusing to pay the settlement.[95]\n\n\nIn 2015, the company closed five stores on short notice for plumbing repairs.[96] However, employees and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) alleged some stores were closed in retaliation for strikes aimed at increasing wages and improving working conditions.[97] The UFCW filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. All five stores have since reopened.[98]\n\n\nIn 2015, Walmart was the biggest US commercial producer of solar power with 142 MW capacity, and had 17 energy storage projects.[99][100] This solar was primarily on rooftops, whereas there is an additional 20,000 m2 for solar canopies over parking lots.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)Walmart Supercenter in Grundy, Virginia (Store #3303). This store was built as part of a $200 million revitalization project.[102][103] The store was built on top of a two-story parking garage, the only one of its kind in the United States.[104]\nOn January 15, 2016, Walmart announced it would close 269 stores in 2016, affecting 16,000 workers.[105] One hundred and fifty-four of these stores earmarked for closure were in the U.S. (150 Walmart U.S. stores, 115 Walmart International stores, and 4 Sam's Clubs). Ninety-five percent of these U.S. stores were located, on average, 10 miles from another Walmart store. The 269 stores represented less than 1 percent of global square footage and revenue for the company. The 102 locations of Neighborhood Markets that were formerly or originally planned to be Walmart Express, which had been in a pilot program since 2011 and converted in to Neighborhood Markets in 2014, were included in the closures. Walmart planned to focus on \"strengthening Supercenters, optimizing Neighborhood Markets, growing the e-commerce business and expanding pickup services for customers\". In fiscal 2017, the company plans to open between 50 and 60 Supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets, 7 to 10 Sam's Clubs, and 200 to 240 international locations.[106] At the end of fiscal 2017, Walmart opened 38 Supercenters and relocated, expanded or converted 21 discount stores into Supercenters, for a total of 59 Supercenters, and opened 69 Neighborhood Markets, 8 Sam's Clubs, and 173 international locations, and relocated, expanded or converted 4 locations for a total of 177 international locations. On August 8, 2016, Walmart announced a deal to acquire e-commerce website Jet.com for US$3.3 billion.[107][108] Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore stayed on to run Jet.com in addition to Walmart's existing U.S. e-commerce operation. The acquisition was structured as a payout of $3 billion in cash, and an additional $300 million in Walmart stock vested over time as part of an incentive bonus plan for Jet.com executives.[109] On October 19, 2016, Walmart announced it would partner with IBM and Tsinghua University to track the pork supply chain in China using blockchain.[110] The use of blockchain to automate the tracking of the supply chain promises the potential for Walmart to save money and thus increase profits.[111]\n\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Walmart announced the acquisition of Moosejaw, a leading online active outdoor retailer, for approximately $51 million. The acquisition closed on February 13, 2017.[112] On June 16, 2017, Walmart agreed to acquire the men's apparel company Bonobos for $310 million in an effort to expand its fashion holdings.[113] On September 29, 2017, Walmart acquired Parcel, a technology-based, same-day and last-mile delivery company in Brooklyn.[114] In 2018, Walmart started crowdsourcing delivery services to customers using drivers' private vehicles, under the brand \"Spark\".[115]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2017, Walmart announced that it would change its corporate name to Walmart Inc. from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. effective February 1, 2018.[116][117]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2018, Walmart announced that 63 Sam's Club locations in cities including Memphis, Houston, Seattle, and others would be closing. Some of the stores had already liquidated, without notifying employees; some employees learned by a company-wide email delivered January 11. All of the 63 stores were gone from the Sam's Club website as of the morning of January 11. Walmart said that ten of the stores will become e-commerce distribution centers and employees can reapply to work at those locations. *Business Insider* magazine calculated that over 11,000 workers will be affected.[118][119] On the same day, Walmart announced that as a result of the new tax law, it would be raising Walmart starting wages, distributing bonuses, expanding its leave policies and contributing toward the cost of employees' adoptions. Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, said, \"We are early in the stages of assessing the opportunities tax reform creates for us to invest in our customers and associates and to further strengthen our business, all of which should benefit our shareholders.\"[120]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Walmart announced that it is producing its own brand of meal kits in all of its stores that is priced under Blue Apron designed to serve two people.[121]\n\n\nIt was reported that Walmart is now looking at entering the subscription-video space, hoping to compete with Netflix and Amazon. They have enlisted the help of former Epix CEO, Mark Greenberg, to help develop a low-cost subscription video-streaming service.[122]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Walmart partnered with comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres to launch a new brand of women's apparel and accessories called EV1.[123]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2019, Walmart announced that it had acquired Tel Aviv-based product review start-up Aspectiva for an undisclosed sum.[124]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Walmart announced the launch of free one-day shipping on more than 220,000 items with minimum purchase amount of $35.[125] The initiative first launched in Las Vegas and the Phoenix area.[126]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Walmart made the announcement that it would cease the sale of all e-cigarettes due to \"regulatory complexity and uncertainty\" over the products. Earlier in 2019, Walmart stopped selling fruit-flavored e-cigarette and had raised the minimum age to 21 for the purchase of products containing tobacco.[127] That same month, Walmart opened its first Health Center, a \"medical mall\" where customers can purchase primary care services, such as vision tests, dental exams and root canals, lab work, X-rays and EKGs, counseling, and fitness and diet classes. Prices without insurance were listed, for instance, at $30 for an annual physical and $45 for a counseling session.[128] Continuing with its health care initiative, they opened a 2,600 square feet (240 m2) health and wellness clinic prototype in Springdale, Arkansas just to expand services.[129]\n\n\nAs of October 2019, Walmart stopped selling all live fish and aquatic plants.[130]\n\n\n\n### 2020s: Continuing growth and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Signs on a Walmart indicated changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced store closures, limited store occupancy, large-scale employee dismissal, and the enforcement of social distancing protocols for Walmart and many other companies. Store hours were adjusted to allow cleaning and stocking.\n\n\nIn March 2020, due to the pandemic, Walmart changed some of its employee benefits. Employees can now decide to stay home and take unpaid leave if they feel unable to work or uncomfortable coming to work. Additionally, Walmart employees who contract the virus will receive \"up to two weeks of pay\". After two weeks, hourly associates who are unable to return to work are eligible for up to 26 weeks in pay.[131] As of July 21, 2020, Walmart paid pandemic bonuses of $428 million to staff. People who did part-time or temporary work received a bonus of $150 while those who worked full-time received a bonus of $300.[132] In July 2020, Walmart announced that all customers would be required to wear masks in all stores nationwide, including Sam's Club.[133]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, consumers responded to COVID by shopping less frequently (5.6% fewer transactions), and buying more when they did shop (16.5%).[134] As people shifted from eating out to eating at home,[35] net sales at Walmart increased by 10.5%, while online sales rose by 74%. Although Walmart experienced a 5.5% increase in operating expenses, its net income increased by 3.9%.[134] In the third quarter of 2020, ending October 31, Walmart reported revenue of $134.7 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 5.2 percent.[135]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Walmart launched a new service, Carrier Pickup, that allows the customers to schedule a return for a product bought online, in-store, or from a third-party vendor. These services can be initiated on the Walmart App or on the website.[136]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Walmart announced that the company is launching a fintech startup, with venture partner Ribbit Capital, to provide financial products for consumers and employees.[137]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Walmart acquired technology from Thunder Industries, which uses automation to create digital ads, to expand its online marketing capabilities.[138]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Walmart announced it would open its Spark crowdsource delivery to other businesses as a white-label service, competing with Postmates and online food ordering delivery companies.[115]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Walmart announced it will participate in the Stephens Investment Conference Wednesday, and the Morgan Stanley Virtual Global Consumer & Retail Conference.[139] In June 2022, Walmart announced it would be acquiring Memomi, an AR optical tech company.[140]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Walmart announced it would be acquiring Volt Systems, a vendor management and product tracking software company.[141] Walmart announced it was partnering with Paramount to offer Paramount+ content\nto its Walmart+ subscribers in a bid to better compete with Amazon.[142]\n\n\nWalmart announced in August 2022 that locations were not going back to 24 hours with most stores now being open between 6am and 11pm.[143]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Walmart announced it would raise its minimum wage for U.S. hourly workers from $12 to $14 an hour. Approximately 340,000 employees are expected to receive a raise, effective in early March 2023, and Walmart's U.S. average wage is expected to be over $17.50. The company also announced it would be adding additional college degrees and certificates to its Live Better U program.[144]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Walmart announced that they had made $611.3 billion in sales in the previous financial year, up 6.7%, which included a bump in the fourth quarter of the year, which saw $164 billion in sales. Profits for the company were also up, almost doubled from the previous year.[145]\n\n\nIn April 2023, the company announced it would add electric vehicle charging stations at thousands of stores by 2030, which would be on top of the almost 1,300 existing stations that were in operation at 280 company locations at the time of the announcement. *CNBC* noted that the company stated it had more than 4,700 stores and 600 Sam Club's stores that were located within 10 miles of roughly 90% of Americans.[146]\n\n\n\n## Operating divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of assets owned by Walmart\n\n![](image)Map of countries with Walmart stores   \nLegend: Current market locations\n Former market locations\n No current market locations\n\nAs of 2016, Walmart's operations are organized into four divisions: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, Sam's Club and Global eCommerce.[147] In the United States, Walmart's stores operate in four formats: discount, Supercenters. Neighborhood Markets, and Sam's Club stores.[35] Walmart International stores include additional formats such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, cash-and-carry stores, home improvement, specialty electronics, restaurants, apparel stores, drugstores, and convenience stores.[148]\n\n\n\n### Walmart U.S.[edit]\n\n\n* ![Walmart in Fajardo, Puerto Rico](image)\n\nWalmart in Fajardo, Puerto Rico\n\n\n**Walmart U.S.** is the company's largest division, accounting for US$331.666 billion, or 65 percent of total sales, for fiscal 2019.[16][17] It consists of three retail formats that have become commonplace in the United States: Supercenters, Discount Stores, Neighborhood Markets, and other small formats. The discount stores sell a variety of mostly non-grocery products, though emphasis has now shifted towards supercenters, which include more groceries. As of October 31, 2022,[update] there are a total of 4,720 Walmart U.S. stores.[2][3] In the United States, 90 percent of the population resides within 10 miles of a Walmart store.[149] The total number of Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs combined is 5,320.[2][3]\n\n\nThe president and CEO of Walmart U.S. is John Furner.[150][151]\n\n\n\n#### Walmart Supercenter[edit]\n\n\n![A Walmart Supercenter store](image)A Walmart Supercenter in Windham, Connecticut (Store #2022)\n**Walmart Supercenters**, branded simply as \"Walmart\", are hypermarkets with sizes varying from 69,000 to 260,000 square feet (6,400 to 24,200 square meters), but averaging about 178,000 square feet (16,500 square meters).[4] These stock general merchandise and a full-service supermarket, including meat and poultry, baked goods, delicatessen, frozen foods, dairy products, garden produce, and fresh seafood. Many Walmart Supercenters also have a garden center, pet shop, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, and numerous alcove shops, such as cellular phone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores, local bank branches (such as Woodforest National Bank branches in newer locations), and fast food outlets.\n\n\nMany Walmart Supercenters currently feature McDonald's or Subway restaurants. In some Canadian locations, Tim Hortons were opened. Recently, in several Supercenters, like the Tallahassee, Florida and the Palm Desert, California locations, Walmart added Burger King to their locations, and the location in Glen Burnie, Maryland, due to its past as a hypermarket called Leedmark, which operated from May 1991 to January 1994, boasts an Auntie Anne's and an Italian restaurant. Some Walmart locations in Canada have Axess Law locations, Mary Brown's, Burger King and McDonald's, and Atlantic Lottery Corporation locations in the Atlantic region. Some US locations have Wendy's, Domino's, Taco Bell, Claire's, and small arcades called GamePlay.\n\n\nSome locations also have fuel stations which sell gasoline distributed by Murphy USA (which spun off from Murphy Oil in 2013), Sunoco (\"Optima\"), the Tesoro Corporation (\"Mirastar\"), USA Gasoline, and even now Walmart-branded gas stations.[152]\n\n\nThe first Supercenter opened in Washington, Missouri, in 1988. A similar concept, Hypermart USA, had opened a year earlier in Garland, Texas. All Hypermart USA stores were later closed or converted into Supercenters.\n\n\nAs of October 31, 2022,[update] there were 3,572 Walmart Supercenters in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.[2][3] Hawaii is the only state to not have a Supercenter location. The largest Supercenter in the world, covering 260,000 square feet (24,000 square meters) on two floors, is located in Crossgates Commons in Albany, New York.[153]\n\n\nA typical supercenter sells approximately 120,000 items, compared to the 35 million products sold in Walmart's online store.[154]\n\n\nThe \"Supercenter\" name has since been phased out, with these stores now simply referred to as \"Walmart\", since the company introduced the new Walmart logo in 2008. However, the branding is still used in Walmart's Canadian stores (spelled as \"Supercentre\" in Canadian English).[155]\n\n\n\n#### Walmart Discount Store[edit]\n\n\n![The exterior of a Walmart Discount Store in Charlotte, North Carolina](image)The exterior of a Walmart Discount Store in Charlotte, North Carolina (Store #1821)\n**Walmart Discount Stores**, also branded as simply \"Walmart\", are discount department stores with sizes varying from 30,000 to 221,000 square feet (2,800 to 20,500 square meters), with the average store covering 105,000 square feet (9,800 square meters).[4] They carry general merchandise and limited groceries. Some newer and remodeled discount stores have an expanded grocery department, similar to Target's PFresh department. Many of these stores also feature a garden center, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, a bank branch, a cell phone store, and a fast food outlet. Some also have gasoline stations.[152] Discount Stores were Walmart's original concept, though they have since been surpassed by Supercenters.[35]\n\n\nIn 1990, Walmart opened its first Bud's Discount City location in Bentonville. Bud's operated as a closeout store, much like Big Lots. Many locations were opened to fulfill leases in shopping centers as Walmart stores left and moved into newly built Supercenters. All of the Bud's Discount City stores had closed or converted into Walmart Discount Stores by 1997.[156]\n\n\nAt its peak in 1996, there were 1,995 Walmart Discount Stores;[157] as of October 31, 2022, that number was dropped to 365.[2][3]\n\n\n\n#### Walmart Neighborhood Market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 24-hour Walmart Neighborhood Market in Valdosta, Georgia (Store #6732)\n**Walmart Neighborhood Market**, sometimes branded as \"Neighborhood Market by Walmart\" or informally known as \"Neighborhood Walmart\",[158] is Walmart's chain of supermarkets ranging from 28,000 to 65,000 square feet (2,600 to 6,000 square meters) and averaging about 42,000 square feet (3,900 square meters), about a fifth of the size of a Walmart Supercenter.[4][159] The first Walmart Neighborhood Market opened ten years after the first Supercenter opened, but Walmart did not focus on the smaller grocery store format until the 2010s.[160]\n\n\nThe stores focus on three of Walmart's major sales categories: groceries, which account for about 55 percent of the company's revenue,[161][162] pharmacy, and, at some stores, fuel.[163] For groceries and consumables, the stores sell fresh produce, deli and bakery items, prepared foods, meat, dairy, organic, general grocery and frozen foods, in addition to cleaning products and pet supplies.[159][164] Some stores offer wine and beer sales[159] and drive-through pharmacies. Some stores, such as one at Midtown Center in Bentonville, Arkansas, offer made-to-order pizza with a seating area for eating.[165] Customers can also use Walmart's site-to-store operation and pick up online orders at Walmart Neighborhood Market stores just like the Supercenters and Discount Stores[166]\n\n\nProducts at Walmart Neighborhood Market stores have the same prices as those at Walmart's larger supercenters. A Moody's Investors Services analyst said the wider company's pricing structure gives the chain of grocery stores a \"competitive advantage\" over competitors Whole Foods Market, Kroger and Trader Joe's.[163]\n\n\nNeighborhood Market stores expanded slowly at first as a way to fill gaps between Walmart Supercenters and Discount Stores in existing markets. In its first 12 years, the company opened about 180 Walmart Neighborhood Markets. By 2010, Walmart said it was ready to accelerate its expansion plans for the grocery stores.[167] As of October 31, 2022,[update] there were 682 Walmart Neighborhood Markets,[2][3] each employing between 90 and 95 full-time and part-time workers.[168] The total number of Neighborhood Markets and other small formats combined is 783.\n\n\nDepending on the area, Neighborhood Market has some competition with Hy-Vee, which launched in 2019, similar to Neighborhood Market.\n\n\n\n#### Former stores and concepts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Walmart Neighborhood Market originally planned to be a Walmart Express in Alma, Georgia in September 2015 (Store #4229). This location closed in 2016 as part of a plan to close 269 stores globally.\nWalmart opened **Supermercado de Walmart** locations to appeal to Hispanic communities in the United States.[169] The first one, a 39,000-square-foot (3,600-square-meter) store in the Spring Branch area of Houston, opened on April 29, 2009.[170] The store was a conversion of an existing Walmart Neighborhood Market.[171] In 2009, another Supermercado de Walmart opened in Phoenix, Arizona.[172] Both locations closed in 2014.[173] In 2009, Walmart opened \"Más Club\", a warehouse retail operation patterned after Sam's Club. Its lone store also closed in 2014.[170]\n\n\n**Walmart Express** was a chain of smaller discount stores with a range of services from groceries to check cashing and gasoline service. The concept was focused on small towns deemed unable to support a larger store and large cities where space was at a premium. Walmart planned to build 15 to 20 Walmart Express stores, focusing on Arkansas, North Carolina, and Chicago, by the end of its fiscal year in January 2012. As of September 2014,[update] Walmart re-branded all 22[174] of its Express format stores to Neighborhood Markets in an effort to streamline its retail offer. It continued to open new Express stores under the Neighborhood Market name. As of October 31, 2022,[update] there were 101 small-format stores in the United States. These include 92 other small formats, 8 convenience stores and 1 pickup location.[2][3] On January 15, 2016, Walmart announced that it would be closing 269 stores globally, including the 102 Neighborhood Markets that were formerly or originally planned to be Express stores.[175]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2022, Walmart owned the Amigo supermarkets chain in Puerto Rico. In 2022, Walmart announced that it would sell its Amigo stores to Pueblo Inc. and focus on modernizing its 18 Supercenter and Division 1 formats and seven Sam's Clubs stores.[176]\n\n\n\n#### Initiatives[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2006, Walmart announced a pilot program to sell generic drugs at $4 per prescription. The program was launched at stores in the Tampa, Florida, area, and by January 2007 had been expanded to all stores in Florida. While the average price of generics is $29 per prescription, compared to $102 for name-brand drugs, Walmart maintains that it is not selling at a loss, or providing them as an act of charity—instead, they are using the same mechanisms of mass distribution that it uses to bring lower prices to other products.[177] Many of Walmart's low cost generics are imported from India, where they are made by drug makers that include Ranbaxy Laboratories and Cipla.[178]\n\n\nOn February 6, 2007, the company launched a \"beta\" version of a movie download service, which sold about 3,000 films and television episodes from all major studios and television networks.[179] The service was discontinued on December 21, 2007, due to low sales.[180]\n\n\nIn 2008, Walmart started a pilot program in the small grocery store concept called Marketside in the metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona area. The four stores closed in 2011.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Walmart Pickup location in Canada\nIn 2015, Walmart began testing a free grocery pickup service, allowing customers to select products online and choose their pickup time. At the store, a Walmart employee loads the groceries into the customer's car. As of December 17, 2017,[update] the service is available in 39 U.S. states.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Walmart announced a change to ShippingPass, its three-day shipping service, and that it will move from a three-day delivery to two-day delivery to remain competitive with Amazon.[183] Walmart priced it at 49 dollars per year, compared to Amazon Prime's 99-dollar-per-year price.[184][185]\n\n\nIn June 2016, Walmart and Sam's Club announced that they would begin testing a last-mile grocery delivery that used services including Uber, Lyft, and Deliv, to bring customers' orders to their homes. Walmart customers would be able to shop using the company's online grocery service at grocery.walmart.com, then request delivery at checkout for a small fee. The first tests were planned to go live in Denver and Phoenix.[186] Walmart announced on March 14, 2018, that it would expand online delivery to 100 metropolitan regions in the United States, the equivalent of 40 percent of households, by the end of the year of 2018.[187]\n\n\nWalmart's Winemakers Selection private label wine was introduced in June 2018 in about 1,100 stores. The wine, from domestic and international sources, was described by *Washington Post* food and wine columnist Dave McIntyre as notably good for the inexpensive ($11 to $16 per bottle) price level.[188]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Walmart announced that customers in 2,000 locations in 29 states can use the grocery pickup service for their adult beverage purchases. Walmart will also deliver adult beverages from nearly 200 stores across California and Florida.[189]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Walmart announced a new membership program called, \"Walmart +\". The news came shortly after Walmart announced the discontinuation of its personal shopping service, Jetblack.[190][191]\n\n\n\n#### Numbers of stores by state[edit]\n\n\nLocations as of October 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n| State | Supercenters | DiscountStores | NeighborhoodMarkets | Amigos | Sam'sClubs | OtherPharmacyFormats | Totalstores\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama[192] | 101\n | 1\n | 28\n |  | 13\n | 1\n | 144\n |\n| Alaska[193] | 7\n | 2\n |  |  |  |  | 9\n |\n| Arizona[194] | 84\n | 2\n | 26\n |  | 12\n |  | 124\n |\n| Arkansas[195] | 76\n | 5\n | 33\n |  | 11\n | 8\n | 133\n |\n| California[196] | 144\n | 68\n | 66\n |  | 30\n | 1\n | 309\n |\n| Colorado[197] | 70\n | 4\n | 14\n |  | 17\n |  | 105\n |\n| Connecticut[198] | 12\n | 21\n |  |  | 1\n |  | 34\n |\n| Delaware[199] | 6\n | 3\n |  |  | 1\n |  | 10\n |\n| District of Columbia[200] | 3\n |  |  |  |  |  | 3\n |\n| Florida[201] | 232\n | 9\n | 98\n |  | 46\n | 2\n | 387\n |\n| Georgia[202] | 154\n | 2\n | 31\n |  | 24\n | 4\n | 215\n |\n| Hawaii[203] |  | 10\n |  |  | 2\n |  | 12\n |\n| Idaho[204] | 23\n |  | 3\n |  | 1\n |  | 27\n |\n| Illinois[205] | 139\n | 15\n | 5\n |  | 25\n |  | 184\n |\n| Indiana[206] | 97\n | 6\n | 9\n |  | 13\n | 2\n | 127\n |\n| Iowa[207] | 58\n | 2\n |  |  | 9\n |  | 69\n |\n| Kansas[208] | 58\n | 2\n | 14\n |  | 9\n |  | 83\n |\n| Kentucky[209] | 77\n | 7\n | 7\n |  | 9\n | 1\n | 101\n |\n| Louisiana[210] | 88\n | 2\n | 33\n |  | 14\n | 1\n | 138\n |\n| Maine[211] | 19\n | 3\n |  |  | 3\n |  | 25\n |\n| Maryland[212] | 31\n | 16\n |  |  | 11\n | 2\n | 60\n |\n| Massachusetts[213] | 27\n | 21\n |  |  |  |  | 48\n |\n| Michigan[214] | 90\n | 3\n |  |  | 23\n | 1\n | 117\n |\n| Minnesota[215] | 65\n | 3\n |  |  | 12\n |  | 80\n |\n| Mississippi[216] | 65\n | 3\n | 10\n |  | 7\n | 1\n | 86\n |\n| Missouri[217] | 112\n | 9\n | 16\n |  | 19\n |  | 156\n |\n| Montana[218] | 14\n |  |  |  | 2\n |  | 16\n |\n| Nebraska[219] | 35\n |  | 7\n |  | 5\n |  | 47\n |\n| Nevada[220] | 30\n | 2\n | 11\n |  | 7\n |  | 50\n |\n| New Hampshire[221] | 19\n | 7\n |  |  | 2\n |  | 28\n |\n| New Jersey[222] | 35\n | 27\n |  |  | 8\n |  | 70\n |\n| New Mexico[223] | 35\n | 2\n | 9\n |  | 7\n |  | 53\n |\n| New York[224] | 82\n | 16\n | 1\n |  | 12\n |  | 111\n |\n| North Carolina[225] | 143\n | 6\n | 43\n |  | 22\n |  | 214\n |\n| North Dakota[226] | 14\n |  |  |  | 3\n |  | 17\n |\n| Ohio[227] | 138\n | 5\n |  |  | 27\n |  | 170\n |\n| Oklahoma[228] | 81\n | 7\n | 33\n |  | 13\n |  | 134\n |\n| Oregon[229] | 29\n | 7\n | 9\n |  |  |  | 45\n |\n| Pennsylvania[230] | 116\n | 20\n |  |  | 24\n |  | 160\n |\n| Puerto Rico[231] | 13\n | 5\n |  | 11\n | 7\n |  | 36\n |\n| Rhode Island[232] | 5\n | 4\n |  |  |  |  | 9\n |\n| South Carolina[233] | 83\n |  | 26\n |  | 13\n |  | 122\n |\n| South Dakota[234] | 15\n |  |  |  | 2\n |  | 17\n |\n| Tennessee[235] | 117\n | 1\n | 18\n |  | 14\n |  | 150\n |\n| Texas[236] | 391\n | 18\n | 97\n |  | 82\n | 5\n | 593\n |\n| Utah[237] | 41\n |  | 10\n |  | 8\n |  | 59\n |\n| Vermont[238] | 3\n | 3\n |  |  |  |  | 6\n |\n| Virginia[239] | 110\n | 4\n | 20\n |  | 15\n |  | 149\n |\n| Washington[240] | 52\n | 9\n | 4\n |  |  |  | 65\n |\n| West Virginia[241] | 38\n |  |  |  | 5\n | 1\n | 44\n |\n| Wisconsin[242] | 83\n | 4\n | 2\n |  | 10\n |  | 99\n |\n| Wyoming[243] | 12\n |  |  |  | 2\n |  | 14\n |\n\n\n### Walmart International[edit]\n\n\nAs of October 31, 2022,[update] Walmart's international operations comprised 5,266 stores[2][3] and 800,000 workers in 23 countries outside the United States.[244] There are wholly owned operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the UK. With 2.2 million employees worldwide, the company is the largest private employer in the U.S. and Mexico, and one of the largest in Canada.[8] In fiscal 2019 Walmart's international division sales were US$120.824 billion, or 23.7 percent of total sales.[16][17] International retail units range from 1,400 to 186,000 square feet (130 to 17,280 square meters), while wholesale units range from 24,000 to 158,000 square feet (2,200 to 14,700 square meters).[4] Judith McKenna is the president and CEO of Walmart International .[245][151]\n\n\n\n#### Central America[edit]\n\n\nWalmart also owns 51 percent of the Central American Retail Holding Company (CARHCO), which, as of October 31, 2022,[update] consists of 868 stores, including 263 stores in Guatemala (under the Paiz [27 locations], Walmart Supercenter [10 locations], Despensa Familiar [181 locations], and Maxi Dispensa [45 locations] banners),[2][3] 102 stores in El Salvador (under the Despensa Familiar [63 locations], La Despensa de Don Juan [17 locations], Walmart Supercenter [6 locations], and Maxi Despensa [16 locations] banners),[2][3] 111 stores in Honduras (including the Paiz [8 locations], Walmart Supercenter [4 locations], Dispensa Familiar [71 locations], and Maxi Despensa [28 locations] banners),[2][3] 102 stores in Nicaragua (including the Pali [71 locations], La Unión [9 locations], Maxi Pali [20

and Pali [189 locations] banners[2][3]).[246]\n\n\n\n#### Chile[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Líder\n\nIn January 2009, the company acquired a controlling interest in the largest grocer in Chile, Distribución y Servicio D&S SA.[247][248] In 2010, the company was renamed Walmart Chile.[249] As of October 31, 2022,[update] Walmart Chile operates 384 stores under the banners Lider Hiper (97 locations), Lider Express (154 locations), Superbodega Acuenta (122 locations), and Central Mayorista (11 locations).[2][3]\n\n\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Walmart de México y Centroamérica\n\n![](image)Walmart in Mexico\nWalmart opened its first international store in Mexico in 1991.[35]\nAs of October 31, 2022,[update] Walmart's Mexico division, the largest outside the U.S., consisted of 2,804 stores.[2][3] Walmart in Mexico operates Walmart Supercenter (300 locations), Sam's Club (167 locations), Bodega Aurrera (571 locations), Mi Bodega Aurrera (438 locations), Bodega Aurrera Express (1,229 locations) and Walmart Express (99 locations).[3]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Walmart Canada\n\n![](image)Walmart Supercentre in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada in September 2017\nWalmart has operated in Canada since it acquired 122 stores comprising the Woolco division of Woolworth Canada, Inc on January 14, 1994.[250] As of October 31, 2022,[update] it operates 402 locations (including 343 supercentres and 59 discount stores)[2][3] and, as of June 2015,[update] it employs 89,358 people, with a local home office in Mississauga, Ontario.[251] Walmart Canada's first three Supercentres (spelled in Canadian English) opened in November 2006 in Ancaster, London, and Stouffville, Ontario.[252] The 100th Canadian Supercentre opened in July 2010, in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\n\nIn 2010, approximately one year after its incorporation of Schedule 2 (foreign-owned, deposit-taking) of Canada's *Bank Act*,[253] Walmart Canada Bank was introduced with the launch of the Walmart (Canada) Rewards MasterCard.[254] Less than ten years later, however, on May 17, 2018, Wal-Mart Canada announced it had reached a definitive agreement to sell Wal-Mart Canada Bank to First National co-founder Stephen Smith and private equity firm Centerbridge Partners, L.P., on undisclosed financial terms, though it added that it would still be issuer of the Walmart (Canada) Rewards MasterCard.[255]\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and Stephen Smith jointly announced the closing of the previously announced acquisition of Wal-Mart Canada Bank and that it was to be renamed Duo Bank of Canada, to be styled simply as Duo Bank.[256][257] Though exact ownership percentages were never revealed in either company announcement, it has also since been revealed that Duo Bank was reclassified as a Schedule 1 (domestic, deposit-taking)[258][259] federally chartered bank of the *Bank Act* in Canada from the Schedule 2 (foreign-owned or -controlled, deposit-taking)[259] that it had been, which indicates that Stephen Smith, as a noted Canadian businessman, is in a controlling position.\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Walmart announced it would buy Massmart Holdings Ltd. of Johannesburg, South Africa in a deal worth over US$4 billion giving the company its first footprint in Africa.[260] As of October 31, 2022,[update] it has 411 stores, including 361 stores in South Africa (under the banners Game Foodco [78 locations], CBW [41 locations], Game [39 locations], Builders Express [50 locations], Builders Warehouse [34 locations], Cambridge [42 locations], Rhino [15 locations], Makro [23 locations], Builders Trade Depot [8 locations], Jumbo [13 locations], and Builders Superstore [18 locations]),[2][3] 11 stores in Botswana (under the banners CBW [7 locations], Game Foodco [2 locations], and Builders Warehouse [2 locations]),[2][3] 4 stores in Ghana (under the Game Foodco banner),[2][3] 4 stores in Kenya (under the banners Game Foodco [3 locations] and Builders Warehouse [1 location]),[2][3] 3 stores in Lesotho (under the banners CBW [2 locations] and Game Foodco [1 location]),[2] 2 stores in Malawi (under the Game banner),[2][3] 6 stores in Mozambique (under the banners Builders Warehouse [2 locations], Game Foodco [2 locations], CBW [1 location], and Builders Express [1 location]),[2][3] 5 stores in Namibia (under the banners Game Foodco [4 locations] and Game [1 location]),[2][3] 5 stores in Nigeria (under the banners Game [3 locations] and Game Foodco [2 location]),[2][3] 1 store in Swaziland (under the CBW banner),[2][3] 1 store in Tanzania (under the Game Foodco banner),[2][3] 1 store in Uganda (under the Game banner),[2][3] and 7 stores in Zambia (under the banners CBW [1 location], Game Foodco [3 locations], Builders Warehouse [2 locations], and Builders Express [1 location]).[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\n![An aisle in a Walmart store in China](image)A Walmart in Hangzhou, China in February 2017\nWalmart has joint ventures in China and several majority-owned subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2022,[update] Walmart China (沃尔玛 *Wò'ērmǎ*)[261] operates 369 stores under the Walmart Supercenter (330 locations) and Sam's Club (39 locations) banners.[2][3]\n\n\nIn February 2012, Walmart announced that the company raised its stake to 51 percent in Chinese online supermarket Yihaodian to tap rising consumer wealth and help the company offer more products. Walmart took full ownership in July 2015.[262]\n\n\nIn December 2021, the Chinese Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection warned Walmart about not stocking products made from inputs from Xinjiang in response to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.[263]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2006, the company announced a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises to operate in India. As foreign corporations were not allowed to enter the retail sector directly, Walmart operated through franchises and handled the wholesale end of the business.[264] The partnership involved two joint ventures—Bharti manages the front end, involving opening of retail outlets while Walmart takes care of the back end, such as cold chains and logistics. Walmart operates stores in India under the name Best Price Modern Wholesale.[265] The first store opened in Amritsar on May 30, 2009. On September 14, 2012, the Government of India approved 51 percent FDI in multi-brand retails, subject to approval by individual states, effective September 20, 2012.[266][267] Scott Price, Walmart's president and CEO for Asia, told *The Wall Street Journal* that the company would be able to start opening Walmart stores in India within two years.[268] Expansion into India faced some significant problems. In November 2012, Walmart admitted to spending US$25 million lobbying the Indian National Congress;[269] lobbying is conventionally considered bribery in India.[270] Walmart is conducting an internal investigation into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[271] Bharti Walmart suspended a number of employees, rumored to include its CFO and legal team, to ensure \"a complete and thorough investigation\".[272] In October 2013, Bharti and Walmart separated to pursue business independently.[273]\n\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Walmart announced its intent to acquire a 77% majority stake in the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart for $16 billion, in a deal that was completed on August 18, 2018.[274][275][276] As of October 31, 2022,[update] there are 28 Best Price Modern Wholesale locations.[2][3]\n\n\n\n#### Setbacks[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Walmart tried with a large financial investment to get a foothold in both German and Indonesian retail markets.\n\n\nWalmart entered Indonesia with the opening of stores in Lippo Supermall (now known as Supermal Karawaci) and Megamall Pluit (now known as Pluit Village) respectively, under a joint-venture agreement with local conglomerate Lippo Group. Both stores closed down due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[277][278][279]\n\n\nIn 1997, Walmart took over the supermarket chain Wertkauf with its 21 stores for DM 750 million[280] and the following year Walmart acquired 74 Interspar stores for DM 1.3 billion.[281][282] The German market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among companies which used a similar low price strategy as Walmart. As a result, Walmart's low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage. Walmart's corporate culture was not viewed positively among employees and customers, particularly Walmart's \"statement of ethics\", which attempted to restrict relationships between employees, a possible violation of German labor law, and led to a public discussion in the media, resulting in a bad reputation among customers.[283][284] In July 2006, Walmart announced its withdrawal from Germany due to sustained losses. The stores were sold to the German company Metro during Walmart's fiscal third quarter.[285][286] Walmart did not disclose its losses from its German investment, but they were estimated to be around €3 billion.[287]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hiper Bompreço in Natal, Brazil in May 2008\nIn 2004, Walmart bought the 118 stores in the Bompreço supermarket chain in northeastern Brazil. In late 2005, it took control of the Brazilian operations of Sonae Distribution Group through its new subsidiary, WMS Supermercados do Brasil, thus acquiring control of the Nacional and Mercadorama supermarket chains, the leaders in the Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná states, respectively. None of these stores were rebranded. As of January 2014,[update] Walmart operated 61 Bompreço supermarkets, 39 Hiper Bompreço stores. It also ran 57 Walmart Supercenters, 27 Sam's Clubs, and 174 Todo Dia stores. With the acquisition of Bompreço and Sonae, by 2010, Walmart was the third-largest supermarket chain in Brazil, behind Carrefour and Pão de Açúcar.[288]\n\n\nWalmart Brasil, the operating company, has its head office in Barueri, São Paulo State, and regional offices in Curitiba, Paraná; Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul; Recife, Pernambuco; and Salvador, Bahia.[289] Walmart Brasil operates under the banners Todo Dia, Nacional, Bompreço, Walmart Supercenter, Maxxi Atacado, Hipermercado Big, Hiper Bompreço, Sam's Club, Mercadorama, Walmart Posto (Gas Station), Supermercado Todo Dia, and Hiper Todo Dia. Recently, the company started the conversion process of all Hiper Bompreço and Big stores into Walmart Supercenters and Bompreço, Nacional and Mercadorama stores into the Walmart Supermercado brand.\n\n\nSince August 2018, Walmart Inc. only holds a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, which was renamed Grupo Big on August 12, 2019,[290] with 20% of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80% ownership of the company.[291] On March 24, 2021, it was announced that Carrefour would be acquiring Grupo Big.[292]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Walmart Supercenter in Argentina in February 2019\nWalmart Argentina was founded in 1995 and operates stores under the banners Walmart Supercenter, Changomas, Mi Changomas, and Punto Mayorista. On November 6, 2020, it was announced that Walmart has sold its Argentine operations to Grupo de Narváez and renamed Hiper Changomas.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)ASDA Supermarket in Fife, Scotland\nWalmart's UK subsidiary Asda (which retained its name after being acquired by Walmart) is based in Leeds and accounted for 42.7  percent of 2006 sales of Walmart's international division. In contrast to the U.S. operations, Asda was originally and still remains primarily a grocery chain, but with a stronger focus on non-food items than most UK supermarket chains other than Tesco. In 2010 Asda acquired stores from Netto UK. In addition to small suburban Asda Supermarkets,[3] larger stores are branded Supercentres.[3] Other banners include Asda Superstores, Asda Living, and Asda Petrol Fueling Station.[2][3][294] In July 2015, Asda updated its logo featuring the Walmart Asterisks behind the first 'A' in the Logo. In May 2018, Walmart announced plans to sell Asda to rival Sainsbury's for $10.1 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Walmart would have received a 42% stake in the combined company and about £3 billion in cash.[295] However, in April 2019, the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority blocked the proposed sale of Asda to Sainsburys.[296]\n\n\nOn October 2, 2020, it was announced that Walmart will sell a majority stake of Asda to a consortium of Zuber and Mohsin Issa (the owners of EG Group) and private equity firm TDR Capital for £6.8bn, pending approval from the Competition and Markets Authority.[297]\n\n\nIn Japan, Walmart owned 100 percent of Seiyu (西友 *Seiyū*) as of 2008.[update][285][298] It operates under the Seiyu (Hypermarket), Seiyu (Supermarket), Seiyu (General Merchandise), Livin, and Sunny banners.[2][3] \nOn November 16, 2020, Walmart announced they would be selling 65% of their shares in the company to the private-equity firm KKR in a deal valuing 329 stores and 34,600 employees at $1.6 billion. Walmart is supposed to retain 15% and a seat on the board, while a joint-venture between KKR and Japanese company Rakuten Inc. will receive 20%.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Corruption charges[edit]\n\n\nAn April 2012 investigation by *The New York Times* reported the allegations of a former executive of Walmart de Mexico that, in September 2005, the company had paid bribes via local fixers to officials throughout Mexico in exchange for construction permits, information, and other favors, which gave Walmart a substantial advantage over competitors.[300] Walmart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken. Concerns were also raised that Walmart executives in the United States had \"hushed up\" the allegations. A follow-up investigation by *The New York Times*, published December 17, 2012, revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting, construction, and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery. There was evidence that a bribe of US$52,000 was paid to change a zoning map, which enabled the opening of a Walmart store a mile from a historical site in San Juan Teotihuacán in 2004.[301] After the initial article was released, Walmart released a statement denying the allegations and describing its anti-corruption policy. While an official Walmart report states that it had found no evidence of corruption, the article alleges that previous internal reports had indeed turned up such evidence before the story became public.[302] *Forbes* magazine contributor Adam Hartung also commented that the bribery scandal was a reflection of Walmart's \"serious management and strategy troubles\", stating, \"[s]candals are now commonplace ... [e]ach scandal points out that Walmart's strategy is harder to navigate and is running into big problems\".[303]\n\n\nIn 2012, there was an incident with CJ's Seafood, a crawfish processing firm in Louisiana that was partnered with Walmart, that eventually gained media attention for the mistreatment of its 40 H-2B visa workers from Mexico. These workers experienced harsh living conditions in tightly packed trailers outside of the work facility, physical threats, verbal abuse, and were forced to work day-long shifts. Many of the workers were afraid to take action about the abuse due to the fact that the manager threatened the lives of their family members in the U.S. and Mexico if the abuse were to be reported. Eight of the workers confronted management at CJ's Seafood about the mistreatment; however, the management denied the abuse allegations and the workers went on strike. The workers then took their stories to Walmart due to their partnership with CJ's. While Walmart was investigating the situation, the workers collected 150,000 signatures of supporters who agreed that Walmart should stand by the workers and take action. In June 2012, the visa workers held a protest and day-long hunger strike outside of the apartment building where a Walmart board member resided. Following this protest, Walmart announced its final decision to no longer work with CJ's Seafood. Less than a month later, the Department of Labor fined CJ's Seafood \"approximately $460,000 in back-pay, safety violations, wage and hour violations, civil damages, and fines for abuses to the H-2B program. The company has since shut down.\"[304]\n\n\nAs of December 2012,[update] internal investigations were ongoing into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[305] Walmart has invested US$99 million on internal investigations, which expanded beyond Mexico to implicate operations in China, Brazil, and India.[306][307] The case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity, or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by \"foreign financial and corporate interests\".[308][309]\n\n\n\n### Sam's Club[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sam's Club\n\n**Sam's Club** is a chain of warehouse clubs that sell groceries and general merchandise, often in bulk.[35] Locations generally range in size from 32,000–168,000 sq ft (3,000–15,600 m2), with an average club size of approximately 134,000 sq ft (12,400 m2).[4] The first Sam's Club was opened by Walmart, Inc. in 1983 in Midwest City, Oklahoma[310] under the name \"Sam's Wholesale Club\". The chain was named after its founder Sam Walton. As of October 31, 2022, Sam's Club operated 600 membership warehouse clubs and accounted for 11.3% of Walmart's revenue at $57.839 billion in fiscal year 2019.[16][311] Kathryn McLay is the president and CEO of Sam's Club.[151][312]\n\n\n\n### Global eCommerce[edit]\n\n\nBased in San Bruno, California, Walmart's Global eCommerce division provides online retailing for Walmart, Sam's Club, Asda, and all other international brands. There are several locations in the United States in California and Oregon: San Bruno, Sunnyvale, Brisbane, and Portland. Locations outside of the United States include Shanghai (China), Leeds (United Kingdom), and Bangalore (India).\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n### Private label brands[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Walmart brands\n\nAbout 40 percent of products sold in Walmart are private labels, which are produced for the company through contracts with manufacturers. Walmart began offering private label brands in 1991, with the launch of Sam's Choice, a line of drinks produced by Cott Beverages for Walmart. Sam's Choice quickly became popular and by 1993, was the third-most-popular beverage brand in the United States.[313] Other Walmart brands include Great Value and Equate in the U.S. and Canada and Smart Price in Britain. A 2006 study talked of \"the magnitude of mind-share Walmart appears to hold in the shoppers' minds when it comes to the awareness of private label brands and retailers.\"[314]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, the company teamed with Procter & Gamble to produce *Secrets of the Mountain* and *The Jensen Project*, two-hour family movies which featured the characters using Walmart and Procter & Gamble-branded products. *The Jensen Project* also featured a preview of a product to be released in several months in Walmart stores.[315][316] A third movie, *A Walk in My Shoes*, also aired in 2010 and a fourth is in production.[*when?*][317] Walmart's director of brand marketing also serves as co-chair of the Association of National Advertisers's Alliance for Family Entertainment.[318]\n\n\n\n## Online commerce acquisitions and plans[edit]\n\n\nLaunched in 2009, Walmart's Marketplace stayed dormant until 2016 when Walmart purchased e-commerce company Jet.com, founded in 2014 by Marc Lore, to start competing with Amazon.com[319]. Jet.com has acquired its own share of online retailers such as Hayneedle in March 2016, Shoebuy.com in December 2016, and ModCloth in March 2017. Walmart also acquired Parcel, a delivery service in New York, on September 29, 2017.[320][321]\n\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Walmart acquired Moosejaw, an online active outdoor retailer, for approximately $51 million. Moosejaw brought with it partnerships with more than 400 brands, including Patagonia, The North Face, Marmot, and Arc'teryx.[322]\n\n\nMarc Lore, Walmart's U.S. e-commerce CEO, said that Walmart's existing physical infrastructure of almost 5,000 stores around the U.S. will enhance their digital expansion by doubling as warehouses for e-commerce without increasing overhead.[323] As of 2017,[update] Walmart offers in-store pickup for online orders at 1,000 stores with plans to eventually expand the service to all of its stores.[324]\n\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Walmart announced its intent to acquire a 77% controlling stake in the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart for $16 billion[325] (beating bids by Amazon.com), subject to regulatory approval. Following its completion, the website's management will report to Marc Lore.[326][327][328] Completion of the deal was announced on August 18, 2018.[329]\n\n\nThe company's partnership with subscription service Kidbox was announced on April 16, 2019.[330]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![An American flag waving above a Walmart sign at the entrance of an office park](image)Home office in Bentonville, Arkansas in June 2009\nWalmart is headquartered in the Walmart Home Office complex in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company's business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices.[11] Doug McMillon became Walmart's CEO on February 1, 2014. He has also worked as the head of Sam's Club and Walmart International.[331] The company refers to its employees as \"associates\". All Walmart stores in the U.S. and Canada also have designated \"greeters\" at the entrance, a practice pioneered by Sam Walton and later imitated by other retailers. Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions.[332]\n\n\nFor many years, associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest, but this practice was discontinued in June 2007 and replaced with khaki pants and polo shirts. The wardrobe change was part of a larger corporate overhaul to increase sales and rejuvenate the company's stock price.[333] In September 2014, the uniform was again updated to bring back a vest (paid for by the company) for store employees over the same polos and khaki or black pants paid for by the employee. The vest is navy blue for Walmart employees at Supercenters and discounts stores, lime green for Walmart Neighborhood Market employees, and yellow for self-check-out associates; door greeters, and customer service managers. All three state \"Proud Walmart Associate\" on the left breast and the \"Spark\" logo covering the back.[334] Reportedly one of the main reasons the vest was reintroduced was that some customers had trouble identifying employees.[335] In 2016, self-checkout associates, door greeters and customer service managers began wearing a yellow vest to be better seen by customers. By requiring employees to wear uniforms that are made up of standard \"streetwear\", Walmart is not required to purchase the uniforms or reimburse employees which are required in some states, as long as that clothing can be worn elsewhere. Businesses are only legally required to pay for branded shirts and pants or clothes that would be difficult to wear outside of work.[336]\n\n\nUnlike many other retailers, Walmart does not charge slotting fees to suppliers for their products to appear in the store.[337] Instead, it focuses on selling more-popular products and provides incentives for store managers to drop unpopular products.[337]\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, the company eliminated its layaway program. In 2011, the company revived its layaway program.[338][339]\n\n\nWalmart introduced its Site-To-Store program in 2007, after testing the program since 2004 on a limited basis. The program allows *walmart.com* customers to buy goods online with a free shipping option, and have goods shipped to the nearest store for pickup.[340]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2017, Walmart announced that it would build a new headquarters in Bentonville to replace its current 1971 building and consolidate operations that have spread out to 20 different buildings throughout Bentonville.[341]\n\n\nAccording to watchdog group Documented, in 2020 Walmart contributed $140,000 to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a fund-raising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association.[342]\n\n\n\n### Finance and governance[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019, Walmart reported net income of US$6.67 billion on $514.405 billion of revenue. The company's international operations accounted for $120.824 billion, or 23.7 percent, of its $510.329 billion of sales.[16][7] Walmart is the world's 23rd-largest public corporation, according to the Forbes Global 2000 list, and the largest public corporation when ranked by revenue.[343]\n\n\nWalmart is governed by an eleven-member board of directors elected annually by shareholders. Gregory B. Penner, son-in-law of S. Robson Walton and the grandson-in-law of Sam Walton, serves as chairman of the board. Doug McMillon serves as president and chief executive officer. Current members of the board are:[344][7][345]\n\n\n\n* Gregory B. Penner, chairman of the board of directors of Walmart Inc. and general partner of Madrone Capital Partners\n* Cesar Conde, chairman of NBCUniversal International Group and NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises\n* Timothy P. Flynn, retired CEO of KPMG International\n* Sarah Friar, CEO of Nextdoor\n* Carla A. Harris, Vice-chairman of Wealth Management, head of multicultural client strategy, managing director, and senior client advisor at Morgan Stanley\n* Tom Horton, senior advisor at Warburg Pincus, LLC, and retired chairman and CEO of American Airlines\n* Marissa A. Mayer, co-founder of Lumi Labs, Inc., and former president and CEO of Yahoo!, Inc.\n* Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart\n* Randall Stephenson, retired chairman and CEO of AT&T Inc.\n* S. Robson \"Rob\" Walton, retired chairman of the board of directors of Walmart Inc.\n* Steuart Walton, founder of RZC Investments, LLC.\n\n\nNotable former members of the board include Hillary Clinton (1985–1992)[346] and Tom Coughlin (2003–2004), the latter having served as vice chairman. Clinton left the board before the 1992 U.S. presidential election, and Coughlin left in December 2005 after pleading guilty to wire fraud and tax evasion for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Walmart.[347]\n\n\nAfter Sam Walton's death in 1992, Don Soderquist, Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice Chairman, became known as the \"Keeper of the Culture\".[348]\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial and

Exchange Commission, with its registered office located in Wolters Kluwer's Corporation Trust Center in Wilmington. As of March 2017,[update][396] it has 3,292,377,090 outstanding shares. These are held mainly by the Walton family, a number of institutions and funds.[6][397]\n\n\n\n* 43.00% (1,415,891,131): Walton Enterprises LLC\n* 5.30% (174,563,205): Walton family Holdings Trust[398]\n* 3.32% (102,036,399): The Vanguard Group, Inc\n* 2.37% (72,714,226): State Street Corporation\n* 1.37% (42,171,892): BlackRock Institutional Trust Company\n* 0.94% (28,831,721): Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund\n* 0.77% (23,614,578): BlackRock Fund Advisors\n* 0.71% (21,769,126): Dodge & Cox Inc\n* 0.68% (20,978,727): Vanguard 500 Index Fund\n* 0.65% (20,125,838): Bank of America Corporation\n* 0.57% (17,571,058): Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n* 0.57% (17,556,128): Northern Trust Corporation\n* 0.55% (16,818,165): Vanguard Institutional Index Fund-Institutional Index Fund\n* 0.55% (16,800,850): State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co\n* 0.52% (15,989,827): SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\n\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nIn North America, Walmart's primary competitors include grocery stores and department stores like Target, Kroger, Aldi, Meijer, Trader Joe's, Ingles, Publix, Harris Teeter and Winn Dixie in the United States; Hudson's Bay, Loblaw retail stores, Sobeys, Metro, and Giant Tiger in Canada; and Comercial Mexicana and Soriana in Mexico. Competitors of Walmart's Sam's Club division are Costco and the smaller BJ's Wholesale Club chain. Walmart's move into the grocery business in the late 1990s set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada.[399] Studies have typically found that Walmart's prices are significantly lower than those of their competitors, and that Walmart's presence is associated with lower food prices for households. Comparisons of performance metrics such as sales per square foot suggest that supermarkets in direct competition with Walmart Supercenters show significant decreases in profit margins, an effect that is strongest in the case of unionized competitors. Between 2000 and 2010, Walmart's entry into new areas often lowered local food prices at other stores. However, recent studies have not found the same effect, suggesting that retailers may have changed their competitive strategies.[35]\n\n\nWhile the idea that Walmart destroys small businesses is widely assumed to be true, research so far suggests that Walmart superstores have little effect on smaller retailers such as \"Mom and Pop\" businesses. Differences in impact appear to be specific to the goods sold. Small retailers may experience difficulty if they rely on selling products identical to those at Walmart or if they try to sell at lower prices.[35]\nDollar stores such as Family Dollar and Dollar General have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against Walmart.[399] In 2004, Walmart responded by testing its own dollar store concept, a subsection of some stores called \"Pennies-n-Cents\".[400][35]\n\n\nWalmart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets. For example, in Germany it had captured just 2 percent of the German food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained \"a secondary player\" behind Aldi with 19 percent.[401]\n\n\nIn May 2006, after entering the South Korean market in 1998, Walmart sold all 16 of its South Korean outlets to Shinsegae, a local retailer, for US$882 million. Shinsegae re-branded the Walmarts as E-mart stores.[402]\n\n\nWalmart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas. In China, Walmart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens. For example, it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood; stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks, leading to higher sales.[403]\n\n\n\n### Customer base[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Walmart locations in the United States, as of December 2020[update]\nIn the United States, Walmart's early growth occurred in the Southeast and lower Midwest. More recently, Walmart has expanded throughout the country. The number of Walmart stores per 1,000 people in 2019 was highest in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama and Kansas, and lowest in Hawaii, California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York. California and New Jersey were two of the ten states with the largest increases in Supercenters between 2011 and 2020, along with Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin.[35]\n\n\nWalmart customers display strong customer loyalty[404] and cite low prices as the most important reason for shopping there. Walmart has characterized their shoppers as falling into three main groups: \"value-price shoppers\" (people who like low prices and cannot afford much more), \"brand aspirationals\" (people with low incomes who buy well-known brands in hopes of assuring quality), and \"price-sensitive affluents\" (wealthier shoppers who seek deals).[405] As of 2022[update] the average U.S. Walmart customer earned about $80,000 per year,[404] above the U.S. average personal income of $63,214.[406] Walmart reports that during times of rising inflation, customers become more sensitive to rising food prices, buying less expensive food items such as hot dogs and canned tuna rather than deli cold cuts. They also see more upper-income shoppers looking for bargains.[407]\n\n\nWalmart shoppers have been reported to be politically conservative. A poll after the 2004 US presidential election reported that 76 percent of voters who shopped at Walmart once a week reported voting for George W. Bush while only 23 percent supported senator John Kerry.[408] When measured against similar retailers in the U.S. in 2006, frequent Walmart shoppers were rated the most politically conservative.[409] As of 2014[update] 54 percent of Americans who preferred to shop at Walmart reported that they opposed same-sex marriage, while 40 percent were in favor, reflecting the store's southern roots.[410]\n\n\nDue to its concentration of stores in the Bible Belt, Walmart is known for its \"tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers\".[411] Walmart has carried clean versions of hip-hop audio CDs and in cooperation with The Timothy Plan, placed \"plastic sheathes over suggestive women's periodicals and banned 'lad mags' such as Maxim\" magazine.[411] Walmart also caters to its Christian customer base by selling Christian books and media,[412] such as VeggieTales videos and The Purpose-Driven Life, earning the company over US$1 billion annually.[413][414]\n\n\nIn 2006, Walmart took steps to expand its U.S. customer base, announcing a modification in its U.S. stores from a \"one-size-fits-all\" merchandising strategy to one designed to \"reflect each of six demographic groups—African-Americans, the affluent, empty-nesters, Hispanics, suburbanites, and rural residents.\"[415] Around six months later, it unveiled a new slogan: *\"Saving people money so they can live better lives\"*.[405]\n\n\nWalmart has also made steps to appeal to more liberal customers, for example, by rejecting the American Family Association's recommendations and carrying the DVD *Brokeback Mountain*, a love story between two gay cowboys in Wyoming.[416]\n\n\n\n### Sales of guns and ammunition[edit]\n\n\nWalmart stopped selling handguns in all U.S. states, except for Alaska, in 1993.[417]\n\n\nIn 2018, Walmart stopped selling guns and ammunition to persons younger than 21, following a similar move by Dick's Sporting Goods on the same day.[418] In the same year, Walmart stopped selling military-style rifles that were commonly used in mass shootings.[417]\n\n\nAs of 2019, Walmart was a major retailer of firearms and ammunition.[419] In 2019, after 23 people[420] were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, Walmart announced that it would stop selling all handgun ammunition and certain short-barreled rifle ammunition.[419] The company also announced that it would stop selling handguns in Alaska, the only state where the company still sold handguns.[418] The move was expected to reduce Walmart's U.S. market share in ammunition from around 20% to around 6–9%.[418] Walmart also stated that it was \"respectfully requesting\" that customers not openly carry weapons in Walmart stores, except for authorized law enforcement officers.[419][418]\n\n\nFollowing the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. in October 2020, Walmart temporarily removed gun and ammunition displays in thousands of stores across the U.S. from sales floors, grounding their reason in concerns of civil unrest. Company spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a statement that \"We have seen some isolated civil unrest and as we have done on several occasions over the last few years, we have moved our firearms and ammunition off the sales floor as a precaution for the safety of our associates and customers.\" Firearms and ammunition will still be available for purchase on request, but the duration of the removal of both from the sales floor remains undetermined.[421]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\n#### Open source software[edit]\n\n\nMany Walmart technology projects are coded in the open and available through the Walmart Labs GitHub repository[422] as open-source software under the OSI approved Apache V2.0 license. As of November 2016,[update] 141 public GitHub projects are listed.\n\n\nDuring a migration of the walmart.com retail platform to Facebook React and Node.js, the Electrode[423] project was created to power the e-commerce platform which serves 80 million visitors per month and 15 million items.\n\n\nThe electrode provides various developer enhancements and tools for the developer including Node.js configuration and feature management.\n\n\nAlex Grigoryan[424] of Walmart Labs released a statement[425] on Medium.com on October 3, 2016, explaining the details of the applications and the scale that they operate at Walmart.\n\n\n\n#### Big data analytics[edit]\n\n\nAs the largest retailer in the U.S., Walmart collects and analyzes a large amount of consumer data. The big data sets are mined for use in predictive analytics, which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customer's habits. Walmart's datacenter is unofficially referred to as Area 71.[426]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Walmart acquired Kosmix to develop software for analyzing real-time data streams.[427] In August 2012, Walmart announced its Polaris search engine.[428]\n\n\nThe amount of data gathered by Walmart has raised privacy concerns.[429][430][431]\n\n\n\n#### Cash handling[edit]\n\n\nin 2016, Walmart began a drive to automate much of the cash handling process. Walmart began replacing employees who count currency by hand with machines that count 8 bills per second and 3,000 coins a minute. The processing machines, located in the back of stores, allow cashiers to process the money for electronic depositing.[432][433]\n\n\n\n## Charity[edit]\n\n\nSam Walton believed that the company's contribution to society was that it operated efficiently, thereby lowering the cost of living for customers, and, therefore, in that sense was a \"powerful force for good\", despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes.[434] Having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a \"handout\", he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education, they could not be expected to \"solve every personal problem that comes to [their] attention\". He explained later in his autobiography, \"We feel very strongly that Wal-Mart really is *not*, and *should not* be, in the charity business,\" stating \"any debit has to be passed along to somebody—either shareholders or our customers.\"[435] Since Sam Walton's death in 1992, however, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation dramatically increased charitable giving. For example, in 2005, Walmart donated US$20 million in cash and merchandise for Hurricane Katrina relief and in 2020 they committed $25 million to organizations on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic response.[436] Today, Walmart's charitable donations approach US$1 billion each year.[437]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nAs of January 2021, healthcare workers could get vaccines through Walmart in New Mexico and Arkansas. Walmart planned to offer vaccines in Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas, Chicago and Puerto Rico with the target of delivering between 10 million and 13 million doses per month at full capacity.[438][439][440]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Walmart said that starting from May 18 all its fully vaccinated employees can stop wearing masks at work following the guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[441]\n\n\n\n## Economic impact[edit]\n\n\n### Effects on customers[edit]\n\n\nA 2005 story in *The Washington Post* reported that \"Wal-Mart's discounting on food alone boosts the welfare of American shoppers by at least US$50 billion per year.\"[442] A study in 2005 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) measured the effect on consumer welfare and found that the poorest segment of the population benefits the most from the existence of discount retailers.[443] \nIn 2006, American newspaper columnist George Will stated that In terms of economic effects, \"Wal-Mart and its effects save shoppers more than US$200 billion a year, dwarfing such government programs as food stamps (US$28.6 billion) and the earned income tax credit (US$34.6 billion)\".[444]\n\n\n\n### Effects on retailers[edit]\n\n\nKenneth Stone, Professor of Economics at Iowa State University, in a paper published in *Farm Foundation* (1997), found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening. Presumably, people who previously shopped in towns without Wal-Mart stores choose to shop in towns with Wal-Mart stores, part of an older pattern in which smaller centers lose retail sales to larger ones. Stone compared the changes to previous competitors that small town shops have faced in the past, such as the development of the railroads, the Sears Roebuck catalog, and shopping malls. He concluded that small towns are more affected by \"discount mass merchandiser stores\" than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever-changing retail market can \"co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment.\"[63] In later research Artz and Stone (2006) reported that in Mississippi the impact of opening a Walmart was much larger on existing retailers in rural communities (17%) than more urban ones (4%).[35][445] This also suggests that Walmart has achieved its strongest growth in non-metropolitan areas, which tend to be low-income.[35]\n\n\nStudies of the impact of Walmart tend to focus on Supercenters rather than Neighborhood Markets. Comparisons of performance metrics such as sales per square foot suggest that supermarkets and other high-volume retailers in direct competition with Walmart Supercenters show significant decreases in profit margins.[35] While Walmart has often been said to be a destroyer of small businesses, much of this is anecdotal. Research so far suggests that Walmart superstores have little effect on smaller retailers such as \"Mom and Pop\" businesses.[35] A 2008 economic analysis published in the journal *Economic Inquiry* suggested that \"the process of creative destruction unleashed by Wal‐Mart has had no statistically significant long‐run impact on the overall size and profitability of the small business sector in the United States.\"[446]\n\n\nImpact appears to be related to a number of factors, with a key factor being the goods offered for sale.[35] A study by Ailawadi and others (2010) examined the impact of new Walmarts in detail. She reported that median sales dropped 40 percent at similar high-volume stores, 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at drugstores. However, 30 percent of specific product categories at high-volume stores were unaffected. Many retailers reduced prices and cut product selection in an attempt to compete directly with Walmart, in effect attacking its areas of strength. A more successful approach was to track sales, identify vulnerable categories, and increase the range of products in those categories. By including products at both top and bottom price points, and offering temporary promotions on those items, retailers could attract both customers who were price-conscious and those interested in a wider range of options. A small store that specialized in a particular product area could compete effectively against Walmart.[447][448] Small specialized stores are less effective against big-box category killer chains such as Home Depot and Best Buy electronics.[449]\n\n\nSome studies have suggested that the impact a Walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from the store. David Merriman, Joseph Persky, Julie Davis and Ron Baiman (2012) outlined the impacts of Walmart in Chicago. Based on three annual surveys of enterprises within a four-mile radius of a new Chicago Walmart it \"shows that the probability of going out of business was significantly higher for establishments close to that store\". The overall findings of this study reinforce the \"contention that large-city Walmarts, like those in small towns, absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly expanding the market\".[450] Ellickson & Grieco (2013) report in the *Journal of Urban Economics* that Wal-Marts most strongly affect outlets of larger chains that are within 2 miles (3.2 km) of their location.[451]\n\n\n\n### Effects on jobs[edit]\n\n\nA 2022 literature review concludes that \"there is no consensus on the impact of Walmart on local employment, but most studies on the topic point to a modest increase in retail employment\".[35] For example, studies at the University of Missouri found that a new store increases net retail employment in the county by 100 jobs in the short term, half of which disappear over five years as other retail establishments close.[452][453] Similarly, a net increase in employment (55 jobs) was found in a study of West Virginia counties between 1989 and 1998.[454]\n\n\nLike other chain stores, Walmart tends to hire local employees for low-skilled jobs with low wages and minimal benefits.[35] This may increase employees' reliance on public assistance programs, effectively transferring costs away from employers onto taxpayers.[449] Studies examining aggregate retail wage data from states and counties, before and after the arrival of Walmart, are mixed. Some results, particularly from nonmetropolitan areas in the South and central United States, suggest lowered wages. Other studies have found no effect (e.g. Pennsylvania) or an increase in wages (e.g. Maryland).[449] A 2004 paper by Goetz and Swaminathan suggested that U.S. counties with Walmart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without Wal-Marts.[455] It is difficult to distinguish the effects of opening a Walmart from other factors that occur in the same time and place, some of which may be related to the decision to open a store. Known as endogeneity bias, this makes it difficult to determine whether Walmart chooses to establish itself in communities with greater poverty and joblessness, or creates more poverty and joblessness.[449]\n\n\nStudies of socioeconomic well-being, civic participation, and community welfare suggest that large non-locally owned businesses tend to be centralized and vertically integrated, rely on remote sources and support services, and move money, expertise and power away from local communities. Large externally-oriented businesses tend to be associated with lower local standards of living, greater inequality, and less social and civic participation. In contrast, locally oriented businesses are associated with higher rates of church membership, community engagement, civic improvement and recreation. They may also be associated with higher rates of home-ownership and expenditures on health and public schools. The presence of local entrepreneurs with resources and motivation to invest in local communities may be key to addressing community problems. This research is not specific to Walmart, but to large businesses in general.[449]\n\n\nIn broader economic terms, the Economic Policy Institute estimated that between 2001 and 2006 Wal-Mart's trade deficit with China alone represented a loss of nearly 200,000 U.S. jobs. During this period, Wal-Mart was responsible for 9.3% of total U.S. imports from China, increasing the U.S. trade deficit by an estimated $17.1 billion. This represents about 200,000 jobs, most of them in the manufacturing sector (133,000).[456]\n\n\nA 2014 story in *The Guardian* reported that the Wal-Mart Foundation was boosting its efforts to work with U.S. manufacturers. In February 2014, the Walmart Foundation pledged to support domestic manufacturers by buying US$250 billion worth of American-made products in the next decade.[457] Between 2014 and 2017, the Walmart U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund gave $10 million in grants to research and academic institutions for projects that improve domestic manufacturing.[458] For the 2020 fiscal year, Walmart reported that nearly two-thirds of its merchandise was made, assembled or grown in the United States. As of March 2021, Walmart pledged to buy an additional $350 billion worth of American-based items over the next decade.[459]\n\n\n\n### Effects on productivity[edit]\n\n\nA 2001 McKinsey Global Institute study of U.S. labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 concluded that \"Wal-Mart directly and indirectly caused the bulk of the productivity acceleration\" in general merchandise, representing 16 percent of total productivity growth in the retail sector.[460]\nWalmart's transformative use of information technology, particularly in supply-chain management, is identified as a major reason for its impact on productivity per man hour.[461][462][463] For every dollar spent by Walmart to improve its own technology, an estimated ten dollars has been invested by suppliers throughout its supply chain on their own systems and software. Economist Robert Solow has emphasized the importance of imitation and adaptation, as well as innovation. In addition to improving its own efficiency, Walmart's innovations have been adopted by its competitors so that they can compete.[461]\n\n\n\n## Labor relations[edit]\n\n\nWorkers speak during Occupy Wall Street\nWith over 2.3 million employees worldwide, Walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce. These issues involve low wages, poor working conditions, inadequate health care, and issues involving the company's strong anti-union policies. In November 2013, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) announced that it had found that in 13 U.S. states, Wal-Mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday, and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes.[464] Critics point to Walmart's high turnover rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce, although other factors may be involved. Approximately 70 percent of its employees leave within the first year.[465] Despite this turnover rate, the company is still able to affect unemployment rates. This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states, \"Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present, but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio-economic variables were taken into account.\"[466]\n\n\nWalmart is the largest private employer in the United States, with 1.6 million employees as of 2020.[35] Walmart employs almost five times as many people as IBM, the second-largest employer.[467] Walmart employs more African Americans than any other private employer in the United States.[468]\nWhile 4.6% of all retail workers, and 16.5% of all US grocery workers, were unionized as of 2020, Walmart does not employ unionized labor and actively discourages unionization and collective bargaining.[35][469][470]\n\n\nWalmart rebranded their Associate Education Benefits to Live Better U in March 2019. Live Better U supports associate education at every level and includes $1 a day college program, cost-free high school education, and discounts on higher education programs through partnership with Guild Education.\n\n\nIn April 2019, Walmart Inc. announced plans to extend the use of robots in stores in order to improve and monitor inventory, clean floors and unload trucks, part of the company's effort to lower its labor costs.[471]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Walmart Inc. announced the expansion of education benefits to recruit high school students. The incentives include flexible work schedules, free SAT and ACT preparation courses, up to seven hours of free college credit, and a debt-free college degree in three fields from six nonprofit universities.[472]\n\n\n\n### Gender[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, a gender discrimination lawsuit, *Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.*, was filed against Walmart, alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions. A class action suit was sought, which would have been the nation's largest in history, covering 1.5 million past and current employees.[473] On June 20, 2011, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Wal-Mart's favor, stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class.[474] The court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs' circumstances, the class action could not proceed as presented, and furthermore, in a 5–4 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit.[475] Several plaintiffs, including the lead plaintiff, Betty Dukes, expressed their intent to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately.[476] Dukes died in 2017.[477] In 2020, Walmart agreed to pay $20 million, stop using a pre-employment test, and furnish other relief to settle a companywide, sex-based hiring discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).[478]\n\n\nAccording to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit, in 2001, Wal-Mart's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filings showed that female employees made up 65 percent of Wal-Mart's hourly paid workforce, but only 33 percent of its management.[479][480] Just 35 percent of its store managers were women, compared to 57 percent at similar retailers.[480] Wal-Mart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair, because it classifies employees differently; if department managers were included in the totals, women would make up 60 percent of the managerial ranks.[480]\n\n\n\n### Sexual orientation and gender identity[edit]\n\n\nIn the Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) 2002 Corporate Equality Index, a measure of how companies treat LGBT employees and customers, gave Wal-Mart Stores Inc. a score of 14%.[481] By 2017, however, HRC's 2017 Corporate Equality Index gave Wal-Mart Stores Inc. a score of a 100%.[482] In 2003, Walmart added sexual orientation to their anti-discrimination policy.[483] In 2005, Walmart's definition of family began including same-sex partners.[484][485][486] In 2006, Walmart announced that \"diversity efforts include new groups of minority, female and gay employees that meet at Walmart headquarters in Bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion. There are seven business resource groups: women, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, gays and lesbians, and a disabled group.\"[487] From 2006 to 2008, Walmart was a member of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.[488] In 2011, Walmart added gender identity to their anti-discrimination policy.[489] Walmart's anti-discrimination policies allow associates to use restroom facilities that corresponds with their gender identity and gender expression.[490] In 2013, Walmart began offering health insurance benefits to domestic partners.[488] In 2015, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, issued a statement opposing House Bill 1228 and asked Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill.[491] In 2016, Walmart began offering full healthcare benefits to its transgender employees.[492]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Walmart\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**.

They have protested against the company's policies and business practices, including charges of racial and gender discrimination.[493][494][495] Other areas of criticism include the company's foreign product sourcing, treatment of suppliers, employee compensation and working conditions, environmental practices, the use of public subsidies, the company's security policies, and slavery.[496][497] Walmart denies doing anything wrong and maintains that low prices are the result of efficiency.[498][499][500]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Walmart announced that it plans to eliminate eggs from battery cages from its supply chain by 2025.[501] The decision was particularly important because of Walmart's large market share and influence on the rest of the industry.[502][503] The move was praised by major animal welfare groups[504] but a poultry trade group representative expressed skepticism about the decision's impact.[504] Walmart's cage-free eggs will not come from free range producers, but rather industrial-scale farms where the birds will be allotted between 1 and 1.5 square feet each, a stressful arrangement which can cause cannibalism.[502][504] Unlike battery cages, the systems of Walmart's suppliers allow the hens to move around, but relative to battery cages they have higher hen mortality rates and present distinct environmental and worker health problems.[505]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Walmart was sued by former Director of Business Development Tri Huynh for claims of reporting misleading e-commerce performance results in favor of the company. Huynh stated the company's move was an attempt to regain lost ground to competitor Amazon.[506]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Walmart was sued by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that Walmart denied requests from pregnant employees to limit heavy lifting.[507]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the Center for Inquiry filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia alleging consumer fraud and the endangering of its customers' health due to Walmart's practice of \"selling homeopathic [products] alongside real medicine, in the same sections in its stores, under the same signs\", according to Nicholas Little, CFI's vice president and general counsel.[508][509] On May 20, 2020, District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Florence Pan dismissed CFI's lawsuit, claiming that CFI had no standing as a consumer protection organization and failed to identify the specific actions on the part of Walmart that led to harm to consumers. CFI has challenged both of those arguments and is planning an appeal.[510]\n\n\nIn July 2019, the Walmart subreddit was flooded with pro-union memes in a protest to the firing of an employee who posted confidential material to the subreddit.[511][512] Many of these posts were angry with Walmart surveying its staff on the Internet. The posting of the union content is in response to the aforementioned alleged anti-union position Walmart has taken in the past.[513]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a federal jury found that Walmart, along with Walgreens and CVS, \"had substantially contributed to\" the opioid crisis.[514] The damages between the three chains in this suit totalled $650 million. Damages claimed by the lawyers for Lake County and Trumbull County in Ohio were $3.3 billion. Two other chains, Rite Aid and Giant Eagle, settled with these counties for undisclosed sums before going to trial.[515]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Walmart, alleging that the company facilitated money transfer fraud. The FTC claimed that Walmart allowed its money transfer services to be used by scammers who stole hundreds of millions of dollars from customers.[516][517]\n\n\n\n### Crime problems[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an August 2016 report by *Bloomberg Businessweek*, aggressive cost-cutting decisions that began in 2000 when Lee Scott took over as CEO of the company led to a significant increase in crime in stores across the United States. These included the removal of the store's famed greeters, who are in part seen as a theft deterrent at exits, the replacement of many cashiers with self-checkout stations, and the addition of stores at a rate that exceeded the hiring of new employees, which led to a 19% increase in space per employee from a decade previous. While these decisions succeeded in increasing profits 23% in the decade that followed, they also led to an increase in both theft and violent crime.[518][449]\n\n\nIn 2015, under CEO Doug McMillon, Walmart began a company-wide campaign to reduce crime that included spot-checking receipts at exits, stationing employees at self-checkout areas, eye-level security cameras in high-theft areas, use of data analytics to detect credit fraud, hiring off-duty police and private security officers, and reducing calls to police with a program by which first-time offenders caught stealing merchandise below a certain value can avoid arrest if they agree to go through a theft-prevention program.[518]\n\n\nLaw enforcement agencies across the United States have noted a burden on resources created by a disproportionate number of calls from Walmart. Experts have criticized the retailer for shifting its security burden onto the taxpayers.[449] Across three Florida counties, approximately 9,000 police calls were logged to 53 Walmart stores but resulted in only a few hundred arrests.[519] In Granite Falls, North Carolina, 92% of larceny calls to local police were from the Walmart store there.[520] The trend is similar in rural, suburban, and urban areas. Police are called to Walmart stores 3 to 4 times as much as similar retailers such as Target.[521] Experts say the chain and its razor-thin profit margins rely heavily on police to protect its bottom line. Walmart Supercenters top the list of those most visited by police.[519]\n\n\nThe police captain in Port Richey, Florida, said that Target stores more often have uniformed security, as well as more visible staff in any case. Another comparison might be shopping malls which often have security patrols and off-duty police officers. J.R. Roberts, a former director for risk management at Valor Security Services (which provides mall security) says: \"Shopping centers all have security; they know it's an expense, but one they know pays dividends because people feel safer going to their stores.\"[518]\n\n\nIn addition to hundreds of thousands of petty crimes, more than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings, stabbings, shootings, and murders occurred at the 4,500 Walmarts in the U.S. in 2016.[518] In 2019, 23 people were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas.[418][420]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2020, a shooting occurred at a Walmart distribution center in Red Bluff, California, United States. One employee was killed, four other employees were wounded, and the shooter was killed by officers.[522][523][524][525]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Walmart decided to take service dog paraphernalia out of stores and online, following an online petition to have them stop selling service dog vests.[526]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* \"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\" – a 2004 episode of Comedy Central's *South Park*\n* A Walmart Supercenter appeared in the 2021 film *Ghostbusters: Afterlife*, at a fictional Oklahoma town, Summerville. It was filmed in a Walmart store (Store #3013) on location in Deerfoot City shopping center at Calgary, Alberta.[527]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Business and economics portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Big-box store\n* Lukas Walton\n* Walmart greeter\n* Wal-Mart First Tee Open at Pebble Beach – former name of a golf tournament\n* *Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price* – a 2005 documentary film by director Robert Greenwald\n* Walmarting – a neologism\n* *Why Wal-Mart Works; and Why That Drives Some People C-R-A-Z-Y* – a 2005 rebuttal to the Greenwald documentary\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The logo's spark symbol has been in use since September 2007.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Our History\". *Corporate.Walmart.com*.

It has been often referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[5] and is often regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is considered to be one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Apple, Meta and Microsoft.\n\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker *The Everything Store*.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\n\n\nAmazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and \"aggressive\" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023[update], it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]\n\n\nAmazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio which acquired in March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\n\n\nAmazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices,[19] a toxic work culture,[20] tax avoidance,[21][22] and anti-competitive behavior.[23][24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Amazon\n\n### 1994–2009: early years[edit]\n\n\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]\n\n\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys..[26][27]\n\n\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the *Fulfillment by Amazon* program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2010–present: growth[edit]\n\n\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34] It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally.[35]\n\n\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada.[36] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.[37][38] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[39] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[40]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[41][42] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[43]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon products and services\n\n### Amazon.com [edit]\n\n\n\n\namazon.com| ![](image)Logo since January 2000\n |\n| Screenshot\n![](image)Homepage\n |\n| Type of site\n | E-commerce |\n| Available in | * Arabic\n* Chinese\n* Dutch\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Hindi\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Polish\n* Portuguese\n* Spanish\n* Swedish\n* Turkish\n |\n| Owner | Amazon |\n| URL | amazon.com (original US site) |\n| Commercial | Yes |\n| Registration | Optional |\n| Launched | 1995; 29 years ago (1995) |\n| Current status | Active |\n| Written in | C++ and Java |\n| [44] |\n\n\nAmazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[45] and consulting services.[46] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.fr for France), though some offer international shipping.[47]\n\n\nVisits to *amazon.com* grew from 615 million annual visitors in 2008,[48] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[49] The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[50]\n\n\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[51] The company's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n| Region | Country | Domain name | Since | Languages\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa\n | Egypt | amazon.eg | September 2021 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com Egypt\n |\n| Americas\n | Brazil | amazon.com.br | December 2012 | Portuguese\n |  |\n| Canada | amazon.ca | June 2002 | English, French\n |  |\n| Mexico | amazon.com.mx | August 2013 | Spanish\n |  |\n| United States | amazon.com | July 1995 | English, Spanish, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)\n | International customers without a localized Amazon website may purchase eBooks from the Kindle Store on Amazon US.[52] |\n| Asia\n | China | amazon.cn | September 2004 | Chinese (Simplified)\n | Formerly known as Joyo.com CHN\n |\n| India | amazon.in | June 2013 | English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi\n |  |\n| Japan | amazon.co.jp | November 2000 | Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified)\n |  |\n| Saudi Arabia | amazon.sa | June 2020 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com KSA\n |\n| Singapore | amazon.sg | July 2017 | English\n |  |\n| Turkey | amazon.com.tr | September 2018 | Turkish\n |  |\n| United Arab Emirates | amazon.ae | May 2019 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com UAE\n |\n| Europe\n | Belgium | amazon.com.be | October 2022 | Dutch, French, English\n |  |\n| France | amazon.fr | August 2000 | French\n |  |\n| Germany | amazon.de | October 1998 | German, English, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Turkish\n | Also serves Austria,[53] Denmark[54] and Switzerland[55] |\n| Italy | amazon.it | November 2010 | Italian\n |  |\n| Netherlands | amazon.nl | November 2014 | Dutch, English\n | Initially only books & e-books, full shop opened March 2020[56] |\n| Poland | amazon.pl | March 2021 | Polish\n |  |\n| Spain | amazon.es | September 2011 | Spanish, Portuguese\n | Also serves Portugal[57] |\n| Sweden | amazon.se | October 2020 | Swedish, English\n |  |\n| United Kingdom | amazon.co.uk | October 1998 | English\n | Also serves Ireland[58] |\n| Oceania | Australia | amazon.com.au | November 2017 | English\n | Also serves New Zealand[59] |\n\n\n#### Merchant partnerships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[60][61][62]\n\n\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[63] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[64]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including *Superman*, *Batman*, *Green Lantern*, *The Sandman*, and *Watchmen*. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[65]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[66]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[67][68] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[68][69] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[70]\n\n\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$ 104.44 million (₹759  crore) in financial year 2017–2018.[71]\n\n\nAs of October 11, 2017[update], AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[72]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[73][74]\n\n\n\n#### Private-label products[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon brands\n\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[75] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Third-party sellers[edit]\n\n\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[77] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Affiliate program[edit]\n\n\nPublishers can signup as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[79] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[80] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[81]\n\n\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Product reviews[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Amazon § Amazon reviews\n\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... *the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used*.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[83]\n\n\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[84]\n\n\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[85] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\n\n\n#### Amazon sales rank[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[86] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[86] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[87] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[88] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[89] though Amazon states:\n\n\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\n> \n> — Amazon.com Help[90]\n> \n\n\n### Physical stores[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[91] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[92] media speculation suggests that Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[91]\n\n\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.[93]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA, as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[94]\n\n\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the US and the United Kingdom.[95]\n\n\n\n### Hardware and services[edit]\n\n\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of eink e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\n\n\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[96]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows US Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[97]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Amazon\n\nAmazon owns over 100 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Amazon Web Services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon Web Services\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Goodreads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Goodreads\n\nGoodreads is a \"social cataloging\" website founded in December 2006 and launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, a software engineer, and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Khuri. The website allows individuals to freely search Goodreads' extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their groups of book suggestions and discussions. In December 2007, the site had over 650,000 members, and over a million books had been added. Amazon bought the company in March 2013.[102]\n\n\n\n#### Ring[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ring (company)\n\nRing is a home automation company founded by Jamie Siminoff in 2013.

In 1984, Brilliance Audio invented a technique for recording twice as much on the same cassette.[121] The technique involved recording on each of the two channels of each stereo track.[121] It has been credited with revolutionizing the burgeoning audiobook market in the mid-1980s since it made unabridged books affordable.[121]\n* **ComiXology**, a cloud-based digital comics platform with over 200 million comic downloads as of September 2013[update].

Amazon bought the company in August 2008.[102] Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016, when Amazon announced that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari.[136][137]\n* **Souq**, the former largest e-commerce platform in the Arab world. The company launched in 2005 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and served multiple areas across the Middle East.[138] On March 28, 2017, Amazon acquired Souq.com for $580 million.[139] The company was re-branded as Amazon and its infrastructure was used to expand Amazon's online platform in the Middle East.[140]\n\n\nAmazon also has investments in renewable energy and plans to expand its position into the Canadian market through an investment in a new plant in Alberta.[141]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Amazon locations\n\n### Logistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon Transportation Services truck at an Amazon Logistics delivery station\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:\n\n\n\n* Amazon Air, a cargo airline for bulk transport, with last-mile delivery handled either by Amazon Flex, Amazon Logistics, or the US Postal Service.\n\n\n![](image)Amazon delivery station in La Crosse by the La Crosse airport\n* Amazon Flex, a smartphone app that enables individuals to act as independent contractors, delivering packages to customers from personal vehicles without uniforms. Deliveries include one or two hours Prime Now, same or next day Amazon Fresh groceries, and standard Amazon.com orders, in addition to orders from local stores that contract with Amazon.[142]\n* Amazon Logistics, in which Amazon contracts with small businesses (which it calls \"Delivery Service Partners\") to perform deliveries to customers. Each business has a fleet of approximately 20–40 Amazon-branded vans, and employees of the contractors wear Amazon uniforms. As of December 2020, it operates in the United States, Canada, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.[143]\n* Amazon Prime Air is an experimental drone delivery service that delivers packages via drones to Amazon Prime subscribers in select cities.\n\n\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[144]\n\n\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the US Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[145] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[146]\n\n\n\n### Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[147][148] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.[149]\n\n\nIn September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.[33]\n\n\n\n* ![Amazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France](image)\n\nAmazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France\n* ![Amazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain](image)\n\nAmazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain\n* ![Amazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK](image)\n\nAmazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK\n* ![Amazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany](image)\n\nAmazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany\n* ![Amazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan](image)\n\nAmazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan\n* ![Amazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US](image)\n\nAmazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2016\nAs of June 2022[update], Amazon's board of directors were:[150]\n\n\n\n* Jeff Bezos, executive chairman, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Andy Jassy, president and CEO, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Keith B. Alexander, CEO of IronNet Cybersecurity, former NSA director\n* Edith W.

Weeks, chairman, president and CEO, Corning Inc.\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAmazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.[151] As of 2018[update], Amazon.com is ranked eighth on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[152]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2021, Amazon reported earnings of US$33.36 billion, with an annual revenue of US$469.82 billion, an increase of 21.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835 billion to 469.822 billion, due to continued business expansion.[153]\n\n\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1 trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[154]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue[155]in mil.

He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[174] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[175] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[176]\n\n\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[177]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[178] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[179] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[180]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\n\n![](image)A sticker expressing an anti-Amazon message is pictured on the back of a street sign in Seattle.Amazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[181] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[182] leading customers away from bookshops;[183] adversely impacting the environment;[184] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[185] actively opposing unionization efforts;[186] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[23][24] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[187][188] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[189] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[190][191]\n\n\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[192] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[193] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[194]\n\n\nJane Friedman[195] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon and Goodreads resisted removing the fraudulent titles until the author's complaints went viral on social media, in a blog post titled \"I Would Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This (Or: Why Goodreads and Amazon Are Becoming Dumpster Fires).\"[196][197][198][199]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award\n* Amazon Pay\n* Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\n* Camelcamelcamel – a website that tracks the prices of products sold on Amazon.com\n* History of Amazon\n* Internal carbon pricing\n* List of book distributors\n* Statistically improbable phrases – Amazon.com's phrase extraction technique for indexing books\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Amazon.com, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K Annual Report\".

Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products. ExxonMobil is headquartered near the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in the U.S. state of New Jersey.[7][8]: 1\n\n\nExxonMobil's history traces its earliest roots to 1866 with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879. The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the **Standard Oil Company of New Jersey** (or **Jersey Standard** for short), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup. Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony). Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil. The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.[9]\n\n\nExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. ExxonMobil since its merger varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company.[10][11] As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the *Fortune* 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the *Fortune* Global 500.[12] ExxonMobil is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value.[13][14] ExxonMobil's reserves were 20 billion BOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years.[15] With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec.[16][17] Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation (4.83%).\n\n\nExxonMobil has been widely criticized, mostly for environmental incidents and its history of climate change denial against the scientific consensus that fossil fuels significantly contribute to global warming. The company is responsible for many oil spills, the largest and most notable of which was the *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in Alaska and itself considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment.[18][19] The company has also been the target of accusations of human rights violations, excessive influence on America's foreign policy, and its impact on various societies across the world.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of ExxonMobil\n\nExxonMobil traces its roots to Vacuum Oil Company, founded in 1866. Vacuum Oil later was acquired by Standard Oil in 1879, divested from Standard in 1911 with its breakup, and merged by the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), later known as Mobil, in 1931. After the 1911 breakup, Standard Oil continued to exist through its New Jersey subsidiary, sometimes shortened to Jersey Standard, and retained the Standard Oil name in much of the eastern United States. Jersey Standard grew by acquiring Humble Oil in the 1930s and became the dominant oil company on the world stage. The company's lack of ownership over the Standard Oil name across the United States, however, prompted a name change to unify all of its brands under one name, choosing to name itself Exxon in 1972 over continuing to use three distinct brands of Esso, Enco, and Humble.[21][9]\n\n\nIn 1998, the two companies agreed to merge and form ExxonMobil, with the deal closing on November 30, 1999. The two companies cited lower oil prices and a better ability to compete with other state-owned oil companies outside of the United States like Pemex and Aramco. With the deal, the two companies practically merged, with the new company's name containing both of the trade names of its immediate predecessors. However, the structure of the merger provided that Exxon was the surviving company and bought Mobil, rather than a new company being created.[9][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil is the largest non-government-owned company in the energy industry and produces about 3% of the world's oil and about 2% of the world's energy.[25]\n\n\nExxonMobil is vertically integrated into a number of global operating divisions. These divisions are grouped into three categories for reference purposes, though the company also has several standalone divisions, such as Coal & Minerals. It also owns hundreds of smaller subsidiaries such as XTO Energy and SeaRiver Maritime. ExxonMobil also has a majority ownership stake in Imperial Oil.[26]\n\n\n\n* Upstream (oil exploration, extraction, shipping, and wholesale operations)\n* Product Solutions (downstream, chemical)\n* Low Carbon Solutions [27]\n\n\n### Upstream[edit]\n\n\nThe upstream division makes up the majority of ExxonMobil's revenue, accounting for approximately 70% of it.[28] In 2021, ExxonMobil had about 30 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents, as well as 38.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas.[29]\n\n\nIn the United States, ExxonMobil's petroleum exploration and production activities are concentrated in the Permian Basin, Bakken Formation, Woodford Shale, Caney Shale, and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, ExxonMobil has several gas developments in the regions of Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, Haynesville Shale, Barnett Shale, and Fayetteville Shale. All natural gas activities are conducted by its subsidiary, XTO Energy. As of December 31, 2014, ExxonMobil owned 14.6 million acres (59,000 km2) in the United States, of which 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2) were offshore, 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2) of which were in the Gulf of Mexico.[30] In California, it has a joint venture called Aera Energy LLC with Shell Oil. In Canada, the company holds 5.4 million acres (22,000 km2), including 1 million acres (4,000 km2) offshore and 0.7 million acres (2,800 km2) of the Kearl Oil Sands Project.[30]\n\n\nIn Argentina, ExxonMobil holds 0.9 million acres (3,600 km2) and 4.9 million acres (20,000 km2) in Germany. In the Netherlands ExxonMobil owns 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2), in Norway it owns 0.4 million acres (1,600 km2) offshore, and the United Kingdom 0.6 million acres (2,400 km2) offshore. In Africa, upstream operations are concentrated in Angola, where it owns 0.4 million acres (1,600 km2) offshore, Chad where it owns 46,000 acres (19,000 ha), Equatorial Guinea, where it owns 0.1 million acres (400 km2) offshore, and Nigeria, where it owns 0.8 million acres (3,200 km2) offshore.[30] In addition, ExxonMobil plans to start exploration activities off the coast of Liberia and the Ivory Coast.[31][32] In the past, ExxonMobil had exploration activities in Madagascar, however these operations were ended due to unsatisfactory results.[33]\n\n\nIn Asia, it holds 9,000 acres (3,600 ha) in Azerbaijan, 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2) in Indonesia, of which 1.3 million acres (5,300 km2) are offshore, 0.7 million acres (2,800 km2) in Iraq, 0.3 million acres (1,200 km2) in Kazakhstan, 0.2 million acres (810 km2) in Malaysia, 65,000 acres (26,000 ha) in Qatar, 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) in Yemen, 21,000 acres (8,500 ha) in Thailand, and 81,000 acres (33,000 ha) in the United Arab Emirates.[30]\n\n\nUntil the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, ExxonMobil held 85,000 acres (34,000 ha) in the Sakhalin-I project through its subsidiary Exxon Neftegas. Together with Rosneft, it has developed 63.6 million acres (257,000 km2) in Russia, including the East-Prinovozemelsky field. In Australia, ExxonMobil held 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2), including 1.6 million acres (6,500 km2) offshore. It also operates the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, and participates in the development of Gorgon LNG project. In Papua New Guinea, it holds 1.1 million acres (4,500 km2), including the PNG Gas project.[30] After Russia's 2022 invasion began, though, ExxonMobil announced it was fully pulling out of both Russia and Sakhalin-I, and launched a lawsuit against Russia's federal government on August 30.[34]\n\n\n\n### Product Solutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An ExxonMobil gas station in Hiawassee, Georgia\nExxonMobil formed its Product Solutions division in 2022, combining its previously separate Downstream and Chemical divisions into a single company.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Downstream and Retail[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil markets products around the world under the brands of Exxon, Mobil, and Esso. Mobil is ExxonMobil's primary retail gasoline brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes, and the Midwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas (shared with Mobil), and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. ExxonMobil has stations in 46 states, just behind Shell USA and ahead of Phillips 66, lacking a presence only in Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, and Kansas.[36]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, Esso and Mobil are primarily used, with Esso operating in 14 countries and Mobil operating in 29 countries and regions.[37]\n\n\nIn Japan, ExxonMobil had a 22% stake in TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K., a refining company that merged into Eneos in 2017.[38][39]\n\n\nExxonMobil's primary retail brands worldwide are Exxon, Esso, Mobil, with the former being used exclusively in the United States and the latter two being used in most other countries where ExxonMobil operates. Esso is the only one of its brands not used widely in the United States. Since 2008, Mobil is the only brand for the company lubricants. Since 2018, ExxonMobil has operated a loyalty program, ExxonMobil Rewards+, where customers earn rewards points when filling up at its stations in the United States and later the United Kingdom.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n#### Chemicals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nExxonMobil Chemical is a petrochemical company that was created by merging Exxon's and Mobil's chemical industries in 1999. Its principal products include basic olefins and aromatics, ethylene glycol, polyethylene, and polypropylene along with speciality lines such as elastomers, plasticizers, solvents, process fluids, oxo alcohols and adhesive resins. The company also produces synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives, propylene packaging films and catalysts. ExxonMobil is the largest producer of butyl rubber.[43] Infineum, a joint venture with Shell plc, is manufacturing and marketing crankcase lubricant additives, fuel additives, and specialty lubricant additives, as well as automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, and industrial oils.[44]\n\n\n\n#### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mobil 1\n\nMobil 1, a brand of synthetic motor oil, is a major sponsor of multiple racing teams and as the official motor oil of NASCAR since 2003.[45] ExxonMobil is currently in partnerships with Oracle Red Bull Racing in Formula One and Kalitta Motorsports.[46][47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Refineries[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil operates 21 refineries worldwide, and the company claims 80% of its refining capacity is integrated with chemical or lube basestocks. ExxonMobil's largest refinery in the United States is its Baytown Refinery, located in Baytown, Texas, and its largest refinery overall is its Jurong Island facility in Singapore; these two refineries combined output over 1.15 million barrels of oil per day. In 2021, ExxonMobil's global average refining capacity was 4.6 million barrels per day, with the United States producing a plurality of the company's refining capacity at about 1.77 million barrels per day. ExxonMobil's corporate website claims it refines almost 5 million barrels per day.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\nExxonMobil was one of few U.S. refiners to expand capacity by a significant margin following an industry downturn suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.[53] The company completed a 250,000 barrels per day expansion at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery in early 2023.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Low Carbon Solutions[edit]\n\n\nOfficially formed with ExxonMobil's 2022 corporate restructuring, and currently led by former General Motors president Dan Ammann, Low Carbon Solutions is the company's alternative energy division. The division intends to lower emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry, commercial transportation, and power generation using a combination of lower-emission fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Low Carbon Solutions conducts research on clean energy technologies, including algae biofuels, biodiesel made from agricultural waste, carbonate fuel cells, and refining crude oil into plastic by using a membrane and osmosis instead of heat.[55][56] The company speculated in April 2023 that pending good economic conditions, the low-carbon solutions business could eclipse the value of its oil and gas operations.[57]\n\n\nThe company is in the process of designing its inaugural large-scale plant dedicated to producing low-carbon hydrogen, situated within its refining and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas. This project is set to become the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen project.[58][59]\n\n\n\n#### Carbon capture and storage[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil publicly announced it would be investing $15 billion in what it deemed a \"lower carbon future\", and claims to be the world leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS). The company additionally plans that its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions will be carbon neutral by 2050. ExxonMobil additionally acquired biofuel company Biojet AS in 2022, and its Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil is moving ahead with plans to produce a renewable diesel biofuel.[60][61] In July 2023, Exxon agreed to acquire Denbury Resources for $4.9 billion to further its low-carbon efforts.[62]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nBig Oil companies[b]\n| Company\n | Revenue (USD)[63] | Profit (USD)\n | Brands\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ExxonMobil | $286 billion\n | $23 billion\n | MobilEssoImperial Oil |\n| Shell plc | $273 billion\n | $20 billion\n | Jiffy LubePennzoil |\n| TotalEnergies | $185 billion\n | $16 billion\n | Elf AquitaineSunPower |\n| BP | $164 billion\n | $7.6 billion\n | AmocoAral AG |\n| Chevron | $163 billion\n | $16 billion\n | TexacoCaltexHavoline |\n| Marathon | $141 billion\n | $10 billion\n | ARCO[64] |\n| Phillips 66 | $115 billion\n | $1.3 billion\n | 76ConocoJET |\n| Valero | $108 billion\n | $0.9 billion\n | —\n |\n| Eni | $77 billion\n | $5.8 billion\n | —\n |\n| ConocoPhillips | $48.3 billion\n | $8.1 billion\n | —\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Financial data[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Fortune* Global 500, ExxonMobil was the second largest company, second largest publicly held corporation, and the largest oil company in the United States by 2017 revenue.[65] For the fiscal year 2020, ExxonMobil reported a loss of US$22.4 billion, with an annual revenue of US$181.5 billion, a decline of 31.5% over the previous fiscal cycle.[66]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mln.

Former ExxonMobil offices in Downtown Houston were vacated in early 2015.\nExxonMobil's headquarters are located in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston.[78][79]\n\n\nThe company decided to consolidate its Houston operations into one new campus located in northern Harris County and vacate its offices on 800 Bell St. which it had occupied since 1963.[80] The new operation complex includes twenty office buildings totaling 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m2), a wellness center, laboratory, and three parking garages.[81] It is designed to house nearly 10,000 employees.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe current chairman of the board and CEO of ExxonMobil Corp. is Darren W. Woods. Woods was elected chairman of the board and CEO effective January 1, 2017, after the retirement of former chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson. Before his election as chairman and CEO, Woods was elected president of ExxonMobil and a member of the board of directors in 2016.[82]\n\n\nAs of July 28, 2021[update], the current ExxonMobil board members are:[83]\n\n\n\n* Michael J.

As of 2020, ExxonMobil has been responsible for more than 3,000 oil spills and leakages which resulted in a loss of more than one barrel of oil, with the most in a single year being 484 spills in 2011.[97] Additionally, since 1965, ExxonMobil has released more than 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution.[98]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Science* journal published a paper reporting that the global warming projections and models created by ExxonMobil's own scientists between 1977 and 2003 had \"accurately\" projected and \"skillfully\" modeled global warming due to fossil fuel burning, and had reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. The authors of the paper concluded: \"Yet, whereas academic and government scientists worked to communicate what they knew to the public, ExxonMobil worked to deny it.\"[99][100]\n\n\nBetween the 1980s and 2014, ExxonMobil was a notable denier of climate change, though the company officially changed its position in 2014 to acknowledge the existence of climate change. ExxonMobil's prolonged response incited the creation of the *Exxon Knew* movement, which aims to hold the company accountable for various climate-related incidents. ExxonMobil has used its own website to attack *Exxon Knew*, claiming that it is a coordinated effort to defame the company.[101][102][103][104]\n\n\nIn December 2022, U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney and U.S. House Oversight Environment Subcommittee Chair Ro Khanna sent a memorandum to all House Oversight and Reform Committee members summarizing additional findings from the committee's investigation into the fossil fuel industry disinformation campaign to obscure the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming. Upon reviewing internal company documents, they accused ExxonMobil along with BP, Chevron, and Shell of greenwashing their Paris Agreement carbon neutrality pledges while continuing long-term investment in fossil fuel production and sales, for engaging in a campaign to promote the use of natural gas as a clean energy source and bridge fuel to renewable energy, and of intimidating journalists reporting about the companies' climate actions and of obstructing the committee's investigation, which ExxonMobil, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute denied.[105][106][107]\n\n\n\n### Oil spills and plastic pollution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup\nExxonMobil's operations have been subject to numerous oil spills both before and after the 1999 merger. The most widely publicized oil spill was the 1989 *Valdez* oil spill, where an Exxon tanker discharged approximately 11 million U.S. gallons (42,000 m3) of oil into Prince William Sound,[108] oiling 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of the remote Alaskan coastline. The spill remains the second largest in American history, only trailing BP's *Deepwater Horizon* spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[109]\n\n\nExxonMobil was also responsible for various other oil spills across the world. Some of Exxon's largest and most notable oil spills in the United States include long-lasting oil leaks totaling into an estimated 30 million gallon spill into New York City's Newtown Creek over the course of a century by Exxon and other Standard Oil predecessors,[110] a 2011 oil spill which leaked 1,500 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River (resulting in about $135 million in damages),[111] and a 2012 1,900 barrel (80,000 gallon) spill from the company's Baton Rouge Refinery in the rivers of Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana.[112] ExxonMobil's actives in Louisiana in particular, especially its Baton Rouge Refinery, have given the area the nickname of *Cancer Alley*. The company's activities, along with other operations and refineries in the area, have been the source of increased cancer infections, lower air quality, and as seen by some, potential environmental racism committed by the company.[113][114]\n\n\nIn May 2021, ExxonMobil topped the Plastic Waste Makers Index report published by the Minderoo Foundation of 20 petrochemical companies that manufactured 55 percent of the single-use plastic waste in the world in 2019 (which were part of a larger group of 100 petrochemical companies that manufactured 90 percent of the waste),[115][116] while in April 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a subpoena to ExxonMobil for information related to the company's role in overstating the effectiveness of plastic recycling in reducing plastic pollution as part of an industry campaign to promote plastic usage.[117][118][119]\n\n\n\n### Geopolitical influence and human rights violations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Conflict in the Niger Delta\n\n![](image)Former CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, May 2017\nExxonMobil has also been accused of human rights violations and abusing its geopolitical influence.[20] In the book *Private Empire* by Steve Coll, ExxonMobil is described as extremely powerful \"corporate state within the American state\" in dealing with the countries in which it drills, going to the point as describing such countries' governments as \"constrained\".[120] The company's corporate ancestors are also blamed for the outbreak of the 1954 Jebel Akhdar War, which was sparked by the Iraq Petroleum Company's activities.[121][122]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Aceh\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, ExxonMobil (through predecessor Mobil) hired military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide security for their gas extraction and liquefaction project in Aceh, Indonesia, and these military units were accused of committing human rights violations. ExxonMobil eventually pulled out from Indonesia completely in 2001, while denying any wrongdoing.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 2022 surge in profits among ExxonMobil and other large oil companies, partly due to the war in Ukraine,[124][125] U.S. President Joe Biden criticized ExxonMobil. In June 2022, amid record oil prices, he said that \"Exxon made more money than God this year\".[126] When the oil giant reported its second quarter earnings in 2022, CNN reported that Exxon made US$2,245.62 per second in profit across the 92-day long second quarter.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Esso\n* History of ExxonMobil\n* Litigation involving ExxonMobil:\n\t+ *Connecticut v.

As of March 2023[update], Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization,[6] and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue.[7] As of June 2022[update], Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nApple was founded as **Apple Computer Company** on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Apple Inc.\n\n### 1976–1980: Founding and incorporation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\n\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. This unit received an aftermarket keyboard and a wooden case.\n![](image)The Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[9][12] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[14]: 57 Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[17][18]: 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[19]\n\n\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]\n\n\nThe Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[25] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]\n\n\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]\n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022[update]),[21] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 1980–1990: Success with Macintosh[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family\n\n![](image)The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\nA critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[32] shares (22.4 million split-adjusted shares as of September 3, 2022[update])[21] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[33] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[34]\n\n\nThe Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library.[35]\n\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[36] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[37]\n\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[38] Its debut was signified by \"1984\", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[39] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[40] and was called a \"masterpiece\" by CNN[41] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by *TV Guide*.[42]\n\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[43]: 195 In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[44] saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[45] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[46]\n\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[47] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[47] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[48] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\".[37][49][50] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[49] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[18] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[51]\n\n\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[52] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[53]\n\n\nThis dominant position in the desktop publishing market[54] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[55]: 79–80\n\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles that offered some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[55]: 117–129 During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[56] Gassée left the company later that year.[57]\n\n\n\n### 1990–1997: Decline and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[58] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine *MacAddict* named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[60]\n\n![](image)The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[61]\nThe success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, aimed at different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between so many models.[62]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued, which was expensive to produce, and the company decided was still taking sales away from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers away from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[63] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[64]\n\n\nApple also experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video game consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were invested in the problem-plagued Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[65]\n\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[66] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in *Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*[67] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.\n\n\nThe major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[68]\n\n\nWith Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which used IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[69]\n\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[70]\n\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[71]\n\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach.[72] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that same year, Copland in 1994, and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of the $125 million Apple wanted to pay.[73]\n\n\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy,[74] Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.[75]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2007: Return to profitability[edit]\n\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[76] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\n\n\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[77] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[78] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[79] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[80] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[81]\n\n\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[77]\n\n\n\n![](image)\niMac\n![](image)\niBook\n![](image)\nPower Macintosh G3\n![](image)\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800,000 units in its first five months[82] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[83] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. The device also had a striking teardrop shape and translucent materials, designed by Jonathan Ive, who although hired by Amelio, would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apple's products.[84][85]\n\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers. It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[86]\n\n\nAt around the same time, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[87] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[88] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[88] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs.[89]\n\n\n2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\n\n\nThe first announcement came on March 24, 2001, that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, with Apple aiming to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface, heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[90]\n\n\nIn May 2001, the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California,[91][92] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[93] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[94] but they went on to become highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[95]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[96]\n\n\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered music downloads for 99¢ a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[97] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[98]\n\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[99] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[100] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)The MacBook Pro is Apple's first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[102] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[102] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[103] On April 29, 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]\n\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Success with mobile devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.\nDuring his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called \"a game changer for the industry\".[114]\n\n\nIn an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]\n\n\nIn July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that \"the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well\", and explained that the break would allow the company \"to focus on delivering extraordinary products\".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[122]\n\n\nAfter years of speculation and multiple rumored \"leaks\", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain \"involved in major strategic decisions\".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs' death.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBook's Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography \"Steve Jobs\" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]\n\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a then-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450 million[148] and further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make $280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]\n\n\nIn May 2014, the company confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine's audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the \"Beats by Dr. Dre\" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for $3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always \"belonged\" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's \"unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.\" The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple's history.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nDuring a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch, the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.\n\n\nIn January 2016, it was announced that one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2016, *Fortune* released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with $233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.[156]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Towards the end of the year, *TechCrunch* reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple $400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]\n\n\nAlso in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, as well as a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]\n\n\nDuring the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, 8 and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook's leadership.[164]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of $2 trillion.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)MacBook Air M1 (2020)\nDuring its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple's processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that an effort to develop its own chips left Apple better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the pandemic era and led to increased profitability, with sales of Mac computers that included M1 chips rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Apple Inc. products.\n\n### Mac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac (computer)\n![A MacBook Air, in midnight color, on a wooden desk.](image)\nMacBook Air with M2 chip\n![An thin iMac in blue color on a desk.](image)\niMac with M1 chip\n\nThe Mac is Apple's family of personal computers. Macs are known for their ease of use[179] and distinctive aluminium, minimalist designs. Macs have been popular among students, creative professionals, and software engineers. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops, and the iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro desktop computers.\n\n\nOften described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.\n\n\nApple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.\n\n\n\n### iPhone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPhone\n\n![An iPhone 14 Pro with Chinese user interface, held by a customer, screen facing the camera](image)iPhone 14 Pro\nThe iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released annually. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the iPhone has 15% market share, yet represents 50% of global smartphone revenues, with Android phones accounting for the rest.[180][181] The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[182]\n\n\n\n### iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPad\n\nThe iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[183][184]\n\n\nAs of September 2020,[update] Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[185] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020[update],[186] and accounted for nine percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021[update].[1]\n\n\nApple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAirPods Max\n![](image)\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nApple makes several other products that it categorizes as \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\".[187] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones and HomePod Mini smart speakers.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the company's revenues.[1]\n\n\nAt WWDC 2023, Apple introduced its new VR headset, Vision Pro, along with visionOS.[188] Apple announced that it will be partnering with Unity to bring existing 3D apps to Vision Pro using Unity's PolySpatial technology.[189][190][191][192]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n\n\nAs of the end of 2021[update], services comprise about 19% of the company's revenue.[1] Many of the services have been launched as of 2019[update] when Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[193]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marketing of Apple Inc.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Marketing of Apple Inc..** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[194]\nAccording to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[197]\n\n\nApple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[198] On August 27, 1999,[199] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[200]\n\n\nApple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon,\"[201] while Ive claimed in 2014 that \"people have an incredibly personal relationship\" with Apple's products.[84]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[202] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's \"Best Global Brands\" report.[203] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year as of 2005[update].[204]\n\n\nAs of January 2021,[update] 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[205][206] In February 2023 that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Inc. advertising\n\nApple's first slogan, \"Byte into an Apple\", was coined in the late 1970s.[209] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan \"Think different\" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[210] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, \"iThink, therefore iMac\" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[211] and \"Say hello to iPhone\" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[212] \"Hello\" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (\"hello (again)\"), and iPod.[213]\n\n\nFrom the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[214] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[215] Apple's product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[216] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song \"1234\" and Yael Naïm with the song \"New Soul\".[216]\n\n\n\n### Stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\n![](image)Apple Fifth Avenue is the flagship store in New York City.\n![](image)A Genius Bar is at Apple's Regent Street store in London.\nThe first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[91] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[93] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[93] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[217] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[91] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[94] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[94]\n\n\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017[update].[95] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[218] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[219]\n\n\nMany Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone \"flagship\" stores in high-profile locations.[93] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[220] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[221] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[218] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[218] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[218]\n\n\n\n### Market power[edit]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[222]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game *Fortnite*, sued Apple and Google after its hugely popular video game was removed from Apple and Google's App Store. The suits came after both Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system, effectively shutting out the tech titans from collecting fees.[223] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[224] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps as well as privacy rule changes.[225] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that \"this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners,\" commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[226]\n\n\n\n### Customer privacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)PRISM: a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple[227]\nApple has a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[228] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[229] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[230] It also introduced \"differential privacy\", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that *Wired* described as \"trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it\".[231] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[232]\n\n\nWith Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, titled \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. Despite Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in mid-spring 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[233]\n\n\nHowever, Apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[234] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[235]\n\n\nPrior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[236]\n\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[237]\n\n\nIn December 2019, a report found that the iPhone 11 Pro continues tracking location and collecting user data even after users have disabled location services. In response, an Apple engineer said the Location Services icon \"appears for system services that do not have a switch in settings.\"[238]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[239]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker\n\n### Business trends[edit]\n\n\nThe key trends for Apple are (as of the financial year ending September 24):[240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue figures\n |\n| Total revenue (US$ b)[242] | 108\n | 156\n | 170\n | 182\n | 233\n | 215\n | 229\n | 265\n | 260\n | 274\n | 365\n | 394\n | 383\n |\n| - iPhone revenue (US$ b)\n | 45.9\n | 78.6\n | 91.2\n | 101\n | 155\n | 136\n | 139\n | 164\n | 142\n | 137\n | 191\n | 205\n | 200\n |\n| - Mac revenue (US$ b)\n | 21.7\n | 23.2\n | 21.4\n | 24.0\n | 25.4\n | 22.8\n | 25.5\n | 25.1\n | 25.7\n | 28.6\n | 35.1\n | 40.1\n | 29.3\n |\n| - iPad revenue (US$ b)\n | 19.1\n | 30.9\n | 31.9\n | 30.2\n | 23.2\n | 20.6\n | 18.8\n | 18.3\n | 21.2\n | 23.7\n | 31.8\n | 29.2\n | 28.3\n |\n| - Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue (US$ b)\n | 11.9\n | 10.7\n | 10.1\n | 8.3\n | 10.0\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 17.3\n | 24.4\n | 30.6\n | 38.3\n | 41.2\n | 39.8\n |\n| - Services revenue (US$ b)\n | 9.3\n | 12.8\n | 16.0\n | 18.0\n | 19.9\n | 24.3\n | 32.7\n | 39.7\n | 46.2\n | 53.7\n | 68.4\n | 78.1\n | 85.2\n |\n| Non-revenue figures\n |\n| Net profit (US$ b)[243] | 25.9\n | 41.7\n | 37.0\n | 39.5\n | 53.3\n | 45.6\n | 48.3\n | 59.3\n | 55.2\n | 57.4\n | 94.6\n | 99.8\n | 96.9\n |\n| Number of employees (k, FTE)\n | 60.4\n | 72.8\n | 80.3\n | 92.6\n | 110\n | 116\n | 123\n | 132\n | 137\n | 147\n | 154\n | 164\n | 161\n |\n| References | [244] | [245] | [246] | [247] | [248] | [249] | [250] | [251] | [252] | [253] | [254] | [255] | [256] |\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n#### Senior management[edit]\n\n\nAs of March 16, 2021[update], the management of Apple Inc. includes:[257]\n\n\n\n* Tim Cook (chief executive officer)\n* Jeff Williams (chief operating officer)\n* Luca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\n* Katherine L.

Steve Jobs (1997–2011)\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Co-founder Steve Wozniak and engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in 1985.\n![](image)Universities with the most alumni at Apple\nApple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[262] Steve Capps,[263] Rod Holt,[262] Alan Kay,[264][265] Guy Kawasaki,[264][266] Al Alcorn,[267] Don Norman,[264] Rich Page,[262] Steve Wozniak,[262] and Phil Schiller.[268]\n\n\nAt Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[*needs update*] Jobs saw this as a means of having \"best-in-class\" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[269] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[259][270] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[271] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[272]\n\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[273] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[274]\n\n\nApple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[276]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X \"moonshot factory\".[277]\n\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Apple Park and Apple Campus\n\n![](image)Apple Park is the main headquarters in Cupertino.\nApple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.\nApple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.[278] The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.\n\n\nIn addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[279] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[280]\n\n\nApple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[281] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[282] Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[283]\n\n\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[284] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\n\n\nThe company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado, Culver City, California, Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[285]\n\n\n\n### Litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.\n\nApple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[286] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include *Apple v. Samsung*, *Apple v. Microsoft*, *Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.*, and *Apple Corps v. Apple Computer*. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[287] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[288] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[289] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[290]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\nApple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, the world's largest technology company by total assets,[291] and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[292]\n\n\nIn its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[293] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[294]\n\n\nThe company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[295] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the *Fortune* 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[296] As of 2016[update], Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[297]\n\n\nApple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[298]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2017, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250 billion,[299] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later.[300]\n\n\nAs of August 3, 2018[update], Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value.[301][302] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[303]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[304]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[305]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nApple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to *The New York Times*, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[306][307]\n\n\nBritish Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[308] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[309]\n\n\nAccording to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[310] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. \"Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules\", the report said.[311]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[312]\n\n\nApple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[313] In an interview with the German newspaper *FAZ* in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[314]\n\n\nIn 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted \"illegal state aid\" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the Commission had provided insufficient evidence.[315][316] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following 8 years.[317]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nApple is a partner of (PRODUCT)RED, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[318] generating more than US$20 million,[319] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[320]\n\n\nApple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[321] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[322] as well as for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[323] The company has also used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[324] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[325] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[326] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[327] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[328]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, \"help protect life on our planet.\" Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[329]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating \"millions\" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[330]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million \"Racial Equity and Justice Initiative\" to help combat institutional racism worldwide.[331][332]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental impact of Apple\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Environmental impact of Apple.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Apple Energy[edit]\n\n\nApple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016[update], Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[333] In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[334] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.[335]\n\n\n\n### Energy and resources[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category \"Striding\".[336] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a \"stuck icon\", adding that Apple at the time was \"a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer\".[337]\n\n\nFollowing a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[338][339] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.[340]\n\n\nIn May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, \"Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.\"[341]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.[342] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[343] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,[344] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m3) in 2015.[345]\n\n\nDuring an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016[update], 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[346] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[347]\n\n\nApple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[348] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[349]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[350]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[351]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple's carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[352][353]\n\n\n\n### Toxins[edit]\n\n\nFollowing further campaigns by Greenpeace,[354] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[355] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[356][357][358][359] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[360] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[356][361] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.[356][362]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[363] Greenpeace praised Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[364] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[365]\n\n\n\n### Green bonds[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a $1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[366]\n\n\n\n## Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple supply chain\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple supply chain.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nApple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by *The New York Times*, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that \"Made in the USA\" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[367]\n\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[368][369]\n\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[370] and subsequently invested $200 million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[371] The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told *CNBC* that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology— and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that— that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[372]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Apple uses components from 43 countries.[373] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[374] but also Brazil,[375] and India.[376]\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple's smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[377] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC's total income in 2021.[378] Apple's Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[379] from the A7 bionic onwards, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC as well.[380]\n\n\nDuring the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[381] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[382]\n\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[383] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[384] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[385] In March, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[386] and in May, the *Journal* wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[387] while Apple told *CNBC* that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[388] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[389] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[390]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by *The Wall Street Journal* to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[391]\n\n\n\n### Worker organizations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple and unions\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of, or be better summarized in Apple and unions.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to incorporate it into this article's main text, or the main text of another article. *(January 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[392][393]\n\n\nApple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[394] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008[update].[395] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.[396]\n\n\nThe Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide,[397] resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[397][398][399] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[400] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n\n\n\n\n> [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[401]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[401] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[402]\n\n\nAlso in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[403] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[404] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[405] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[406]\n\n\nA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010[update], Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: \"We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions\".[402]\n\n\nIn December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in \"primitive, dark and filthy dorms\" where they sleep \"on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.\" Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[407]\n\n\nIn 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[408]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apple Inc. media events\n* Pixar\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Apple 10-K Report FY2021\" (PDF).

Offering insurance services under UnitedHealthcare and healthcare products under Optum, it is the world's eleventh-largest company by revenue and the largest healthcare company by revenue, and the largest insurance company by net premiums. Optum and UnitedHealthcare had roughly equal earnings from operations in 2022.\n\n\nThe company is ranked 10th on the 2023 Fortune Global 500. UnitedHealth Group had a market capitalization of $477.4 billion as of August 7, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has origins dating back to late 1974 with the founding of Minnesota-based Charter Med Incorporated by Richard Taylor Burke. It originally processed claims for doctors at the Hennepin County Medical Society.[3] United HealthCare Corporation was founded in 1977 to purchase Charter Med and create a network-based health plan for seniors.[4] It became a publicly traded company in 1984 and changed its name to UnitedHealth Group in 1998.[5]\n\n\nIn 1988, United HealthCare started its first pharmacy benefit management, through its Diversified Pharmaceutical Services subsidiary. It managed pharmacy benefits delivered both through retail pharmacies and mail. The subsidiary was sold to SmithKline Beecham in 1994 for $2.3 billion.[6]\n\n\nIn 1994, United HealthCare acquired Ramsey-HMO, a Florida insurer.[7] In 1995, the company acquired The MetraHealth Companies Inc. for $1.65 billion. MetraHealth was a privately held company formed by combining the group healthcare operations of The Travelers Companies and MetLife. In 1996, United HealthCare acquired HealthWise of America, which operated HMOs in Arkansas, Maryland, Kentucky and Tennessee.[8]\n\n\nIn 1998, the company was reorganized as the holding of independent companies UnitedHealthcare, Ovations, Uniprise, Specialized Care Services and Ingenix, and rebranded as \"UnitedHealth Group\". Also in 1998, United Health Group acquired HealthPartners of Arizona, operator of Arizona's largest AHCCCS provider.[9]\n\n\nIn 2001, EverCare, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, merged with LifeMark Health Plans[10] In 2002, UnitedHealth Group acquired GeoAccess and Medicaid insurance company AmeriChoice.[11] In 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Mid Atlantic Medical Services, an insurer serving Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, Delaware and West Virginia.[12] Also in 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Golden Rule Financial, a provider of health savings accounts.[13] On July 21, 2003, Exante Bank started operating in Salt Lake City, Utah, as a Utah state-chartered industrial loan corporation. It changed its name to OptumHealth Bank in 2008[14] and to Optum Bank in 2012.\n\n\nIn April 2004, UnitedHealth Group acquired Touchpoint Health Plan, a Wisconsin health plan.[15] In July 2004, the company acquired Oxford Health Plans.[16]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the company acquired PacifiCare Health Systems.[17] It agreed to divest parts of PacifiCare's commercial health insurance business in Tucson, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to satisfy antitrust regulator concerns, and also agreed to end its network access agreement with Blue Shield of California. The Tucson business was sold to Cigna.[18] The company acquired Prescription Solutions, another pharmacy benefits manager, as part of its acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems.[19] This business was later rebranded OptumRx.\n\n\nIn February 2006, the company acquired John Deere Health Care.[20][21][22] The same year, William W. McGuire stepped down as chairman and director due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal.[23] He was replaced by CEO Stephen Hemsley who had served as president and COO and a member of the board of directors. McGuire's exit compensation from UnitedHealth was anticipated to be $1.1 billion,[24] but he only received $618 million after returning $420 million in stock options.[25]\n\n\nIn February 2008, the company acquired Sierra Health Services for $2.6 billion.[26] As part of the transaction, to obtain regulatory approval, 25,000 customers were sold to Humana.[27] In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group agreed to acquire Health Net's Northeast licensed subsidiaries for up to $570 million in payments spread out over two years.[28] Through 2010 and into 2011, senior executives of the company met monthly with executives of other health insurers to limit the effect of the health care reform law.[29]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Ingenix acquired Picis Clinical Solutions, Inc., a health information provider for the high-acuity areas of hospitals.[30][31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Former LHI buildings in La Crosse\nIn 2011, Logistics Health, Inc. of La Crosse, Wisconsin, was acquired by OptumHealth.[32] In September 2014, the office buildings where LHI is based were sold to UnitedHealth Group for $45 million.[33][34]\n\n\nIn February 2012, the company acquired XLHealth, a sponsor of Medicare Advantage health plans with a primary focus on medicare recipients with special needs such as those with chronic illness and those eligible for Medicaid (\"dual eligibles\").[35] In October 2012, UnitedHealth Group and Amil Participações, one of the biggest Brazilian health insurance companies, completed the first phase of their merger.[36][37][38]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Optum secured a majority stake in the Washington, D.C.-based startup Audax Health.[39] Audax's CEO, Grant Verstandig, continued running the firm alongside COO David Ko.[39] In October 2014, Optum Health acquired the health services unit of Alere for $600 million cash.[40]\n\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that CatamaranRx would be acquired by OptumRx.[41]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company announced it was pulling out of all but a \"handful\" of state healthcare exchanges provided under Affordable Care Act and will continue to sell only in three states in 2017.[42][43]\n\n\nIn 2017, UnitedHealth's Optum unit acquired Rally Health,[44] a company started by Audax Health's executives.[45] Prior to acquisition, in 2015, UnitedHealth supported Rally Health as a majority investor,[46] and through enrolling 5 million UnitedHealth policy holders in Rally Health's flagship product, RallySM.[45][47][nt 1] The close relations between UnitedHealth, Audax Health and Rally Health follows a close personal relationship between Grant Vrestandig (Audax and Rally) and UnitedHealth's President and CFO at the time, David Wichmann.[48]\n\n\nIn June 2019, UnitedHealth's Optum division acquired Davita Medical Group from DaVita Inc. for $4.3 billion.[49][50][51] That year, the company also agreed to acquire Equian for $3.2 billion.[52][53][54][55] On June 19, 2019, UnitedHealth acquired the online patient community platform PatientsLikeMe for an undisclosed amount and it will be incorporated into UnitedHealth Group's research division.[56]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Andrew Witty was named president of UnitedHealth, in addition to his role as chief executive of the company's Optum division.[57]\n\n\nUnitedHealth announced in March 2022 that it would acquire LHC Group for $5.4 billion. The deal will expand its home health capabilities by combining LHC's services with UnitedHealth's Optum unit.[58]\n\n\nIn 2022, UnitedHealth Group said there would be no out-of-pocket costs for albuterol, epinephrine, glucagon, insulin, and naloxone for fully insured members starting in 2023. The discounts were guaranteed for less than a quarter of UnitedHealthcare's membership.[59]\n\n\n\n## Organizational structure[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has two subsidiaries: Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\n\n### Optum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Optum\n\nFormed in 2011, Optum says that it provides \"data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, healthcare delivery and healthcare operations\".[60]\n\n\nIt is organized into three businesses:\n\n\n\n* OptumHealth – provides primary and secondary care.[60][61]\n* OptumInsight – provides data analytics, technology, and operations services.[60]\n* OptumRX – provides pharmacy services and also.[60]\n\n\n### UnitedHealthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo for UnitedHealthcare\n**UnitedHealthcare** is an insurance and managed care company with four main divisions:\n\n\n\n* UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual – provides health benefit plans and services for large national employers.\n* UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement – provides health and well-being services to individuals age 65 and older.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Community and State – serves state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved, and people without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Global – serves 6.2 million people with medical benefits, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru but also in more than 130 other countries.[62]\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Health insurance plans[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare offers commercial group insurance plans across the United States under several product names with different offerings.[63]\n\n\n\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select** is an exclusive provider organization (EPO) with no coverage for out-of-network providers[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select Plus** is a preferred provider organization (PPO).[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Choice** functions as a HMO plan with access to specialists,[64] whereas UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus is a plan which allows for out-of-network coverage.[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Navigate, Charter, and Compass** require a primary care physician referral to see a specialist[63] meaning that they are more restrictive managed care plans, similar to point of service plans.\n\n\n#### Provider networks[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare negotiates with providers in periodic contract negotiation; contracts may be discontinued from time to time.[63] High-profile contract disputes can span provider networks across the nation, as in the case of a 2018 dispute with a major emergency room doctor group, Envision Healthcare.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Provider directory[edit]\n\n\nMaintaining up-to-date provider directories is necessary since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can fine insurers with outdated directories.[66] As a condition of participation, UnitedHealthcare requires that providers notify them of changes, but also has a Professional Verification Outreach program to proactively request information from providers.[63] However, providers are burdened by having to maintain their information with multiple networks (e.g., competitors to UnitedHealthcare). The total cost of maintaining these directories is estimated at $2.1b annually, and a blockchain initiative began in 2018 to share the directory.[66]\n\n\n\n## Finance[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported earnings of US$20.64 billion, with an annual revenue of US$324.16 billion.[67]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein million US$\n | Net incomein million US$\n | Total assetsin million US$\n | Price per sharein US$\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005[68] | 46,425\n | 3,083\n | 41,288\n | 45.24\n |  |\n| 2006[69] | 71,542\n | 4,159\n | 48,320\n | 44.83\n |  |\n| 2007[70] | 75,431\n | 4,654\n | 50,899\n | 45.91\n |  |\n| 2008[71] | 81,186\n | 2,977\n | 55,815\n | 28.40\n |  |\n| 2009[72] | 87,138\n | 3,822\n | 59,045\n | 23.10\n | 80,000\n |\n| 2010[73] | 94,155\n | 4,634\n | 63,063\n | 29.20\n | 87,000\n |\n| 2011[74] | 101,862\n | 5,142\n | 67,889\n | 41.68\n | 99,000\n |\n| 2012[75] | 110,618\n | 5,526\n | 80,885\n | 50.04\n | 133,000\n |\n| 2013[76] | 122,489\n | 5,625\n | 81,882\n | 60.29\n | 156,000\n |\n| 2014[77] | 130,474\n | 5,619\n | 86,382\n | 78.28\n | 170,000\n |\n| 2015[78] | 157,107\n | 5,813\n | 111,254\n | 111.06\n | 200,000\n |\n| 2016[79] | 184,840\n | 7,017\n | 122,810\n | 131.31\n | 230,000\n |\n| 2017[80] | 201,159\n | 10,558\n | 139,058\n | 183.48\n | 260,000\n |\n| 2018[81] | 226,247\n | 11,986\n | 152,221\n | 245.88\n | 300,000\n |\n| 2019[82] | 242,155\n | 13,839\n | 173,889\n | 249.59\n | 325,000\n |\n| 2020[82] | 257,141\n | 15,403\n | 197,289\n | 301.28\n | 330,000\n |\n| 2021[82] | 287,597\n | 17,285\n | 212,206\n | 403.71\n | 350,000\n |\n| 2022[82] | 324,162\n | 20,639\n | 245,705\n |  | 400,000\n |\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

UnitedHealth Group subsequently spent $2.75 million to $4.86 million from 2011 to 2021 and the company went on to pull in $78,692 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 alone.[83]\n\n\nThe UnitedHealth Group hired seven different lobbying firms to work on its behalf in 2010.[84] In addition, its corporate political action committee or PAC, called **United for Health,** spent an additional $1 million on lobbying activities in 2010.[85]\n\n\nQSSI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, is one of the 55 contractors hired by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to work on the HealthCare.gov web site.[86]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also begun by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the *Wall Street Journal* in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the *Journal*. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.[87] On October 15, 2006, CEO William W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire will repay $468 million, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution.[88][89][90]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.[91][92][93] This was the first time in which the little-used \"clawback\" provision under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC. The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class-action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[95]\n\n\n\n#### OptumInsight, aka Ingenix[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2008, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended \"to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.\" Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.[96]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest but admitted no wrongdoing.[97]\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.[98]\n\n\nOn October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Anthem Inc.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Investigations and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicare overbilling lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA whistleblower lawsuit, filed in 2011, charges UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) \"defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions — and likely billions — of dollars.\" Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act. The government said it would proceed on claims against two health care companies, UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management. In February 2017, a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case.[100][101]\n\n\n\n#### *Richard Cole, and others v. United Healthcare*[edit]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2019, Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a cancer survivor, recused himself from a case against United Healthcare, stating that the company's denial of treatment was \"immoral and barbaric\", and that his opinions regarding the company would prevent him from \"deciding this case fairly and impartially.\"[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### PacifiCare fine in California[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the California Department of Insurance took action against UnitedHealthcare's subsidiary PacifiCare Health Systems, acquired in 2005, ultimately fining UnitedHealthcare around $173 million for an estimated over 900,000 violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act; by 2019, the case was still being disputed in court, with the possibility of affirming $91 million in penalties.[104]\n\n\n\n#### CMS fine over Medicare Part D[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, CMS fined UnitedHealthcare after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.[105]\n\n\n\n#### New Jersey fine in 2018[edit]\n\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5 million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare assessed $1 million penalty for claims payment violations.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Northern California[edit]\n\n\nUnited Behavioral Health sued over $5 million in denied claims.[108]\n\n\n\n#### Policy Research ownership[edit]\n\n\nThe Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides an economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.[109]\nThe organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.[109]\nThe Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but alleges editorial and analytical \"independence\" from UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.[109]\nThe Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its website. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals.[110] For example, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act.[111] Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the former House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as \"the nonpartisan Lewin Group\" in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.\n\n\nSeveral Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and \"estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.\"[112]\n\n\nHowever, The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told *The Washington Post* that \"sometimes studies come out that don't show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have [the] option to bury the study.\"[113]\n\n\n\n#### Influencing the research of Yale University economist Zack Cooper[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, a report from *The Intercept* revealed that UnitedHealthcare worked behind the scenes to guide Yale University healthcare economist Zack Cooper's research on surprise medical billing.[114] United provided Cooper with anonymous data and made edits to his paper, which blamed physician networks TeamHealth and EmCare for the rise in balance billing. United Health Network CEO Dan Rosenthal later confirmed United's work with Cooper during a deposition in a lawsuit filed against United by TeamHealth.[115] Cooper's work was presented as independent, unbiased academic research before Congress, the White House, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and numerous media reports.[116]\n\n\n\n#### Underpaying physicians[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Tennessee-based physician network TeamHealth sued UnitedHealthcare in the 8th District Court of Clark County, Nevada, alleging the insurer underpaid claims to three of TeamHealth's Nevada-based affiliates. In November 2021, the jury unanimously found United guilty of \"oppression, fraud, and malice\" in its conduct and awarded TeamHealth $2.65 million in compensatory damages.[117] In December, the jury reconvened to determine punitive damages and awarded TeamHealth $60 million.[118] TeamHealth plans to pursue similar legal action against United and other insurers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Change Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the United States Department of Justice sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, arguing that the deal would give UnitedHealth access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare cost. The Justice Department said that UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at Humana, Anthem Inc, CVS Health, Aetna, and Cigna.[120] A U.S. judge rejected the department's bid in September. Following completion of the acquisition in October 2022, the parties agreed that the appeal would be voluntarily dismissed, with the Justice Department not providing reasons for dropping the appeal.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Medicare Advantage Overbilling[edit]\n\n\nThe New York Times report in October 2021 identified UnitedHealth in a list of Medicare insurers accused of over-billing. UnitedHealth has been accused by a whistle blower, accused of fraud by the U.S. government and over-billed according to the Inspector General. Executives at UnitedHealth Group told workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses, to identify diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed, inflating bills paid by the federal government's Medicare Advantage program.[122]\n\n\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2021, Medicare Advantage programs provided insurers with double the gross margin than insurance for individuals, groups, or Medicaid Managed Care.[123][124]\n\n\n\n## Foundations[edit]\n\n\nFoundations affiliated with UnitedHealth Group include the United Health Foundation (UHF) and the UnitedHealthcare Children's Foundation (UHCCF), both of which were established in 1999.[125]\n\n\nUHF pledged $100 million over ten years to fund scholarships and workforce development programs focused on increasing ethnic and racial diversity within the health care industry.[126]\n\n\nUHCCF administers grants to help pay for medical costs for families with coverage gaps. According to UHCCF, the foundation raises money for medical grants by selling gift items such as backpacks, books, cards, and games, some of which are created by children.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* America's Health Rankings (reports released annually in conjunction with UnitedHealth Group's United Health Foundation since 1990)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also referred to as Rally.(Staff (February 3, 2015). \"Rally Health Launches Digital Wellness Platform With Over 5M People\". *HIT Consultant*.
