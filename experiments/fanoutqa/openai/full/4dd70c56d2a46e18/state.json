Jazz violin is the use of the violin or electric violin to improvise solo lines. The earliest references to jazz performance using the violin as a solo instrument was during the first decades of the 20th century. Early jazz violinists included Eddie South, who played violin with Jimmy Wade's Dixielanders in Chicago; Stuff Smith; Claude \"Fiddler\" Williams, who played with Andy Kirk and his Twelve Clouds of Joy. Joe Venuti was best known for his work with guitarist Eddie Lang during the 1920s. Georgie Stoll was a jazz violinist who became an orchestra leader and film music director.\n\n\nSince that time there have been many superb improvising violinists including Noel Pointer, St\u00e9phane Grappelli, and Jean-Luc Ponty. While not primarily jazz violinists, Darol Anger, Adam Taubitz and Mark O'Connor have spent significant parts of their careers playing jazz, while emerging artists like Scott Tixier and Jeremy Kittel have devoted themselves almost exclusively to jazz both modern and traditional. Violins also appear in string ensembles or big bands supplying orchestral backgrounds to many jazz recordings.[1] Lately, extensive academic research on jazz violin has been conducted and published.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Alphabetically by last name[edit]\n\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.

Jazz violin is the use of the violin or electric violin to improvise solo lines. The earliest references to jazz performance using the violin as a solo instrument was during the first decades of the 20th century. Early jazz violinists included Eddie South, who played violin with Jimmy Wade's Dixielanders in Chicago; Stuff Smith; Claude \"Fiddler\" Williams, who played with Andy Kirk and his Twelve Clouds of Joy. Joe Venuti was best known for his work with guitarist Eddie Lang during the 1920s. Georgie Stoll was a jazz violinist who became an orchestra leader and film music director.\n\n\nSince that time there have been many superb improvising violinists including Noel Pointer, St\u00e9phane Grappelli, and Jean-Luc Ponty. While not primarily jazz violinists, Darol Anger, Adam Taubitz and Mark O'Connor have spent significant parts of their careers playing jazz, while emerging artists like Scott Tixier and Jeremy Kittel have devoted themselves almost exclusively to jazz both modern and traditional. Violins also appear in string ensembles or big bands supplying orchestral backgrounds to many jazz recordings.[1] Lately, extensive academic research on jazz violin has been conducted and published.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Alphabetically by last name[edit]\n\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.

His festival debut was at age 16.[1] He was in master classes with Nathan Milstein and Max Rostal.[2]\n\n\nIn 1994, Zehetmair formed a string quartet which bears his name. The Zehetmair Quartet performs all works entirely from memory, and learns one new programme a year.[3] Zehetmair has made several recordings for ECM, both as soloist and with his quartet.[2][4]\n\n\nZehetmair later developed a parallel career in conducting. In November 2001, he was named Music Director and chief conductor of the Northern Sinfonia (now the Royal Northern Sinfonia), his first conducting post, starting with the 2002\u20132003 season, for an initial contract of 3 years and 6 weeks of concerts each season.[5][6] In August 2005, he extended his contract for another 3 years through 2008.[7][8] He concluded his music directorship of the Royal Northern Sinfonia after the 2013\u20132014 season,[9] and now has the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra.

What mostly attracts attention are his solo and chamber music projects (the complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin or Beethoven and Brahms Sonatas from recent seasons). He is also appreciated for his taste and style and for his captivatingly beautiful tone.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n\u017denat\u00fd was born on 2 February 1962 in Lomnice nad Popelkou. The violinist began his professional career with his participation in the finale of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, followed by his debut with the Czech Philharmonic and Libor Pe\u0161ek and his first prize at the Prague Spring Competition. He earned the title of laureate at the UNESCO International Rostrum of Young Performers (1989). in 1990 Mr. \u017denat\u00fd made his debut in London, in 1991 at the Berliner Philharmonie and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, in 1994 in Tokyo and in 1996 in New York and Buenos Aires. He has collaborated with Yehudi Menuhin, Yo-Yo Ma, Serge Baudo, Valery Gergiev, Andrey Boreyko, Neville Marriner and many others.\n\n\nThe musicianship of \u017denat\u00fd has been influenced the most by his personal encounters with Nathan Milstein, Ruggiero Ricci and Andr\u00e9 Gertler, and a major change to his musical thinking was initiated by professor Bezrodny at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow. What he valuate at most, however, have been his private lessons with Josef Suk and many subsequent years of their collaboration, climaxing with performances at the Mozart Festival W\u00fcrzburg and the Prague Spring Festival and with a recording of the complete works of W. A. Mozart.\n\n\nHe has recorded the complete violin works of composers Telemann, Bach, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Schulhoff, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Grieg.[1] His new complete Dvo\u0159\u00e1k recording has attracted attention, as well as has his recording of both violin concertos by J. B. Foerster with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and its music director Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek.[2]\n\n\n\u017denat\u00fd played on Giuseppe Guarneri's violin Prince of Orange. Now he plays on another Guarneri violin made in 1740.\n\n\n\u017denat\u00fd has taught at Cleveland Institute of Music, Royal Danish Academy of Music and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1982 - Finalist of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow\n* 1987 - Winner of the International Prague Spring Violin Competition\n* 1989 - Laureate of the International Tribune of Young Performers UNESCO\n* 1990 - Main prize of the Ruggiero Ricci international master-classes in Berlin\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Schrade, Rorianne. \"Legato Arts Presents Ivan \u017denat\u00fd in Review\". *New York Concert Review, Inc*.

He wrote:\n\n\n*'There was the astonishing virtuosity of nine-year-old Leia Zhu who threw off Sibelius's Humoresque Opus 87 /2 with a speed and sense of feeling rivalled, in my experience, only by Aaron Rosand's recording.'* [115][116]\n\n\n**June 18, 2017, by W\u00fcrzburg Main Post**\n\n\n*'Virtuously she was able to trace the composer's romantic cosmos with unspent freshness with a powerful, luminous tone. As an encore, she played the incredibly fast \"Dance of the Goblins\" by Antonio Bazzini - standing ovations for this exceptional talent.*' [117]\n\n\n**June 20, 2017, by W\u00fcrzburg Main Post, of Zhu's Bartok's 44 Duos for 2 Violins' with Daniel Dodds, concert master of Festival Strigs Lucerne**\n\n\n*'As a special guest, Leia Zhu, who played a selection from Bart\u00f3k's \"44 Duos for 2 Violins\". In doing so, she was on an equal footing with her duo partner Dodds.*\n\n\n*The young violinist, who, in addition to great artistic maturity, exuded a relaxed, calm friendliness, immediately received accolades.'*[118]\n\n\n**June 27, 2017, by Mannheimer Morgen, of Zhu's Tchaikovsky Souvenir d'un lieu cher op.42 with Festival Strings Lucerne**\n\n\n*'The performance of the 11-year-old violinist Leia Zhu became a special event.*\n\n\n*She did not play with supposed childlike grace, not trained under ambitious parental pressure. The development of this amazing violin miracle happens in a natural maturation process. Her podium appearance was pretty self-confident.*\n\n\n*The violinic capers resulted from the concept of the composition. Through all sorts of technical tricks such as double grips, rapid gliding to high registers, flageolets, pizzicatos, through her brilliant finger and bow technique as well as through her enormous feeling for the elegant and profound execution of the three movements of Souvenir d'un lieu cher op.42 (Memory to a beloved place) by Peter Tchaikovsky, this exceptional artistic talent has already proven to be largely developed and perfect in every phase.*\n\n\n*Her technical ability, her remarkably mature expressiveness and the rhythmic pull of her playing led to enthusiastic applause.'*[119]\n\n\n**June 1, 2018, by the Strad, of Zhu's performance of Carmen Fantasie by Waxman with Novosibirsk Symphony Orchestra at the Trans-Siberian Art Festival**, the Strad wrote:\n\n\n*'Eleven-year-old British violinist Leia Zhu demonstrated a disarming security in the pyrotechnics that followed, with lightning-fast shifts, cut-glass harmonics and an obvious familiarity with the choreography of concerto performance.'* [120]\n\n\n**June 7, 2018, by Corriere Milano, of Zhu's recital in Conservatorio di musica \"Giuseppe Verdi\" di Milano**, it wrote:\n\n\n*'Not yet twelve years old is to present a musical programme like that heard last night in the conservatory for the Concert Society is particularly courageous.*\n\n\n*This is what the amazing violinist Leia Zhu is doing around the world who has certainly not exaggerated in the choice of songs often of high virtuosity performed with her excellent 3\u20444 violin, indeed the songs performed they were absolutely within her reach and the executive maturity was that of a virtuous adult in his career for years.*\n\n\n*It should be listened to closed eyes not to be conditioned, as often happens, right or wrong, by the words 'child prodigy'.*\n\n\n*Nothing can be said to listen to justify of the age: Leia Zhu, the eleven \u2013 twelve in October \u2013 of Newcastle is perfect, highly expressive and overcomes any technical difficulty without any effort.*\n\n\n*The variegated programme, which the talented Jennifer Hughes on the piano, foresaw a sonata of Beethoven, the Op. 12 No 3, then the Carmen Fantasie in the effective reworking of Waxman, then two works of Mozart as the Adagio in E major K261 and the Rondo in D major K 373, a violin solo with Fritz Kreisler and his Recitativo and Scherzo-Caprice Op 6. At the end is the famous Paganini La Campanella.*\n\n\n*Splendid synergistic balance between the pianist and the violinist: Hughes was very attentive to the volumes of the small but tonally excellent violin of Zhu. Leia has been excellent both in the most classical and less virtuosically moments of Beethoven's sonata and Mozart songs, and in the every virtuosic situation from Carmen to Kreisler, to the well-known La Campanella, with those perfect in intonation and dynamic relationship.*\n\n\n*The presence of the little girl in bright red dress, has underlines even more. An evening that will remain indelibly in the memories of the many in the Sala Verdi. All convinced and gave thunderous applause.*\n\n\n*The two encores are excellent: Veracini, Largo from Sonata No 6 and Kreisler, the Marche miniature Viennoise.'* [121]\n\n\n**June 3, 2019, by Ynet News (Israel), of Zhu's performance at the Israel Conservatory of Music in Tel Aviv**. It wrote:\n\n\n*'Zhu took the stage for the second piece on the program, the Concerto No. 5 for Violin\u2014the Turkish\u2014by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The gifted young violinist performed flawlessly, demonstrating virtuosity throughout the three movements, whether the tempo was allegro, adagio or rondeaux-minuetto.'* [122]\n\n\n**July 13, 2019, by Osterhofener Anzeiger, of Zhu's performance of *Paganini Cantabile, Paganini La Campanella and Bach Partita No. 3.*** It wrote:\n\n\n*'Deeply relaxed and devilishly sovereign*\n\n\n*The game was also supernatural the only twelve year old Leia Zhu, not only, as one might think, drilled virtuosity, but rather showed a precocious seriousness that is second to none.*\n\n\n*She convinced dream-walkers the audience with their velvety bow at the \"Cantabile\", where Paganini to the sound aesthetics the opera arias and it allows the solo instrument to indulge in large arcs of melody.*\n\n\n*Leia Zhu proved that there is no relationship between age or talent of a person and her maturity and that artistic maturity is not required associated with human. Just while talking to the Osterhofener Anzeiger during the break, a little, almost shy girl who despite being deeply relaxed, Leia transforms into an adult full professional. Completely withdrawn and completely from the ingested music reaches them in the devilishly heavy violin magic of Paganini's \"La Campanella\", especially with her double-grip play, a level that one even without a child prodigy bonus amazes.*\n\n\n*The joy of playing of all artists carried over that evening too on viewers who don't let go without any encores. So Leia Zhu, who found it \"a great privilege\" to \"play in this spectacular place,\" gave Bach's \"Partita No. 3\" solo confidently to the best thing in this acoustics too sounded spectacular.'*[123]\n\n\n**July 13, 2019, by Osterhofener Anzeiger, of Zhu's performance of *Paganini Cantabile, Paganini La Campanella* with Festival Strings Lucerne***.* It wrote:\n\n\n*'The appearance of the British violinist Leia Zhu, who has Chinese roots, is almost even more spectacular is not even thirteen years old: a \"child prodigy\", as announced in the program. With Niccol\u00f2 Paganini's \"Cantabile\" intones melt and sweetness, with smooth transitions between high register and sonorous depth. Of course, one was particularly excited beforehand to see how Leia Zhu performed the solo part of \"La Campanella\", Paganini's virtuoso bell rondo. Here nothing was left to be desired: like a savvy professional If the young violinist is up to Paganini's witchcraft, she leaves the bow light at a crazy pace Dance across the strings and amazes with rapid changes between bowed and pizzicato notes.'* [124]\n\n\n**September 19, 2019, by Oltner Tagblatt, of Zhu's performance of *\"Havanaise\" in E major, op. 83 by the French Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Paganini La Campanella* with Festival Strings Lucerne*.*** It wrote:\n\n\n*'The young musician inspires the audience.'*\n\n\n*'A schoolgirl in an overly long, red evening dress climbs the stage in the concert hall and smiles a little shyly: At first glance, Leia Zhu corresponds to the clich\u00e9 we have of child prodigies. But then she starts the violin in front of a nearly sold out house and suddenly we no longer see a child's face, but the serious face of an adult artist. With verve and full of energy, she sets the tempo for the chamber orchestra and the excellent musicians of the Festival Strings Lucerne like to follow the dictation of the little virtuoso in the rhythmically strongly accented \"Havanaise\" in E major, op. 83 by the French Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. With a maturity and seriousness that is absolutely amazing for her age, Leia creates this demanding dance piece. The beautiful, full tone of her violin fills the concert hall; Leia plays a valuable violin made by the Venetian violin maker Michele Deconet, which a private collector has made available to her on loan.*\n\n\n*Immediately after the break, the likeable child star turns to what is probably the most famous of all violinists: Niccol\u00f2 Paganini composed primarily to demonstrate his own virtuosity as an artist with his technically incredibly demanding works. Leia Zhu already masters some particularly demanding tone sequences in the almost romantic \"Cantabile\" in D major, Op. 17. \"La Campanella\" is considered Paganini's showpiece and is still a touchstone for string players to this day. Leia seems very confident, places the chords on top of each other in a flash and climbs dizzying heights with her instrument - she is visibly delighted with her skills. The young artist was rewarded by the enthusiastic audience with a standing ovation.*\n\n\n*Leia Zhu said goodbye with a Bach encore, played bravely solo. What had one seen and heard: A gifted schoolgirl on the way to a great career.*'[125]\n\n\n**October 13, 2020, by Luzerner Zeitung of Zhu's chamber music with members of Festival Strings Lucerne.** It wrote:\n\n\n*For sure, she's the typical prodigy. At only 13 years old, she plays the violin and has the total control of all the technical difficulties. Almost at the same time she started going to school in Newcastle, she also joined the Guildhall School of Music in London. At the age of 7 she began to take masterclasses, then started playing concerts and soon appeared at festivals.*\n\n\n*Everyone wanted to see and hear this British girl with Chinese roots. London, the Salzburg Festival, Moscow and the Berliner Philharmonie. In summer 2018, as the youngest in the \"child prodigies\" series at Lucerne Festival, Leia Zhu performed with the Festival Strings Lucerne.*\n\n\n*AT 13, MATURE LIKE AN OLD SOUL*\n\n\n*At the age of 13, mature like a veteran and yet when you look at this young lady on Sunday evening in the Hotel Schweizerhof at second concert of the new Chamber Music series of the \u00abChamberPlayers\u00bb the Festival Strings playing, your eyes could not believe what your ears hear.*\n\n\n*Here is the expression 'the child prodigy' seems come from a different world. Leia's presentation and performance are astounding not simply because she is \"young\", but because it is convincing.*\n\n\n*Together with Jonas Iten, principal cellist of the Festival Strings, Leia displayed a fiery mix of brilliance and depth in a most evocative way. Between them they performed this gripping music quite theatrically. The first movement passed mysteriously and eerily. Then the performance got denser until the wild steps in this dark mania got broken.*\n\n\n*The second movement is gorgeous. The figures move in a nostalgic and fragile mood from the cello to the violin. A lost bit of earth, far away from homeland and security. Leia Zhu and Jonas Iten flow in these waves as if from a single body. Their playing is crystal clear. Sounds are chosen with care and transparency. A rich and inspiring moment.*[126]\n\n\n**October 16, 2021,** **by Luzerner Zeitung of Zhu's Tchaikovesky Violin Concerto with Festival Strings Lucerne(without conductor).** It wrote:\n\n\n*'From Child Prodigy to Mature Artist'*\n\n\n*'colorful, expressive, powerful.\u2019*\n\n\n*'She ( Leia) communicates with the eyes, body tension and attention orchestral musicians.*\n\n\n*She looks very relaxed, smiles even in the most difficult passages, whether double stops, highest sounds or ludicrously fast runs, everything seems effortless.*\n\n\n*And as in the slow movement, the melodies breathe, long cantilenas bloom in dense legato, this is great art. The dialogues with clarinet and Flute are particularly intimate.'*[127]\n\n\n**November 9, 2021,** **by Carrierebit**[128] **of Leia Zhu Open the 41st Season of the Cantelli Festival in Novara**\n\n\n*'We confess that we were expecting the usual Chinese enfant prodigy, all astounding technical skill and zero interpretative and expressive ability. Our surprise in listening to her was great: Leia has already matured her own sound, her ability to make technical acrobatics not a spectacular end, but a means to give voice to a feeling, an emotion, a spiritual world evoked by sound.*\n\n\n*Her faring is intense, above all crystalline in the sound, even in the upper register, or in the very rapid scales and trills, but what struck us most is his excellent ability to vary dynamics with mature knowledge, colouring and returning a sound that is always rich in nuances and chiaroscuro.*\n\n\n*Hence the beautiful interpretative rendition of passages such as the Serenata and the Gavotta of the Italian Suite, but also the most fiercely virtuosic piece of Wieniawski's Fantasia came out of Leia Zhu's violin not as a cloying effect number, but as an effective and involving some of the most dramatic or pathetic moments in Gounod's work.'* [129]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"International Holocaust Commemoration Day Ceremony\" (PDF).

Since 1998 his regular partner is Italian pianist Enrico Pace.[2][3] Other regular chamber music partners are Heinrich Schiff, Piotr Anderszewski[4] and Christian Zacharias.[5]\n\n\n\n## Stradivarius[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2015, Zimmermann played a 1711 Stradivarius violin known as the \"Lady Inchiquin\", previously played by Fritz Kreisler.[6] The violin had been loaned to Zimmermann by D\u00fcsseldorf-based bank WestLB AG, but was reclaimed in February 2015 at the termination of the loan contract by the bank's legal successor, Portigon Financial Services, owing to the bank's bankruptcy.[7]\n\n\nIn January 2016 Zimmermann was loaned the 1727 \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Dupont\" Stradivarius for an initial period of two years.[8] Also known as the \"Grumiaux\" Stradivarius, it had been owned by the celebrated Belgian virtuoso Arthur Grumiaux. The instrument is owned by entrepreneur, philanthropist and amateur violinist Mr Yu, who purchased it in February 2015 through Rare Violins of New York for an undisclosed sum \u2013 making the violin the first Stradivarius to be owned by a private individual on the Chinese mainland.[9]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Zimmermann regained the 1711 ex-Fritz Kreisler 'Lady Inchiquin' Stradivarius violin.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Artists \u2013 Frank Peter Zimmerman\".

His father had originally emigrated from Poland to Israel, and his mother's family had settled in Denmark before World War II.[2] His teachers have included Milan Vitek and Boris Kuschnir.\n\n\nIn June 1992, Szeps-Znaider won the first prize of the 4th International Carl Nielsen International Music Competition. In 1995 he was awarded 3rd prize at International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition. In 1997 he became a 1st prize winner of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels. He continued his violin studies with Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard School of Music.\n\n\nIn his conducting career, Szeps-Znaider counted Sir Colin Davis among his mentors. Szeps-Znaider has held principal guest conductor posts with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra and the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra.[3] In December 2017, Szeps-Znaider first guest-conducted the Orchestre national de Lyon. In December 2018, the ONL announced the appointment of Szeps-Znaider as its next music director, effective September 2020, with an initial contract of 4 seasons.[4]\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider has made commercial recordings for such labels as RCA Victor Red Seal and LSO Live. His discography includes the following works:\n\n\n\n* The complete Mozart Violin Concertos with the London Symphony Orchestra, directed from the violin[5]\n* Nielsen: Violin Concerto with Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic\n* Elgar: Violin Concerto in B minor, with Sir Colin Davis and the Staatskapelle Dresden\n* Brahms and Korngold: violin concertos, with Valery Gergiev and the Vienna Philharmonic\n* Beethoven and Mendelssohn: violin concertos, with Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic\n* Prokofiev, Violin Concerto No. 2, and Glazunov, Violin Concerto, with Mariss Jansons and the Bavarian Radio Symphony\n* Felix Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto (DVD) with Riccardo Chailly and the Gewandhaus Orchestra\n* Brahms: chamber music for violin and piano, with Yefim Bronfman\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider spent ten years as Founder and Artistic Director of the annual Nordic Music Academy summer school. He is now President of the Carl Nielsen Competition. He is also Viotti Visiting Professor of Music at the Royal Academy of Music, London.[6]\n\n\nSzeps-Znaider plays the Guarneri \u201cdel Gesu\u201d violin, built in 1741, on extended loan to him by The Royal Danish Theater through the generosity of the VELUX Foundations, the Villum Fonden and the Knud H\u00f8jgaard Foundation. Previously played by Fritz Kreisler, the violin is thus known as the \"Ex-Kreisler Guarnerius\".\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Szeps-Znaider has also used the name 'Nikolaj Znaider' professionally in the past.\n2. **^** Duchen, Jessica (November 23, 2010). \"Interview: Nikolaj Znaider\".

His father then taught him to play the clarinet and then the violin at age eight. Early studies were at the Samuel Rubin Academy of Music (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music). Isaac Stern and Pablo Casals learned of Zukerman's violin talent during a 1962 visit to Israel. Zukerman subsequently moved to the United States that year to study at the Juilliard School[3] under Stern and Ivan Galamian. He made his New York City debut in 1963. In 1967, he shared the Leventritt Prize with the Korean violinist Kyung-wha Chung. His 1969 debut recordings of the concerti by Tchaikovsky (under the direction of Antal Dorati, with the London Symphony Orchestra) and Mendelssohn (with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic) launched a successful recording career of over 110 releases.\n\n\nZukerman launched his conducting career in 1970 with the English Chamber Orchestra, and served as director of London's South Bank Festival from 1971 to 1974. In the US, Zukerman was music director of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra from 1980 to 1987. He later directed the summer festivals of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra (1991\u201395) and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (1996\u201399). In 1999, he became Music Director of Canada's National Arts Centre Orchestra (NACO) in Ottawa,[4][5] stepping down from the post in 2015. He has served as Principal Guest Conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra since 2009.\n\n\nZukerman is on the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music and is the head and founder of the Zukerman Performance Program at the school. His former students include Koh Gabriel Kameda, Julian Rachlin, and Guy Braunstein. In 1999 he founded the National Arts Centre Young Artists Programme, which counts young musicians such as Viviane Hagner, Jessica Linnebach, and Antal Szalai as alumni. In 2006 Zukerman began his involvement in the Rolex Artistic Mentorship programme.\n\n\nZukerman plays the \"Dushkin\" Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violin of 1742. His honors include the King Solomon Award, the National Medal of Arts (presented by President Reagan in 1983), the Isaac Stern Award for Artistic Excellence, and an honorary doctorate from Brown University.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nZukerman married Eugenia Rich in 1968.[6] The couple had two daughters together, opera singer Arianna Zukerman and blues/folk musician Natalia Zukerman.[7][8][9] They frequently appeared together in concert until their separation in 1983. Zukerman was then married to actress Tuesday Weld from 1985 to 2001.[10] He and Weld owned homes in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Montauk, New York, which they bought after the murder-suicide of its previous owners, soap opera actress Gwyda Donhowe and Broadway producer Norman Kean.[11][12] Zukerman and his third wife, cellist Amanda Forsyth, have been married since 2004 and primarily reside in Manhattan. They often appear as soloists together.\n\n\n\n## Recordings[edit]\n\n\nHis recordings have received 21 Grammy nominations, and two Grammy wins.[13] He has collaborated with filmmaker Christopher Nupen on several projects, and was the subject of Nupen's \"Pinchas Zukerman: Here to Make Music\" documentary of 1974. In 2003 he founded a string quintet, the Zukerman Chamber Players, which has released three CD recordings in addition to its roster of live performances.\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n* 2015: Brahms: Double concerto \u2013 Symphony No. 4 (Analekta), AN2 8782\n* 2016: Baroque Treasury (Analekta), AN2 8783\n* 2016: Vaughan Williams & Elgar \u2013 Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (Decca)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Britannica biography\n2. **^** Interview on Youtube\n3. **^** Slonimsky, Nicolas (1978). \"Zukerman, Pinchas\". *Baker's Biographical dictionary of musicians* (6th\u00a0ed.).

He is Music Director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and of the New York Philharmonic, and the music director-designate of the Seoul Philharmonic.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nVan Zweden was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands. His father, a pianist, encouraged him to begin violin studies at age five, and he studied music in Amsterdam. At age 15, he won the Oskar Back violin competition; this allowed him to attend the Juilliard School in the United States where he studied with Dorothy DeLay.[1]\n\n\n\n### Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1979, at age 18, van Zweden became one of the two first chairs of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. He was the youngest violinist ever to assume that position, which he held until 1995.[*citation needed*] He performed as a soloist with many other orchestras as well.\n\n\nVan Zweden began to work as a conductor after Leonard Bernstein invited him to lead an orchestra rehearsal in Berlin. He has stated that he learned much about conducting from observing the various conductors who led concerts of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. He conducted smaller ensembles initially, and became a full-time conductor in 1997.[2] His first Dutch conducting post was as chief conductor with the Orkest van het Oosten (Orchestra of the East, or the Netherlands Symphony Orchestra) in Enschede, the Netherlands. He served in this post from 1996 through 2000. Van Zweden was chief conductor of the Residentie Orchestra in The Hague from 2000 until 2005, and he recorded the complete symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven with them. In 2005 he became chief conductor and artistic leader of the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest (RFO; Netherlands Radio Philharmonic) in Hilversum. In February 2007 he extended his RFO contract through 2013.[3] In August 2010, the orchestra announced that van Zweden would step down from the RFO chief conductorship in 2012 and take the position of honorary guest conductor.[4] Van Zweden served as chief conductor of the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra from 2008 to 2011.[5][6]\n\n\nOutside Europe, van Zweden made his U.S. conducting debut with the St. Louis Symphony in 1996. His second US guest-conducting appearance was with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in February 2006, a concert that was highly acclaimed.[7] Based on this engagement the Dallas Symphony named Van Zweden their next music director after Andrew Litton, effective with the 2008/09 season.[2] His initial contract was for four years, where in the first year he was scheduled to conduct 12 weeks of subscription concerts and then for 15 weeks in the subsequent three years. For the 2007\u20132008 season, he held the title of music director-designate. In October 2009, the Dallas Symphony announced the extension of his contract through the 2015\u20132016 season.[8] In November 2013, the orchestra announced a further extension of his contract through 2019.[9] In January 2016, the Dallas Symphony announced a revised conclusion of van Zweden's tenure for the close of the 2017\u20132018 season, one season earlier than his most recent Dallas contract. With the 2018\u20132019 season, van Zweden took the title of conductor laureate of the Dallas Symphony, for the period from 2018 until 2021.[10]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil) announced the appointment of van Zweden as its next music director, with an initial contract of four years, starting 1 August 2012.[11] He made his debut as the music director of the orchestra on 28 September 2012.[12] In June 2016, van Zweden extended his contract with the HK Phil through the 2021\u20132022 season.[13] In June 2020, the HK Phil announced the further extension of van Zweden's contract through the 2023\u20132024 season, at which time he is scheduled to stand down from the post and to take the title of conductor laureate.[14]\n\n\nVan Zweden first guest-conducted the New York Philharmonic in April 2012.[15] He returned for subsequent engagements in November 2014 and October 2015.[16][17] In January 2016, the New York Philharmonic announced the appointment of van Zweden as its next music director, effective with the 2018/19 season, with an initial contract of five years. Van Zweden served as music director designate for the 2017/18 season.[18] In September 2021, van Zweden said he intended to resign the New York Philharmonic music directorship at the close of the 2023\u20132024 season.[19]\n\n\nIn September 2022, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra announced van Zweden's appointment as its next music director, effective January 2024, with an initial contract of 5 years.[20][21]\n\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSince 1983, van Zweden has been married to the artist Aaltje van Zweden\u2013van Buuren. They have a daughter, Anna-Sophia, and three sons, Daniel, Benjamin and Alexander. The van Zwedens have a particular interest in autism, as their son Benjamin is autistic.[2] In 2000, the van Zwedens set up the Papageno Foundation to provide autistic children with music therapy.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tim Madigan, \"Conductor Jaap van Zweden's performance applauded from every corner\". *Dallas Star-Telegram*, 28 September 2008.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Scott Cantrell, \"New director for DSO\". *Dallas Morning News*, 1 February 2007.\n3. **^** Vivien Schweitzer (1 February 2007). \"Dallas Symphony Names Jaap van Zweden Music Director\". *Playbill Arts*.

She is a graduate of Harvard College, from which she obtained music and French degrees while studying with Michele Auclair and Miriam Fried. She then was awarded the *David McCord Prize* there as well winning the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra Concerto Competition. Later, she obtained a master's degree from the Juilliard School, where she was under the guidance of Robert Mann. She also was mentored by coaches Michele Auclair, Miriam Fried, Hyo Kang, Andr\u00e1s Keller, Robert Levin, and Marylou Speaker Churchill.\n\n\n\n## Performances[edit]\n\n\nShe has performed with such quartets as Daedalus, Formosa, and the Momenta in both Singapore and China, across Europe, and throughout the United States, and was a member of the TinAlley String Quartet of Australia. She also was a frequent music festival participant and appeared in such events as the Bridgehampton, the Caramoor, the Olympic, and many others.[2] She also played violin at the National Gallery of Art and Lincoln Center and performed at places as diverse as Bethlehem, Boston, Columbia, Denton, Philadelphia, the US Capitol, and Tokyo's university, where she talked on TEDx in 2012. In 2010, she became first violinist of the Ying Quartet and Associate Professor at the Eastman School of Music. She has recorded three CDs with the Ying Quartet. When not performing, Ayano Ninomiya is a Kokikai practitioner and plays a 2010 violin by living maker Mario Miralles.[3]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nShe placed second in the Violin Competition of 2003 sponsored by the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation.[4]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ayano Ninomiya\". S&R Foundation. Archived from the original on February 3, 2014.

He began his concert career very young, winning the Vercelli \"Viotti\" International Competition at the age of 16, with Yehudi Menuhin as President of the panel of judges. Successes followed at competitions such as the \"Thibaud\" in Paris, the \"Sigall\" in Vi\u00f1a del Mar and the \"Francescatti\" in Marseilles and, in particular, in 1988 the \"Eurovision\" which brought him international fame thanks to the final round broadcast throughout Europe from the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\n\n\nSince then, his intense work schedule as a soloist has brought him to perform all over the world. He has played in London (Barbican Centre), Paris (Salle Pleyel), Tokyo (Suntory Hall), Geneva (Victoria Hall), Madrid (Teatro Monumental), Dublin (National Concert Hall), Istanbul (Atat\u00fcrk Centre), Rome (Accademia di Santa Cecilia e Teatro dell\u2019Opera), Moscow (Conservatoire Tchaikovskij), New York City (Carnegie Hall), Vienna (Konzerthaus), Z\u00fcrich (Tonhalle), St.Petersburg (Philharmonic Great Hall), Prague (Spring Festival), Milan (Teatro Alla Scala) and with many prestigious orchestras.\n\n\nIn Italy, he has performed almost everywhere. He signed a recording agreement with the Sony Music Group and his first CD for Sony Classical was released in March 2013.[1] He is currently the Artistic Director of the Citt\u00e0 di Brescia International Violin Competition, competition member of the WFIMC (World Federation of International Music Competitions).[2][*dead link*]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n* Busoni and Malipiero, Violin Concertos (Sony Classical)\n* Respighi, Dallapiccola and Petrassi, Violin Concertos (Sony Classical)\n* Casella and Castelnuovo Tedesco, Violin Concertos (Sony Classical)\n* Mozart, Violin Concertos (Velut Luna)\n* Mendelssohn, Violin Concertos (Amadeus)\n* Ysa\u00ffe, Sonatas op.27 (Decca)\n* Brahms, Sonatas for Viola and Violin (Decca)\n* \"Capriccio\", Recital (Decca)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sony Classical, cd with music by Respighi, Dallapiccola and Petrassi on klassik.sonymusic.de\".

He performs and teaches internationally as an improvisational violinist, and at the intersections of performing and multimedia arts, philosophy, and ecology.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1950, Nachmanovitch grew up in Los Angeles and studied at Harvard University and the University of California at Santa Cruz, where he earned a PhD in the History of Consciousness for an exploration of William Blake. His mentor was the anthropologist and philosopher Gregory Bateson. At Harvard he worked with Jerome Bruner and Irven DeVore. He has taught and lectured widely in the United States and abroad on creativity and the spiritual underpinnings of art. In the 1970s he was a pioneer in free improvisation on violin, viola and electric violin[1] and opened up many techniques now used in electroacoustic music. He has presented master classes and workshops in improvisation at many conservatories and universities worldwide, including the Yehudi Menuhin School and Juilliard. He has had numerous appearances on radio, television, and at music and theater festivals. He has collaborated with other artists in media including music, dance, theater, and film, and has developed programs melding art, music, literature, and computer technology. He has published articles in a variety of fields since 1966, and is the author of *Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art* (Penguin-Tarcher, 1990), and *The Art of Is: Improvising as a Way of Life*, (New World Library, 2019). Much of his teaching beyond music and the arts relates to the universality of improvisation and creativity in all fields of life, and the accessibility of improvisational process to each person at each moment[2]\n\n\n\n\n> \n> It is the most normal thing in the world to improvise. We improvise every time we say a sentence, but we are told in our veneration of the masters that the creative process is some sort of mysterious and godlike thing only possessed by a few people \u2013 when in fact we are improvising all the time, creating all the time.[3]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s he created computer music software including *The World Music Menu* (first developed 1987, new versions through 2007),[4] and the visual music software tools *Zmusic* (first presented at the Visual Music Alliance, Los Angeles, 1987) and *Visual Music Tone Painter* (first developed 1992, new versions through 2007).[5]\n\n\nIn the years following the millennium his time has been divided between improvisation concerts on violin, viola, electric violin and viola d'amore, both solo and in partnership with other musicians, dancers, and theater artists, lecturing and teaching workshops on improvisation, writing about creativity and about the influence of Gregory Bateson on modern thought, and visual music and other multimedia works.\n\n\nHe has served on the boards of the International Society for Improvised Music,[6] the New Violin Family Association[7] and the Bateson Idea Group.\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n#### Books[edit]\n\n\n* The Art of Is: Improvising as a Way of Life (New World Library, 2019).

Everybody in his family was involved in music: his father and his uncle were violinists, his mother a pianist and his sister a cellist. He received his first violin lessons from his father, with whom he started to study seriously when he was 4\u20135 years old. At 6 he enrolled at the Dinu Lipatti Music School and then at George Enescu Music High School where he was a first prize student. He played with his father at weddings and celebrations and developed his improvisation skills. When he was about 13 he heard violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli, who would become his idol and jazz his main attraction.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991 he left for Paris to fulfill his dream of meeting Grappelli and making a name in jazz. He got his first gig at a Russian cabaret. He enrolled in the Conservatoire de Paris, although his jazz teacher told him from the first audition that he shouldn't waste his time and should be playing on stage. He continued to play on various scenes with various musicians.\n\n\nNiculescu met Grappelli in 1994. Grappelli proposed they record an album, but Niculescu declined, believing that he didn't deserve the honor. He hoped to receive some lessons from Grappelli but Grappelli told him that he has nothing to teach him as the Romani had a fantastic natural technique.[*citation needed*] In 1995 he joined Romane's band, and in 2001 he was invited by Bir\u00e9li Lagr\u00e8ne to join his Gipsy Project inspired by the Quintette du Hot Club de France.\n\n\nHe has worked with Roberto Alagna, Charles Aznavour, Marcel Azzola, George Benson, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Patrick Bruel, Regina Carter, Angelo Debarre, Angela Gheorghiu, Johnny Hallyday, Hot Club de Norv\u00e8ge, Patricia Kaas, Jon Larsen, Giani Lincan, Wynton Marsalis, John McLaughlin, Oscar Peterson, Bucky Pizzarelli, Babik Reinhardt, Jimmy Rosenberg, Henri Salvador, and Tchavolo Schmitt.

He studied at the music conservatory in Basel, Switzerland, with Jean-Jacques Kantorow. He also met and worked with Walter Levin, Wytold Lutoslavsky, Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g, Hans Werner Henze etc, cultivating an interest in contemporary music.\n\n\nAs a violinist, he participated and was awarded in many competitions, the Tibor Varga competition, Paganini competition at Genoa, Italy, Brescia and Vaclav Hummel competition at Zagreb. \nIn 1989, he became concertmaster of Orchestre d'Auvergne, a post he held until 1999.\n\n\nNikolitch has been as well the leader of the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Prince consort professor at the Royal College of Music in London, giving masterclasses at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, he also teaches Master since 2005 at the CODARTS, Rotterdam Conservatory of Music and since 2017 he is Professor at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Saarbr\u00fccken. Since September 2021, he is appointed as a violin teacher at Paris Conservatoire CNSMdP.\n\n\nIn 2004 he was named artistic director of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, Amsterdam, a group created in the 1950es by Szymon Goldberg, the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic from the times of their conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. It was more than natural to take the same approach of directing from the concertmaster position and the hundreds of concerts played in the Concertgebouw Amsterdam have been oriented towards the most flexible interaction of all musicians involved. Playing in the hall of the Royal Concertgebouw with this group of motivated musicians became a constant source of inspiration that helps greatly define the (ever moving) platform of ideas on music making.\n\n\n2006-2011 he was Musical Director of St George Strings, an orchestra based in Belgrade, Serbia.\n\n\nSince 2007 Musical Director of BandArt orchestra with among others performances of operas Gluck\u2019s Orpheo, and Mozart\u2019s Idomeneo, in festivals of Peralada, Ludwigsbourg, Luzern. The latest collaboration with OSCyL featured on the programme the Schubert \u201cUnfinished\u201d and Bruckner 9 symphonies.\n\n\nNikolitch shares his experience by directing many other orchestras, among them Orquesta Nacional d'Espa\u00f1a, Orquesta d'opera Madrid, Orchestre National D'\u00cele de France, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de chambre de Geneve, Antwerp Symphony Orchestra, Tapiola Sinfonietta, Australian Chamber Orchestra, Manchester Camerata, Radio Simfonijski orkestar Slovenija, OSCyL etc.\n\n\nHe plays violins by Paul Belin fecit anno 2016 and a Petrus Guarnerius Venice offered graciously to use by a generous sponsor, bows by F.X. Tourte and J.P.M. Persoit, having in the past played violins by Giuseppe Guarneri, Gaspare Lorenzini, Matteo Goffriler and Lorenzo Storioni.\n\n\n\n## A list of records (non exhaustive)[edit]\n\n\n* Mozart.

In November 2001, he was named Music Director and chief conductor of the Northern Sinfonia (now the Royal Northern Sinfonia), his first conducting post, starting with the 2002\u20132003 season, for an initial contract of 3 years and 6 weeks of concerts each season.[5][6] In August 2005, he extended his contract for another 3 years through 2008.[7][8] He concluded his music directorship of the Royal Northern Sinfonia after the 2013\u20132014 season,[9] and now has the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra. He became an Artistic Partner of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra in Minnesota in 2010.[10] In June 2015, the Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur announced the appointment of Zehetmair as its next principal conductor, effective September 2016, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.[11] He is scheduled to conclude his Winterthur tenure at the close of the 2020\u20132021 season.[12]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra announced the appointment of Zehetmair as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019\u20132020 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.[13] In March 2021, the Orchestre national d'Auvergne announced the appointment of Zehetmair as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2021\u20132022 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.[14] Since May 2022, he has been Principal Conductor and Artistic Partner of the Irish Chamber Orchestra.[15]\n\n\nZehetmair is married to the violist Ruth Killius,[16] who is also a member of the Zehetmair Quartet. He holds honorary doctorates from the Music Academy Franz Liszt in Weimar and Newcastle University.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Alfred Hickling (2002-10-04). \"Top of the league\". *The Guardian*.
