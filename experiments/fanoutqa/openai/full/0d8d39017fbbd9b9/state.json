          "content": "\"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace\" is a 1999 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the fourth film in the Star Wars series and the first film of the prequel trilogy. The story is set 32 years before the original trilogy and follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they protect Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. They are joined by Anakin Skywalker, a young slave with strong natural powers of the Force, and contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.\n\nThe film stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August, and Frank Oz. It was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The film was released on May 19, 1999, and received mixed reviews, with praise for its visual effects but criticism for its exposition and characters, particularly Jar Jar Binks. Despite this, it was a box-office success, grossing over $1 billion worldwide.\n\nThe plot involves the Trade Federation blockading the planet Naboo, leading to an invasion. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to negotiate but are attacked and escape to Naboo. They rescue Queen Amidala and flee to the Republic capital planet of Coruscant. Along the way, they meet Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine, who is believed to be the prophesied \"Chosen One.\" The film culminates in a battle on Naboo, where Anakin helps destroy the Federation's control ship, and Qui-Gon is killed by Darth Maul, who is then defeated by Obi-Wan.\n\nThe film's production involved extensive use of digital effects, and it marked Lucas' return to directing after a 22-year hiatus. The film's score was composed by John Williams, featuring the notable track \"Duel of the Fates.\" The film was re-released in 3D in 2012, further boosting its box office gross. It has since become a significant part of the Star Wars franchise, leading to sequels and various adaptations in other media.",

Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939\u20131942 release (roadshow/\u200bgeneral release/\u200bsecond-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry\u2014after it took back the record\u2014includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnother film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film *Deep Throat*.

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules\u2014especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year\u2014and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915\u20131919 at slightly more than $5.2\u00a0million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2\u00a0million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** Block, Alex Ben (2010), *She Done Him Wrong*, p.\u00a0173, The worldwide rentals of over $3\u00a0million keep the lights on at Paramount, which did not shy away from selling the movie's sex appeal.

The prints were battered, but the studio believed one final fling for GWTW was possible. The film returned to movie theaters for the third time in the spring of 1942 and stayed in release until late 1943 ... When MGM finally pulled the film from exhibition, all worn-out prints were destroyed, and GWTW was at last declared out of circulation.

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32\u00a0million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Variety* still had *The Birth of a Nation* ahead of *The Big Parade* ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals and\u2014if its estimate is correct\u2014*Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* ($8,500,000)[67] would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record;[68] although it would have been the highest-grossing 'talkie',[69] displacing *The Singing Fool* ($5,900,000).[70] Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely *The Birth of a Nation* was ever overtaken by a silent-era film,[71] the record would fall to 1925's *Ben-Hur* ($9,386,000) if *The Birth of a Nation* earned significantly less than its estimated gross.[72] In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, *The Birth of a Nation* played at a large number of private, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"All Time Worldwide Box Office\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The total listed here incorporates subsequent earnings in Japan, Nigeria, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany up to the end of 2015 but omits earnings in Turkey, Iceland, Brazil, and Australia (2016), which amount to a few hundred thousand dollars. The total is rounded to $1\u00a0million to compensate for the numerical inaccuracy.

Distributor rentals: It is also important to know and recognize the difference between the distributor's gross receipts and the gross rentals. The term \"rentals\" refers to the aggregate amount of the film distributor's share of monies paid at theatre box offices computed on the basis of negotiated agreements between the distributor and the exhibitor. Note that gross receipts refers to amounts actually received and from all markets and media, whereas gross rentals refers to amounts earned from theatrical exhibition only, regardless of whether received by the distributor. Thus, gross receipts is the much broader term and includes distributor rentals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Block, Hayley Taylor (2010), *The Jazz Singer*, p.\u00a0113, The film brought in $2.6\u00a0million in worldwide rentals and made a net profit of $1,196,750.

Since it's rarely seen today, *The Singing Fool* is frequently confused with *The Jazz Singer*; although besides Jolson and a pervasively maudlin air the two have little in common. In the earlier film Jolson was inordinately attached to his mother and sang \"Mammy\"; here the fixation was on his young son, and \"Sonny Boy\" became an enormous hit. So did the film, which amassed a stunning world-wide gross of $5.9\u00a0million...Some sources give it as the highest gross of *any* film in its initial release prior to *Gone with the Wind*. This is probably overstating it\u2014MGM's records show that *Ben-Hur* and *The Big Parade* grossed more, and no one knows just how much *The Birth of a Nation* brought in.

It stars an ensemble cast that consists of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, and Harvey Fierstein. The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by a powerful extraterrestrial race. With the other people of the world, they launch a counterattack on July 4\u2014Independence Day in the United States.\n\n\nWhile promoting *Stargate* in Europe, Emmerich conceived the film while answering a question about his belief in the existence of alien life. Devlin and Emmerich decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began on July 28, 1995, in New York City, and the film was completed on October 8, 1995.\n\n\nConsidered a significant turning point in the history of the Hollywood blockbuster, *Independence Day* was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. It was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in original release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, musical score and visual effects, but criticism for its characters. It grossed over $817.4\u00a0million worldwide,[2] becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996 and the second-highest-grossing film ever at the time, behind *Jurassic Park* (1993). The film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.[4]\n\n\nThe sequel, *Independence Day: Resurgence*, was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, as part of a planned series of films.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOn July 2, 1996, an extraterrestrial mothership enters Earth's orbit and deploys saucers (each 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) in diameter) over major cities worldwide, including New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\n\nU.S. Marine Captain Steven Hiller and his unit, the Black Knights fighter squadron out of MCAS El Toro, are called back from fourth of July leave to defend Los Angeles; his girlfriend, Jasmine Dubrow, decides to flee the city with her son, Dylan. Retired combat pilot Russell Casse, now an alcoholic single father and crop duster, sees this as vindication of the alien abduction he has been claiming for years. In New York City, technician David Levinson decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David and his father Julius reach the Oval Office and alert President Thomas Whitmore.\n\n\nWhitmore orders evacuations of the targeted cities in the U.S., but it's too late. Each saucer fires a beam, incinerating every targeted city, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others escape aboard Air Force One while Jasmine, Dylan, and their dog Boomer take shelter in a tunnel's inspection alcove, emerging once the destruction is over.\n\n\nOn July 3, counterattacks against the invaders are thwarted by the alien warships' force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of shielded fighters which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases, including Captain Hiller's. Hiller lures an enemy fighter into the Grand Canyon before ejecting from his plane, blinding the fighter using his parachute and causing the alien to crash in the Mojave Desert. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, transporting the alien to Area 51, where Whitmore's group in Air Force One has landed.\n\n\nDefense Secretary Albert Nimzicki reveals that a government faction has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947 when one of the invaders' fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished ship and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As chief scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it awakens, telepathically invades Okun's mind and launches a psychic attack against Whitmore before being killed by Secret Service agents and military personnel. Whitmore reveals what he learned when they linked: the invaders' plan to annihilate Earth's inhabitants and harvest its natural resources, as they have already done to other planetary civilizations.\n\n\nWhitmore reluctantly authorizes a trial nuclear attack against a saucer above Houston, but the ship is unharmed (with the city destroyed from the blast), and all subsequent nuclear attacks are aborted. Jasmine and Dylan commandeer a highway maintenance truck and rescue a handful of survivors, including the critically injured First Lady Marilyn Whitmore. Though Hiller rescues them and takes them to Area 51, Marilyn's injuries are too severe, and she dies after reuniting with her family.\n\n\nOn July 4, taking inspiration from his father, David writes a computer virus from his laptop to disrupt the aliens' shields' operating system, and devises a plan to upload it into the mothership from the refurbished alien fighter, which Hiller volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through Morse code to organize a united counter-offensive. Lacking pilots, Whitmore and General William Grey enlist volunteers with flight experience, including Russell Casse, from the refugee camp at the base to fly the remaining jets at Area 51; Whitmore leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base, overseen by Grey.\n\n\nHiller marries Jasmine with David and Constance in attendance before leaving on the mission. Entering the mothership, they upload the virus and deploy a nuclear missile, destroying it and the aliens' invasion forces. With the shields deactivated, Whitmore's squadron engages the fighters, but exhausts their ammunition before managing to destroy the saucer. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell sacrifices himself by crashing into the saucer's primary weapon before it fires, destroying the warship. Grey then orders notifications to the resistance groups worldwide of the spaceships' critical weakness and they destroy the others. As humanity rejoices, Hiller and Levinson reunite with their families.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller, a Marine F/A-18 pilot with the Black Knight squadron at MCAS El Toro and aspiring astronaut. The role was originally offered to Ethan Hawke but he turned it down as he thought the script was terrible.[5] Devlin and Emmerich had always envisioned an African-American for the role,[6] and specifically wanted Smith after seeing his performance in *Six Degrees of Separation*.[7]\n* Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore, a former fighter pilot and Gulf War veteran. To prepare for the role, Pullman read Bob Woodward's *The Commanders* and watched the documentary film *The War Room*.[8]\n* Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, an MIT-educated satellite engineer and technological expert.\n* Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore, the wife of Thomas Whitmore, who was severely injured in a helicopter crash.\n* Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson, David Levinson's father. The character was based on one of Dean Devlin's uncles.[9]\n* Robert Loggia as General William Grey, USMC, the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Loggia modeled the character after World War II generals, particularly George S. Patton.[10]\n* Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, an eccentric, alcoholic former fighter pilot and Vietnam War veteran. He insists that he was abducted by the aliens during work on aerial application ten years prior to the film's events, shortly after completing his military service.\n* Margaret Colin as Constance Spano, Whitmore's White House Communications Director and David Levinson's ex-wife.\n* Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow, Steven Hiller's girlfriend and mother of Dylan Dubrow.\n* James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, the Secretary of Defense and, as former CIA Director, is a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence due to the ship recovered at Roswell. Not well-liked, lying, arrogant, selfish, crooked, and often at odds with idealists such as Whitmore and Grey, Nimzicki embodies the stereotypical corrupt politician and his ambition is to be elected as president himself. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North.[11] The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki,[12] MGM's head of advertising, who made life unpleasant for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of *Stargate*.[13]\n* Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert, David Levinson's coworker at Compact Cable Television Company, killed in the NYC attack.\n* Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell, USAF, Area 51's commanding officer and thus a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence. During the interstellar war, he becomes a trusted ally to Thomas Whitmore's party.\n* Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun, the unkempt and highly excitable scientist in charge of research at Area 51. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on *Stargate*.[14]\n* James Duval as Miguel Casse, the oldest son of Russell Casse.\n* Bill Smitrovich as Lt. Colonel Watson, the commanding officer of the Black Knights.\n* Kiersten Warren as Tiffani, friend and co-worker of Jasmine, killed in the LA attack.\n* Harry Connick Jr. as Marine Captain Jimmy Wilder, fellow fighter pilot and friend of Steven, killed in the Black Knight counterattack. Connick took over the role from Matthew Perry who was originally cast in the role.\n* Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore, the daughter of President Thomas J. Whitmore and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore.[15]\n* Ross Bagley as Dylan Dubrow, Jasmine Dubrow's son and Steven Hiller's stepson.\n* Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, the daughter of Russell Casse.\n* Giuseppe Andrews as Troy Casse, the son of Russell Casse.\n* Frank Welker as special vocal effects.\n* Gary Hecker as alien vocal effects.\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official film logo\nThe idea for the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe promoting their film *Stargate*. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like *Stargate* if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15-mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, \"I think I have an idea for our next film.\"[9][16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)F/A-18 Hornets of VMFA-314, \"Black Knights\"\nEmmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that \"for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field \u2026[o]r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head.\"[18] Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy, \"would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance?\"[18] The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico,[16] and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, 20th Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin greenlit the screenplay.[13] Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995.[9][16] The U.S. military originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's Area 51 references.[9]\n\n\nA then-record 3,000-plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film.[17] The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than computer-generated effects in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results.[9] Many of these shots were accomplished at Hughes Aircraft in Culver City, California, where the film's art department, motion control photography teams, pyrotechnics team, and model shop were headquartered[*dubious \u2013 discuss*]. The production's model-making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments.[19] The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) destroyer model[20] and a version of the mother ship spanning 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m).[21] City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards. An explosion would be ignited below the model, and flames would rise towards the camera, engulfing the tilted model and creating the rolling \"wall of destruction\" look seen in the film.[22] A model of the White House was also created, covering 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) by 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m), and was used in forced-perspective shots before being destroyed in a similar fashion for its destruction scene.[23] The detonation took a week to plan[13] and required 40 explosive charges.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)A World War II training aircraft with a camera mounted on its front navigated through the walls of the Little Colorado River canyon, and the footage was used as pilot point-of-view shots.[24]\nThe film's aliens were designed by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos. The actual aliens in the film are diminutive and based on a design Tatopoulos drew when tasked by Emmerich to create an alien that was \"both familiar and completely original\".[25] These creatures wear \"bio-mechanical\" suits that are based on another design Tatopoulos pitched to Emmerich. These suits were 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) tall, equipped with 25 tentacles, and purposely designed to show it could not sustain a person inside so it would not appear to be a \"man in a suit\".[26]\n\n\nChristopher Weaver, founder of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks consulted with the movie's production team, Centropolis Films, and provided scientific collaboration.[27] Dean Devlin used Weaver as the basis for the film character David Levinson.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 28, 1995, in New York City. A second unit gathered plate shots and establishing shots of Manhattan, Washington, D.C., an RV community in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Very Large Array on the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico.[26] The main crew also filmed in nearby Cliffside Park, New Jersey before moving to the former Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, California to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.[29] The production then moved to Wendover, Utah, and West Wendover, Nevada,[30] where the deserts doubled for Imperial Valley, and the Wendover Airport doubled for the El Toro and Area 51 exteriors.[31] It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title because of a film from 1983 which is also called *Independence Day*. Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in dailies, the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.[9] Pullman had stated in a 2020 interview that Fox had otherwise been aiming to use *Doomsday* for the film's release to match with other disaster films of the time, and Devlin and Emmerich had hoped the impact of this speech scene would help win Fox over to the *Independence Day* name.[32] The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.[13]\n\n\nThe production team moved to the Bonneville Salt Flats to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the chroma key technique to make it appear as if an activity was happening on the other side of the glass, but the composited images were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".[33] The attacker hangar set contained an attacker mockup 65 feet (20\u00a0m) wide[19] that took four months to build.[13] The White House interior sets used had already been built for *The American President* and had previously been used for *Nixon*.[23] Principal photography completed on October 8, 1995, after 72 days of filming.\n\n\nThe film initially depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.[9] However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,[9] and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day (soundtrack)\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning[34] score for the film was composed by David Arnold and recorded with an orchestra of 90, a choir of 46, \"and every last ounce of stereotypical Americana he could muster for the occasion\".[35] The film's producer Dean Devlin commented that \"you can leave it up to a Brit to write some of the most rousing and patriotic music in the history of American cinema.\"[35] The soundtrack has received two official CD releases. RCA released a 50-minute album at the time of the film's release, then in 2010, La-La Land Records released a limited-edition, two-disc CD set that comprised the complete score plus 12 alternate cues.[36] The premiere of *Independence Day* live took place at the Royal Albert Hall in September 2016, with the film's score performed live for a screening of the film.[37] This celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the film's release, and the event also featured a pre-film talk by David Arnold.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Time capsule in Rachel, Nevada.\nWhile *Independence Day* was still in post-production, Fox began an expensive marketing campaign to help promote the film, beginning with the airing of a dramatic commercial during Super Bowl XXX, for which it paid $1.3\u00a0million.[38] The film's subsequent success at the box office resulted in a trend of using Super Bowl air time to begin the advertising campaigns for potential blockbusters.[39][40]\n\n\nFox's Licensing and Merchandising division also entered into co-promotional deals with Apple Inc. The co-marketing project was dubbed \"The Power to Save the World\" campaign, in which the company used footage of David using his PowerBook 5300 laptop in their print and television advertisements.[41] Trendmasters entered a merchandising deal with the film's producers to create a line of tie-in toys.[42] In exchange for product placement, Fox also entered into co-promotional deals with Molson Coors Brewing Company and Coca-Cola.[43]\n\n\nThe film was marketed with several taglines, including: \"We've always believed we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll wish we were\", \"Earth. Take a good look. It could be your last\", and \"Don't make plans for August\". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third of which was a spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as \"truly brilliant\".[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The shot of the White House's destruction was the focus of the film's marketing campaign. A fleeing helicopter was added to the shot in the final print.\nThe film had its official premiere held at Los Angeles' now-defunct Mann Plaza Theater on June 25, 1996.[45] It was then screened privately at the White House for President Bill Clinton and his family[46] before receiving a nationwide release in the United States on July 2, 1996, a day earlier than its previously scheduled opening.[47]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn Lebanon, certain Jewish- and Israel-related content in the film was censored. One cut scene involved Judd Hirsch's character donning a kippah, and leading soldiers and White House officials in a Jewish prayer. Other removed footage showed Israeli and Arab troops working together in preparation for countering the alien invasion. The Lebanese Shi'a Islamist militant group Hezbollah called for Muslims to boycott the film, describing it as \"propaganda for the so-called genius of the Jews and their concern for humanity.\" In response, Jewish actor Jeff Goldblum said: \"I think Hezbollah has missed the point. The film is not about American Jews saving the world; it's about teamwork among people of different religions and nationalities to defeat a common enemy.\"[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nAfter a six-week, $30\u00a0million marketing campaign, *Independence Day* was released on a THX certified VHS on November 22, 1996.[50] A LaserDisc release came out at roughly the same time, which included audio commentary, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes, and a bundled soundtrack CD.[51] The film sold 22 million copies in North America, becoming the best selling live-action video.[52]\n\n\nThe film became available on DVD on June 27, 2000, and has since been re-released in several different versions of this format with varying supplemental material, including one instance where it was packaged with a lenticular cover.[53][54] A special edition of the film was included on the DVD as well, which features nine minutes of additional footage not seen in the original theatrical release.[53][55] A single-disc DVD version of the film was released alongside *Cast Away* on May 21, 2002.[56] *Independence Day* became available on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on December 24, 2007,[57] and in North America on March 11, 2008[58] and in Australia on March 5, 2008.[59] The initial single-disc releases only feature the theatrical cut and a few extras, as per the single-disc DVDs. For its 2016 twentieth anniversary, the film was re-released on two-disc Blu-ray and DVD, 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, and Digital HD.[60][61] The 20th-anniversary editions feature both the theatrical and extended versions,[62] all the extras of the previous 2-disc DVDs and more.[63]\n\n\n\n### Television broadcast[edit]\n\n\n*Independence Day* was originally scheduled to air on Fox on September 16, 2001, but was cancelled following the September 11 attacks. The network replaced *Independence Day* with a repeat airing of *There's Something About Mary*.[64]\n\n\n\n### Re-release[edit]\n\n\nThe film had both its twentieth anniversary and premiere at a special live-orchestral screening performance at the Royal Albert Hall on September 22, 2016. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the original orchestrator Nicholas Dodd, performed the score live during the film, and the film's composer, David Arnold, was a presenter at the event.[65][37]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the film's creatures on the cover of the July 1, 1996 issue of *Time*.\n*Independence Day* was the highest-grossing film of 1996, surpassing both *Twister* and *Mission: Impossible*.[2] The film had its preview screenings on July 2, 1996, grossing $11.1 million from 2,433 theaters. At that point, it had the biggest pre-opening of any film, breaking the six-year record held by *Die Hard 2*. The next day on July 3, the film officially opened to the public with $17.4 million.[66] During its second day of release, it earned $17.3 million, which made it the highest Thursday gross, holding this record for six years until it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones* in 2002.[67] This was also the highest non-sequel Thursday gross, which would last until the opening of *Transformers* in 2007.[68] *Independence Day* earned $104.3\u00a0million in its opening week,[69] including $96.1\u00a0million during its five-day holiday opening, and $50.2\u00a0million during its opening weekend.[70] The film stayed in the number-one spot for three consecutive weeks before being displaced by *A Time to Kill*.[71][2] Moreover, it beat *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*'s record for largest five-day Wednesday gross of any film, as well as the biggest July opening weekend.[72] The combined total for the five-day Wednesday opening increased to $190 million, dethroning the $158.6 million record held by *Toy Story*.[73] In addition, the film had the second-highest opening weekend of any movie, behind *Batman Forever*.[74] All three figures broke records set by *Jurassic Park* three years earlier,[69] whose successor, *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*, claimed all three records when it was released in 1997.[75] That same year, *Men in Black* surpassed *Independence Day* for highest July opening weekend and largest three-day Fourth of July opening weekend.[76] Despite this, the film would continue to hold the record for having the highest five-day Fourth of July Wednesday opening until *Men in Black II* in 2002.[77]\n\n\n*Independence Day* earned over $150 million in 12 days, becoming the quickest film to do so.[78] In 21 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $200 million mark.[79] The film would hold this record for three years until it was surpassed by *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace* in 1999.[80] By the end of July 1996, *Independence Day* had lost 38% of its audience, but it was able to top *Ghostbusters*, *Aladdin*, *Mrs. Doubtfire* and *Ghost*, becoming the fourteenth-highest domestic grossing film of all time.[81] It reached $230 million within the first month of release,[82] and on August 9, crossed the $250 million mark.[83] Halfway through the month, it became the eighth-highest domestic grosser, beating *Jaws*.[84]\n\n\n*Independence Day* grossed $306,169,268 in the United States and Canada and $511,231,623 in other territories during its theatrical run.[2] The combined worldwide total of $817,400,891 surpassed *The Lion King*, second only to the worldwide earnings of *Jurassic Park* as the highest of all time.[85][86][87] For over 20 years, the film would hold the record for being the highest-grossing film starring Will Smith until 2019 when it was surpassed by the live-action version of *Aladdin*.[88] The domestic record was beaten by *Suicide Squad* three years earlier in 2016.[89] In the UK, the film grossed \u00a37,005,905 in its opening weekend (including \u00a3939,022 from previews), surpassing *Jurassic Park*'s record of \u00a34.9 million.[90] The film grossed a record $10.5\u00a0million in its opening weekend in Germany and also beat the opening record in France.[91][92] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 69.26\u00a0million tickets in the US and Canada.[93] Hoping to capitalize on the film's success, several studios released large-scale disaster films,[94] and the already rising interest in science fiction-related media was further increased by the film's popularity.[46]\n\n\nA month after the film's release, jewelry designers and marketing consultants reported an increased interest in dolphin-themed jewelry, as the character Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) wears dolphin earrings, and is presented with a wedding ring featuring a gold dolphin.[95]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 67% of 79 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The plot is thin and so is character development, but as a thrilling, spectacle-filled summer movie, *Independence Day* delivers.\"[96] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[97] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[98]\n\n\nCritics wrote that the film has \"cardboard\" and \"stereotypical\" characters,[6][47][99][100][101] and weak dialogue.[94][101][102][103] However, the shot of the White House's destruction has been declared a milestone in visual effects and one of the most memorable scenes of the 1990s.[104][105] In a 2010 poll, readers of *Entertainment Weekly* rated it the second-greatest summer film of the previous 20 years, ranking only behind *Jurassic Park*.[106]\n\n\nMick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* gave the film his highest rating, declaring it the \"apotheosis\" of comic book space adventure movies.[47] Lisa Schwarzbaum of *Entertainment Weekly* gave it a B+ for living up to its massive hype, adding \"charm is the foremost of this epic's contemporary characteristics. The script is witty, knowing, cool.\"[100] Eight years later, *Entertainment Weekly* would rate the film as one of the best disaster films of all time.[94] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* felt that the film did an \"excellent job conveying the boggling immensity of [the] extraterrestrial vehicles [\u2026] and panic in the streets\" and the scenes of the alien attack were \"disturbing, unsettling and completely convincing\".[6]\n\n\nHowever, the film's nationalistic overtones were widely criticized by reviewers outside the U.S. *Movie Review UK* described the film as \"a mish-mash of elements from a wide variety of alien invasion movies and gung-ho American jingoism.\"[107] The speech during which Whitmore states that victory in the coming war would see the entire world henceforth describe July 4 as its Independence Day, was described in a BBC review as \"the most jaw-droppingly pompous soliloquy ever delivered in a mainstream Hollywood movie.\"[108] In 2003, readers of *Empire* voted the scene that contained this speech as the \"Cheesiest Movie Moment of All-Time\".[109] Conversely, *Empire* critic Kim Newman gave the film a five-star rating in the magazine's original review of the film.[97]\n\n\nSeveral critics expressed disappointment with the quality of the film's special effects. *Newsweek*'s David Ansen claimed the special effects were of no better caliber than those seen nineteen years earlier in *Star Wars*.[101] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* felt the production's budget-conscious approach resulted in \"cheesy\" shots that lacked in quality relative to the effects present in films directed by James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.[45] In his review, Roger Ebert took note of a lack of imagination in the spaceship and creature designs.[110] Gene Siskel expressed the same sentiments in his *At the Movies* review of the film.*[44][*dead link*]*\n\n\n**American Film Institute lists**\n\n\n\n* AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills \u2013 Nominated[111]\n* AFI's 10 Top 10 \u2013 Nominated Science Fiction Film[112]\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Subject\n | Nominee\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CAS Awards[113] | Best Sound\n | Chris Carpenter, Bob Beemer, Bill W.

With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed, such as *Dante's Peak* and *Volcano* (both in 1997), as well as *Deep Impact* and *Armageddon* (both in 1998). The trend resumed from the mid-2000s to 2010s, evident in three of Emmerich's films titled *The Day After Tomorrow* (2004), *2012* (2009), and *White House Down* (2013), as well as other blockbusters like *Transformers* (2007) and *The Avengers* (2012).[117]\n\n\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day (book series)\n\nAuthor Stephen Molstad wrote a tie-in novel to help promote the film shortly before its release. The novel goes into further detail on the characters, situations, and overall concepts not explored in the film. The novel presents the film's finale as originally scripted, with the character played by Randy Quaid stealing a missile and roping it to his cropduster biplane.\n\n\nFollowing the film's success, a prequel novel entitled *Independence Day: Silent Zone* was written by Molstad in February 1998.[118] The novel is set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and details the early career of Dr. Brackish Okun.[119]\n\n\nMolstad wrote a third novel, *Independence Day: War in the Desert* in July 1999. Set in Saudi Arabia on July 3, it centers around Captain Cummins and Colonel Thompson, the two Royal Air Force officers seen receiving the Morse code message in the film (Americanised ranks corrected to Squadron Leader and Group Captain respectively in the Omnibus reissue).\nA Marvel comic book was also written based on the first two novelizations.\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nOn August 4, 1996, BBC Radio 1 broadcast the one-hour play *Independence Day UK*, written, produced, and directed by Dirk Maggs, a spin-off depicting the alien invasion from a British perspective.[120] None of the original cast was present. Dean Devlin gave Maggs permission to produce an original version, on the condition that he did not reveal certain details of the movie's plot, and that the British were not depicted as saving the day.[120] *Independence Day UK* was set up to be similar to the 1938 radio broadcast of *The War of the Worlds\u2014*the first 20 minutes were live.[120]\n\n\n\n### Multimedia[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996 a \"behind-the-scenes\" multimedia CD-ROM titled *Inside Independence Day* was released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh; it includes storyboards for the film, sketches, movie clips, and a preview of the *Independence Day* video game.[121]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nAn *Independence Day* video game was released in February 1997 for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC, each version receiving mostly tepid reviews.[122] The multi-view shooter game contains various missions to perform, with the ultimate goal of destroying the aliens' primary weapon. A pinball machine themed to the film was released by Sega in June 1996.[123] Plus, a wireless mobile version was released in 2005. A video game entitled *ID4 Online* was released in 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Toys[edit]\n\n\nTrendmasters released a toy line for the film in 1996.[124] Each action figure, vehicle or playset came with a 3+1\u20442 inch floppy disk that contained an interactive computer game.[125]\n\n\n\n## Franchise[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day: Resurgence\n\nIn June 2011, Devlin confirmed that he and Emmerich had written a treatment for two sequels to form a trilogy; both expressed the desire for Will Smith to return.[126] In October 2011, however, discussions over Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50\u00a0million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.[127]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Emmerich stated that the titles of the new films would be *ID: Forever \u2013 Part I* and *ID: Forever \u2013 Part II*.[128] In November 2014, the sequel was given the green light by 20th Century Fox, with a release date of June 24, 2016. This would be a stand-alone sequel, that would not split into two parts as originally planned, with filming beginning in May 2015 and casting being done after the studio locked down Emmerich as the director of the film.[129] In December 2014, Devlin confirmed that Emmerich would indeed be directing the sequel.[130] On June 22, 2015, Emmerich announced the official title, *Independence Day: Resurgence*.[131]\n\n\nWith respect to Smith's decision not to return to film a sequel, Emmerich told Screen Crush that: \"In the very beginning, I wanted to work with him and he was excited to be in it but then after a while he was tired of sequels, and he did another science fiction film, which was his father-son story *After Earth*, so he opted out.\"[132]\n\n\n*Independence Day: Resurgence* was released on June 24, 2016.[133] The sequel, unlike the original, was both a critical and commercial failure, making further sequels unlikely. Furthermore, in March 2018, LRM Online reported that, after having met producer Dean Devlin at WonderCon and asking about the status of *Independence Day 3*, Devlin told them \"I don't know. I don't know. Currently, I personally have no plans of doing another one.\"[134][135] One year later, Emmerich stated that once The Walt Disney Company purchased Fox he thought the chances of a third movie were over, but still had hopes that the project could happen given Disney's preference for franchise films.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Independence Day* (book series)\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* Apollo 11 in popular culture\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*INDEPENDENCE DAY* (12)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules\u2014especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year\u2014and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Original release: \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. **^** \"All Time Worldwide Box Office\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Essentially belonging to the exploitation genre, it was marketed as an educational sex hygiene film in an effort to circumvent censorship laws. Falling foul of the Motion Picture Production Code, *Mom and Dad* was prevented from obtaining mainstream distribution and restricted to independent and drive-in theaters. It was the biggest hit of its kind, and remained in continual distribution until the 1970s when hardcore pornography eventually took over. At the end of 1947 it had earned $2\u00a0million, and by 1949, $8\u00a0million; by 1956 it had earned $22\u00a0million in rentals, representing a gross of $80\u00a0million, and would have easily placed in the top ten films in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Estimates of its total earnings are as high as $100\u00a0million.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount.[83] Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976\u2014about four years into the film's release\u2014showed the film had grossed over $25\u00a0million.[84] Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600\u00a0million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box-office receipts for the film.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000\u20138,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000\u20139,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Hawaii* | $34,562,222\\* ($15,600,000)\\*R | $15,000,000 | [# 221][# 154] |\n| *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* | $33,736,689\\* ($14,500,000)\\*R | $7,613,000 | [# 222][# 154][# 223] |\n| 1967 | *The Jungle Book* | $378,000,000 ($23,800,000)R | $3,900,000\u20134,000,000 | [# 194][# 224][# 225][# 146] |\n| *The Graduate* | $85,000,000R | $3,100,000 | [# 226][# 227] |\n| 1968 | *2001: A Space Odyssey* | $141,000,000\u2013190,000,000($21,900,000)R | $10,300,000 | [# 228][# 210] |\n| *Funny Girl* | $80,000,000\u2013100,000,000 | $8,800,000 | [# 229][# 230] |\n| 1969 | *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* | $152,308,525 ($37,100,000)R | $6,600,000 | [# 231][# 210][# 227] |\n| 1970 | *Love Story* | $173,400,000 ($80,000,000)R | $2,260,000 | [# 232][# 233][# 234] |\n| 1971 | *The French Connection* | $75,000,000R | $3,300,000 | [# 109] |\n| *Fiddler on the Roof* | $49,400,000R  ($100,000,000/$45,100,000R)\n | $9,000,000 | [# 235][# 236] |\n| *Diamonds Are Forever* | $116,000,000 ($45,700,000)R | $7,200,000 | [# 214][# 215] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Total: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Other sources put its earnings at $2\u00a0million,[55] which may suggest the higher figure is the worldwide rental, given the confusion over international figures during this period.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *The Red Shoes* | $5,000,000\\*R | \u00a3505,581 (~$2,000,000)\n | [# 154][# 168][# 169] |\n| *The Snake Pit* | $4,100,000\\*R | $3,800,000 | [# 170][# 171] |\n| 1949 | *Samson and Delilah* | $14,209,250R | $3,097,563 | [# 172][# 97] |\n| 1950 | *Cinderella* | $263,591,415($20,000,000/$7,800,000R)\n | $2,200,000 | [# 173][# 174][# 175] |\n| *King Solomon's Mines* | $10,050,000R | $2,258,000 | [# 176] |\n| 1951 | *Quo Vadis* | $21,037,000\u201326,700,000R | $7,623,000 | [# 172][# 177][# 178] |\n| 1952 | *This Is Cinerama* | $50,000,000CI | $1,000,000 | [# 179][# 180] |\n| *The Greatest Show on Earth* | $18,350,000R GS | $3,873,946 | [# 181][# 182][# 97] |\n| 1953 | *Peter Pan* | $145,000,000 ($7,000,000)\\*R | $3,000,000\u20134,000,000 | [# 183][# 184] |\n| *The Robe* | $25,000,000\u201326,100,000R | $4,100,000 | [# 185][# 186][# 178] |\n| 1954 | *Rear Window* | $24,500,000\\* ($5,300,000)\\*R | $1,000,000 | [# 187][# 177] |\n| *White Christmas* | $26,000,050\\* ($12,000,000)\\*R | $3,800,000 | [# 188][# 189][# 190] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7\u00a0billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3\u00a0billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n224. **^** \"Animals Portray Parts in Disney's \"Robin Hood\"\". *Toledo Blade*.

One notable example of this phenomenon is *Avatar*, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films.[25] Social and economic factors such as population change[26] and the growth of international markets[27][28][29] also have an effect on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Black Panther (2018)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The Birth of a Nation, costing an unprecedented and, many believed, thoroughly foolhardy $110,000, eventually returned $20\u00a0million and more. The actual figure is hard to calculate because the film was distributed on a \"states' rights\" basis in which licenses to show the film were sold outright. The actual cash generated by The Birth of a Nation may have been as much as $50\u00a0million to $100\u00a0million, an almost inconceivable amount for such an early film.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cones, John W.

Distributor rentals: It is also important to know and recognize the difference between the distributor's gross receipts and the gross rentals. The term \"rentals\" refers to the aggregate amount of the film distributor's share of monies paid at theatre box offices computed on the basis of negotiated agreements between the distributor and the exhibitor. Note that gross receipts refers to amounts actually received and from all markets and media, whereas gross rentals refers to amounts earned from theatrical exhibition only, regardless of whether received by the distributor. Thus, gross receipts is the much broader term and includes distributor rentals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Main series | $3,059,525,837\n | 7\n | $437,075,120\n | *Days of Future Past* ($746,045,700)\n |\n| 1\n | *Days of Future Past* (2014) | $746,045,700 |\n| 2\n | *Apocalypse* (2016) | $543,934,105 |\n| 3\n | *The Last Stand* (2006) | $460,435,291 |\n| 4\n | *X2* (2003) | $407,711,549 |\n| 5\n | *First Class* (2011) | $352,616,690 |\n| 6\n | *X-Men* (2000) | $296,339,528 |\n| 7\n | *Dark Phoenix* (2019) | $252,442,974\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Deadpool *series** | $1,568,508,764\n | 2\n | $784,254,382\n | *Deadpool 2* ($785,896,609)\n |\n| 1\n | *Deadpool 2* (2018) | $785,896,609 |\n| 2\n | *Deadpool* (2016) | $782,612,155\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Wolverine *series** | $1,406,912,546\n | 3\n | $468,970,849\n | *Logan* ($619,021,436)\n |\n| 1\n | *Logan* (2017) | $619,021,436 |\n| 2\n | *The Wolverine* (2013) | $414,828,246 |\n| 3\n | *Origins: Wolverine* (2009) | $373,062,864\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Block, Hayley Taylor (2010), *The Jazz Singer*, p.\u00a0113, The film brought in $2.6\u00a0million in worldwide rentals and made a net profit of $1,196,750.

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32\u00a0million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** \"How 'Spectre' May Stack Up With 'Thunderball' as a James Bond Blockbuster\". *The New York Times*.

Since it's rarely seen today, *The Singing Fool* is frequently confused with *The Jazz Singer*; although besides Jolson and a pervasively maudlin air the two have little in common. In the earlier film Jolson was inordinately attached to his mother and sang \"Mammy\"; here the fixation was on his young son, and \"Sonny Boy\" became an enormous hit. So did the film, which amassed a stunning world-wide gross of $5.9\u00a0million...Some sources give it as the highest gross of *any* film in its initial release prior to *Gone with the Wind*. This is probably overstating it\u2014MGM's records show that *Ben-Hur* and *The Big Parade* grossed more, and no one knows just how much *The Birth of a Nation* brought in. Still, by the standards of the time it's an amazing amount.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnimated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era.

It earned Amrapurkar a Best Villain nomination at the 43rd Filmfare Awards. The film was remade in Kannada as *Snehana Preethina* (2007).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nRanjit Rai and Harbans Lal Saxena are two wealthy businessmen who despise the poor. However, Ranjit's son Ajay meets with his childhood friend Raja, a poor mechanic; while Harbans's daughter, Madhu is good friends with Kajal, who is also poor. They fix up Ajay's marriage with Madhu by getting their signatures on a marriage certificate by deceit and without their knowledge; and send Ajay to meet Madhu at Harbans's place in Ooty. As fate would have it, Kajal and Raja follow them, resulting in Ajay falling in love with Kajal instead and Raja falling in love with Madhu. This angers the two fathers, who try to bribe Raja and Kajal into leaving Madhu and Ajay. When this doesn't work, they try to get Raja and Kajal killed. When the children realize what their fathers really did, they refuse to back down.\n\n\nEventually, the parents play a nasty trick, by making the four lovers believe that they have changed their ways and are ready for their children to marry the person they wish to. On the way to Raja and Madhu's engagement ceremony, Kajal gets kidnapped. Raja saves her from being raped and comforts her. Meanwhile, without their knowledge, photos are taken of them. The fathers then show the photos of Raja comforting Kajal at the party. Taken out of context, the photos make it look like Raja and Kajal are being intimate with each other. Kajal's uncle also testifies to an alleged illicit affair between the two. Raja and Kajal try to prove their innocence, but Ajay and Madhu, refusing to listen to them, break up with Kajal and Raja, and the fathers' plan succeed.\n\n\nThe situation worsens further when Ajay and Madhu think that Kajal is pregnant with Raja's child. They tell Raja and Kajal that they are getting married, which is what their fathers wanted all along. After hearing this, Kajal attempts to kill herself, but Raja stops her. Intending to teach Ajay and Madhu a lesson, Raja attacks them while they are in a car. Raja pretends to show that he is about to rape Madhu, but Ajay saves and comforts her. Raja is beaten brutally while in police custody, and Kajal pleads with the fathers to release him. The fathers agree, but on the condition that Kajal and Raja leave the country for good and that they would be killed if they ever did return. Kajal agrees and Raja is set free.\n\n\nAjay and Madhu's wedding is about to start when Ajay's uncle, Lambodar, shows them pictures of Ajay comforting Madhu after she almost got raped. This proves that Raja had attacked them to recreate the situation he and Kajal had been in, which in turn proved that Raja and Kajal are innocent and that the fathers were behind the initial attack on Kajal. Further proving the innocence of both Raja and Kajal after Lambodar reveals his knowledge of Raja saving Kajal from being raped, he and another friend beat and drag in Kajal's uncle who confesses that he lied and was paid by Raja's father to do so. Angry and heartbroken, Ajay almost chokes his father to death, but his conscience stops him. Feeling guilty, he then tries to kill himself, but Madhu and Lambodar stop him. Ajay and Madhu after learning that Kajal and Raja are about to leave the country, rush to the shipyard and succeed in stopping Raja and Kajal from leaving the country on the ship. They ask for forgiveness and the lovers get back together. They then get to know that Ranjit delayed the ship's departure by half an hour, allowing Ajay and Madhu to meet their partners. The fathers arrive, having realized their grave mistake, and also ask for forgiveness, declaring their discovery of how poor they are in spite of wealth and that their real wealth is their children. The lovers forgive them and everyone is reunited.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Aamir Khan as Raja Ahlawat\n* Ajay Devgn as Ajay Rai\n* Kajol as Kajal Sharma\n* Juhi Chawla as Madhu Saxena\n* \n* Johnny Lever as Lambodar Upadhyay\n* Sadashiv Amrapurkar as Ranjit Rai\n* Dalip Tahil as Harbans Lal Saxena\n* Mohan Joshi as Madan Jindal\n* Tiku Talsania as Pankaj Gaitonde\n* Anant Mahadevan as Brijesh Lal Saxena\n* Yunus Parvez as Parsi baba\n* Razzak Khan as Nawaab naadin Dhinna Change\n* Deepak Shirke as Damliya Kutta\n* Deven Verma as Behram\n* Ghanashyam Nayak as ACP Balram Gulati IPS\n* Shwetha Menon as Jia in song \"Humko Tumse Pyar Hai\"\n* Achyut Potdar as Barrister Chandra Shekhar Gokhale\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Later, Boney Kapoor asked Kumar to make the film with Sanjay Kapoor and Vivek Mushran playing the roles of Ajay and Raja, respectively. However, Kumar had no happiness to cast the two, and he then made the film *Raja* (1995) with Sanjay Kapoor, which released in 1995. He again came with the idea of making *Ishq* in 1996 and selected Aamir Khan, Ajay Devgn, Juhi Chawla and Kajol to play the leads.\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nKarisma Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit were offered the roles of Kajol and Juhi Chawla, respectively, but the former declined to work opposite Devgan and the latter had date issues. Along with this, Amitabh Bachchan was signed to play the role of a man who after completing an intermission tries to unite the four lovers, but due to some problems with Kumar, he left the film, and Kumar later removed that character from the film. *Ishq* was Kumar's first film to not star Madhuri Dixit as a female lead and the second movie with Aamir Khan after 1990's *Dil*. The film also marked the first collaboration between Kumar and Devgn.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nAnupama Chopra wrote, \"Despite fine performances it is a 70\u00a0mm melodrama\".[2] The film was a blockbuster at the box office. It earned \u20b953.2 crore, against a budget of \u20b910 crore. Its gross is equivalent to \u20b9368 crore adjusted for inflation in 2019.[3] It became the third-highest grossing film of 1997, behind *Dil To Pagal Hai* and *Border*.[4]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nThe music was composed by Anu Malik. The *Ishq* soundtrack album sold 3\u00a0million units, making it the year's sixth best-selling Bollywood soundtrack album.[5] The tune of the hit track \"Neend Churai Meri\" was copied from the Linear song \"Sending All My Love\". It was subsequently remade as *Maine Tujhko Dekha* by Malik's nephew Amaal Malik for the 2017 film *Golmaal Again*.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Title | Singer(s) | Lyrics | Length\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Neend Churai Meri\"\n | Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik & Kavita Krishnamurthy | Rahat Indori | 05:47\n |\n| \"Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai\"\n | Abhijeet, Anu Malik | Anu Malik\n | 05:08\n |\n| \"Dekho Dekho Jaanam\"\n | Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik\n | Rahat Indori\n | 05:14\n |\n| \"Ishq Hua...

The film follows a group of blue-collar deep-core drillers sent by NASA to stop a gigantic asteroid on a collision course with Earth. It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Bruce Willis with Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Keith David and Peter Stormare.\n\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing $553 million worldwide against a $140 million budget and becoming the highest-grossing film of 1998, and the highest grossing film to be released by Touchstone Pictures. However, the film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nA massive meteor shower destroys the orbiting Space Shuttle Atlantis, before entering the atmosphere and bombarding New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Moncton, Halifax, and Newfoundland. The meteors were pushed out of the asteroid belt by a collision from a rogue comet and a massive asteroid the size of Texas, and NASA learns that the asteroid will impact Earth in 18 days, potentially wiping out all life on Earth. NASA devises a plan to have a deep hole drilled into the asteroid, into which they will insert and detonate a nuclear bomb to destroy the asteroid.\n\n\nThey recruit Harry Stamper, a third-generation oil driller and owner of his own oil drilling company. Harry agrees to help, but on the condition that he bring in his own team to do the drilling. He picks his best employees for the job: Chick Chapel, his best friend and right-hand man; geologists Rockhound and Oscar Choice; and drillers Bear Curlene, Freddie Noonan, Max Lennert, and A.J. Frost (who has been dating Harry's daughter Grace despite Harry's objections). Over twelve days, they are trained to become astronauts with astronaut Willie Sharp, who will pilot *Freedom* \u2014 one of the two shuttles to fly to the asteroid, the other being the *Independence*. Before leaving, Chick apologizes to his ex-wife for wronging her and sees his son, who is unaware of his parentage. Grace accepts A.J.'s marriage proposal, much to Harry's reluctant dismay; she later has her father promise to return home safe with her fianc\u00e9.\n\n\nFollowing the destruction of Shanghai by another meteor strike, word of the massive asteroid becomes public to the world. Both shuttles take off without incident and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir to take on fuel. During fueling, a broken pipeline causes a leak and ignites the fuel pod on fire. A.J. and Roscosmos Cosmonaut Lev Andropov manage to board *Independence* before the space station is destroyed.\n\n\nApproaching the asteroid, *Independence* is damaged by debris and crashes, killing all on board except Lev, Bear, and A.J. They embark in the shuttle's Armadillo to find the *Freedom* crew, which lands 26 miles from its intended landing site. When the drilling goes slower than predicted, Sharp reports to Mission Control that it is unlikely the team will reach the depth necessary to destroy the asteroid before \"Zero Barrier\", the point after which detonating the rock will not save Earth. The President of the United States decides to remotely detonate the bomb from Earth immediately, which will cause total mission failure. Sharp and Harry have a vicious argument, but agree to defuse the bomb and work together after Harry promises Sharp that he will accomplish the mission. They make progress on drilling, but a missed gas pocket causes the Armadillo and Max to be blown into space. Just as Harry, NASA, and the world believe the mission to be a failure, while another meteor destroys Paris, A.J. and the others arrive in the second Armadillo.\n\n\nA.J. succeeds in drilling the hole to the required depth, but a rock storm kills Gruber and damages the remote detonator, forcing someone to stay behind and manually detonate the bomb. They draw straws; the responsibility falls upon A.J. Harry takes him down to the asteroid's surface, and disconnects A.J.'s air hose, forces him into the shuttle's air lock and tells A.J. that he is the son Harry never had and he would be proud to have him marry Grace. Using the Armadillo, Harry tearfully gives Grace his blessing to marry A.J., and Grace says that she is proud to be his daughter.\n\n\nAfter some difficulty, *Freedom* takes off, but then a second blowout causes Harry to lose his grip on the detonator. Just before Zero Barrier, he detonates the bomb and saves the planet. The astronauts land on Earth safely. A.J. and Grace are reunited and Chick reconciles with his ex-wife and estranged son. Later, A.J. and Grace are married with the portraits of Harry and the others lost on the mission present *in memoriam*.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Bruce Willis as Harry S.

In addition to Robert Roy Pool, Jonathan Hensleigh, Tony Gilroy, Shane Salerno and J. J. Abrams, the writers involved included Paul Attanasio, Ann Biderman, Scott Rosenberg and Robert Towne. Originally, it was Hensleigh's script, based on Pool's original, that had been given the green-light by Touchstone. Then-producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, hired the succession of scribes for rewrites and polishes.[4][5] Astronomers would subsequently note that *Deep Impact* was more scientifically accurate.[6][7]\n\n\nBruce Willis was cast in the film as part of a three-picture deal he cut with the studio to compensate them for the dissolution of 1997's *Broadway Brawler*.[8][9] He received a significant pay cut for the picture as part of the deal.[10] Sean Connery was originally considered for the role of Stamper, but Bay decided a younger actor in the role after meeting oil drillers.[11]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Armageddon* began in August 27, 1997 and ended on January 29, 1998.[12] In May 1998, Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth expanded the film's budget by $3\u00a0million to include additional special effects scenes by Dream Quest Images showing an asteroid impacting Paris. This additional footage, incorporated two months prior to the film's release, was specifically added for the television advertising campaign to visually differentiate the film from *Deep Impact* which was released a few months before.[13] At a budget of $140 million, it was Buena Vista's most expensive film at the time.[14]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Armageddon: The Album\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nPrior to *Armageddon*'s release, the film was advertised in Super Bowl XXXII at a cost of $2.6\u00a0million.[15]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nDespite a mixed critical reception, a DVD edition of *Armageddon* was released by The Criterion Collection, a specialist film distributor of primarily arthouse films that markets what it considers to be \"important classic and contemporary films\" and \"cinema at its finest\". In an essay supporting the selection of *Armageddon*, film scholar Jeanine Basinger, who taught Michael Bay at Wesleyan University, states that the film is \"a work of art by a cutting-edge artist who is a master of movement, light, color, and shape\u2014and also of chaos, razzle-dazzle, and explosion\". She sees it as a celebration of working men: \"This film makes these ordinary men noble, lifting their efforts up into an epic event.\" Further, she states that in the first few moments of the film all the main characters are well established, saying, \"If that isn't screenwriting, I don't know what is\".[16]\n\n\nThe film was also released on VHS and DVD by Touchstone Home Video on November 13, 1998, and would surpass *Pretty Woman* to become Buena Vista Home Entertainment's best-selling live-action title.[17] *Armageddon* then premiered on both VHS and DVD formats on February 1, 1999, in the UK. It was the country's best-selling DVD release, selling over 100,000 copies. However, this record would be surpassed by *The Matrix* later that year.[18] The film was released on a standard edition Blu-ray in 2010 with only a few special features.[19]\n\n\n\n### Television airing[edit]\n\n\nBy April 2002, ABC airings of *Armageddon* had already received modifications due to the September 11 attacks that occurred seven months prior. The scene where the World Trade Center was hit by meteors and caught on fire was edited out because of its similarity to the attacks.[20]\n\n\nFollowing the 2003 *Columbia* disaster, some screen captures from the opening scene where *Atlantis* is destroyed were passed off as satellite images of the disaster in a hoax.[21] Additionally, the American cable network FX, which had intended to broadcast *Armageddon* that evening, removed the film from its schedule and aired *Aliens* in its place.[22]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Armageddon* was released on July 1, 1998 in 3,127 theaters in the United States and Canada. It ranked first at the box office ahead of *Dr. Dolittle* with an opening weekend gross of $36 million, combined with $54.2 million from its first five days.[23] Upon opening, the film had the third-highest Fourth of July opening weekend at the time, behind *Men in Black* and *Independence Day*.[24] The film was dethroned by *Lethal Weapon 4* in its second weekend, although it collected a total of $23.5 million.[25] In late July 1998, it surpassed its rival *Deep Impact* to become the highest-grossing domestic release of the year.[26] The film grossed $201.6 million in the United States and Canada and $352.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $553.7 million.[2] It was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide and the second-highest-grossing film of that year in the United States, finishing just behind *Saving Private Ryan*.\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Armageddon* received mostly mixed reviews from film critics, many of whom took issue with \"the furious pace of its editing\".[27] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 43% \"Rotten\" approval rating based on 176 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The critical consensus states, \"Lovely to look at but about as intelligent as the asteroid that serves as the movie's antagonist, *Armageddon* slickly sums up the cinematic legacies of producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay.\"[28] Metacritic\u00a0gave the film a\u00a0weighted average\u00a0score of 42 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[29]\n\n\nThe film is on the list of Roger Ebert's most hated films.[30] In his original review, Ebert stated, \"The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained\". On *Siskel and Ebert*, Ebert gave it a Thumbs Down. However, his co-host Gene Siskel gave it a Thumbs Up, commenting on the noise and intensity of the film, but also stating that he found the film to be amusing. Ebert went on to name *Armageddon* as the worst film of 1998 (though he was originally considering *Spice World*).[31] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* also gave the film a negative review, noting Michael Bay's rapid cutting style: \"Much of the confusion, as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development, results directly from Bay's cutting style, which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 21\u20442 hours.\"[27]\n\n\n\nIn April 2013, in a *Miami Herald* interview to promote *Pain & Gain*, Bay was quoted as having said:\n\n\n> \u2026We had to do the whole movie in 16 weeks. It was a massive undertaking. That was not fair to the movie. I would redo the entire third act if I could. But the studio literally took the movie away from us. It was terrible. My visual effects supervisor had a nervous breakdown, so I had to be in charge of that. I called James Cameron and asked \"What do you do when you're doing all the effects yourself?\" But the movie did fine.[32]\n> \n> \n\nSome time after the article was published, Bay changed his stance, claiming that his apology only related to the editing of the film, not the whole film,[33] and accused the writer of the article for taking his words out of context. The author of the article, *Miami Herald* writer Rene Rodriguez, claimed: \"NBC asked me for a response, and I played them the tape. I didn't misquote anyone. All the sites that picked up the story did.\"[34]\n\n\n### Scientific accuracy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Asteroid deflection\n\nIn an interview with *Entertainment Weekly*, Bay admitted that the film's central premise \"that NASA could actually do something in a situation like this\" was unrealistic. Additionally, the largest known potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) is (53319) 1999 JM8, which is only 7 kilometres (4.3\u00a0mi) in diameter,[35] while the asteroid in the movie is described as being \"the size of Texas\". Near the end of the credits, there is a disclaimer stating, \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's cooperation and assistance does not reflect an endorsement of the contents of the film or the treatment of the characters depicted therein.\"[36]\n\n\nThe infeasibility of the H-bomb approach was published by four undergraduate physics students in 2011[37] and then reported by *The Daily Telegraph* in 2012:\n\n\n\n\n> A mathematical analysis of the situation found that for Willis's approach to be effective, he would need to be in possession of an H-bomb a billion times stronger than the Soviet Union's \"Big Ivan\", the biggest ever detonated on Earth. Using estimates of the asteroid's size, density, speed and distance from Earth based on information in the film, the postgraduate students from Leicester University found that to split the asteroid in two, with both pieces clearing Earth, would require 800\u00a0trillion terajoules of energy. In contrast, the total energy output of \"Big Ivan\", which was tested by the Soviet Union in 1961, was only 418,000 terajoules.[38][39]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn the commentary track, Ben Affleck says he \"asked Michael why it was easier to train oil drillers to become astronauts than it was to train astronauts to become oil drillers, and he told me to shut the fuck up, so that was the end of that talk.\"[40]\n\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson said on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* on October 2, 2023 to Stephen Colbert that by far *Moonfall* was a movie which violated more laws of physics per minute than any other movie ever, even more than the 1998 movie *Armageddon*.[41]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | Best Original Song | \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\"  Music and Lyrics by Diane Warren | Nominated\n | [42] |\n| Best Sound | Kevin O'Connell, Greg P.

The first one, \"Space Shuttle with Armadillo drilling unit\", included an X-71, a small, rough Armadillo and a pedestal. The second one, \"Russian Space Center\", included the *Mir*, with the docking adapter seen in the film, and another pedestal.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2011, Fantastic Plastic released another X-71 kit, the \"X-71 Super Shuttle\", the goal of which was to be more accurate than the Revell/Monogram kit.[56]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attraction[edit]\n\n\nArmageddon \u2013 Les Effets Speciaux was an attraction based on *Armageddon* at Walt Disney Studios Park located at Disneyland Paris.[57] The attraction simulated the scene in the movie in which the Russian Space Station is destroyed.[58] Michael Clarke Duncan (\"Bear\" in the film) was featured in the pre-show.[58]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Asteroid deflection strategies\n* List of disaster films\n* List of films featuring space stations\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tied with *Dark City*.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Armageddon* (12)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men \u2013 Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski, and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915\u20131919 at slightly more than $5.2\u00a0million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2\u00a0million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n254. **^** Hall & Neale 2010, p.\u00a0214. \"*Rocky* was the \"sleeper of the decade\".

Essentially belonging to the exploitation genre, it was marketed as an educational sex hygiene film in an effort to circumvent censorship laws. Falling foul of the Motion Picture Production Code, *Mom and Dad* was prevented from obtaining mainstream distribution and restricted to independent and drive-in theaters. It was the biggest hit of its kind, and remained in continual distribution until the 1970s when hardcore pornography eventually took over. At the end of 1947 it had earned $2\u00a0million, and by 1949, $8\u00a0million; by 1956 it had earned $22\u00a0million in rentals, representing a gross of $80\u00a0million, and would have easily placed in the top ten films in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Estimates of its total earnings are as high as $100\u00a0million.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCIThe Cinerama figures represent gross amounts. Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Pre-2020 releases: \"Titanic (1997)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n181. **^** Burns, Douglas (2010), *The Greatest Show on Earth*, pp.\u00a0354\u2013355, By May 1953, *Variety* was reporting that the Best Picture winner had amassed $18.35\u00a0million in worldwide rentals.

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32\u00a0million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Main series | $3,059,525,837\n | 7\n | $437,075,120\n | *Days of Future Past* ($746,045,700)\n |\n| 1\n | *Days of Future Past* (2014) | $746,045,700 |\n| 2\n | *Apocalypse* (2016) | $543,934,105 |\n| 3\n | *The Last Stand* (2006) | $460,435,291 |\n| 4\n | *X2* (2003) | $407,711,549 |\n| 5\n | *First Class* (2011) | $352,616,690 |\n| 6\n | *X-Men* (2000) | $296,339,528 |\n| 7\n | *Dark Phoenix* (2019) | $252,442,974\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Deadpool *series** | $1,568,508,764\n | 2\n | $784,254,382\n | *Deadpool 2* ($785,896,609)\n |\n| 1\n | *Deadpool 2* (2018) | $785,896,609 |\n| 2\n | *Deadpool* (2016) | $782,612,155\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Wolverine *series** | $1,406,912,546\n | 3\n | $468,970,849\n | *Logan* ($619,021,436)\n |\n| 1\n | *Logan* (2017) | $619,021,436 |\n| 2\n | *The Wolverine* (2013) | $414,828,246 |\n| 3\n | *Origins: Wolverine* (2009) | $373,062,864\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n132. **^** Chartier, Roy (September 6, 1938). \"You Can't Take It With You\". *Variety*.

Distributor rentals: It is also important to know and recognize the difference between the distributor's gross receipts and the gross rentals. The term \"rentals\" refers to the aggregate amount of the film distributor's share of monies paid at theatre box offices computed on the basis of negotiated agreements between the distributor and the exhibitor. Note that gross receipts refers to amounts actually received and from all markets and media, whereas gross rentals refers to amounts earned from theatrical exhibition only, regardless of whether received by the distributor.

Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* ($303m) and *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* ($301.95m).\n\n## Adjusted for ticket-price inflation[edit]\n\n\nThis chart ranks films by gross adjusted for ticket price inflation up to 2020 levels, based on data from Box Office Mojo, which was last updated in 2019 based on an average domestic movie ticket price of $9.01, and applying the Template:Inflation for the following years up to 2022 levels, due to the lack of updates on the original source.[7] It was compiled by multiplying the average ticket price in the current year by an estimate of the total number of admissions. Where the number of admissions is unknown, they are estimated by dividing the nominal gross by the average ticket price in the year of release to provide an estimate (taking re-releases into account).[8] Admissions better reflect the popularity of older films, since they are less susceptible to the effects of inflation.\n\n\nMany of the films on this list were released prior to the availability of home video and have had multiple releases.\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n| Rank\n

referential adjusted gross for a film,[*original research?*] since doing so would have to take into account most (or all) of the following:\n\n\n\n* Box office gross on *initial* release\n* Ticket price at time of release, or its relative price to other commodities in a given year,[10] in relation to general inflation and gross domestic product.[13]\n* economic conditions that may help or hurt the entertainment industry as a whole (theaters in 2008 lowered ticket prices to attract more viewers though the average ticket cost $7.00)[10]\n* Population at time of release\u2014to be used to calculate:\n* Availability of films (number of theaters and screens, number of prints)\n* Competition of other media (television, internet, home video, film piracy)[10]\n* Total number of films in the marketplace at a given time[10]\n* Screen quotas (no influence on U.S. box office)\n* Price differences: matinee and evening tickets,[14] roadshow tickets,[14] or difference between rural and urban cinemas[13]\n* Length of release (number of weeks)[14]\n\n\nFurther explanation of issues with calculating an adjusted gross can be found in the article for List of highest-grossing films.\n\n\n\n## Franchises and film series not adjusted for inflation[edit]\n\n\nThis is a list of highest-grossing franchises and film series in the U.S. and Canada.[15]\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates

It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz. It is the fourth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the first film of the prequel trilogy and the first chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set 32 years before the original trilogy, (13 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire), during the era of the Galactic Republic, the plot follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to protect Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker\u2014a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force\u2014they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith. The film was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Return of the Jedi* (1983), talks of a follow-up were proposed, but Lucas was unmotivated to return to the franchise. During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that computer-generated imagery (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's visual effects, Lucas began writing *The Phantom Menace* in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997\u2014at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert\u2014and ended on September 30. The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original *Star Wars*[b] in 1977.\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was released in theaters on May 19, 1999, almost 16 years after the premiere of *Return of the Jedi*. The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the *Star Wars* saga had cultivated. Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters\u2014particularly Jar Jar Binks\u2014received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America (behind *Titanic*), and the highest-grossing *Star Wars* film at the time (inflation notwithstanding). A 3D reissue, which earned an additional $102.7 million and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over $1 billion, was released in February 2012. *Attack of the Clones* (2002) and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *The Phantom Menace*, rounding out the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe Trade Federation upsets order in the Galactic Republic by blockading the planet Naboo in secret preparation for a full-scale invasion. The Republic's leader, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, dispatches Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord and the Trade Federation's secret benefactor, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi and begin their invasion with an army of battle droids. The Jedi escape and flee to Naboo. During the invasion, Qui-Gon rescues a bumbling Gungan outcast, Jar Jar Binks. Indebted to Qui-Gon, Jar Jar leads the Jedi to Otoh Gunga, the Gungans' underwater city. The Jedi fail to persuade the Gungan leader, Boss Nass, to help the planet's surface dwellers, but manage to obtain Jar Jar's guidance and underwater transport to Theed, the capital city of Naboo. After rescuing Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the group makes their escape from Naboo aboard her Royal Starship, intending to reach the Republic capital planet of Coruscant.\n\n\nPassing through the Federation blockade, the ship is damaged in the crossfire, and its hyperdrive malfunctions. The group land for repairs on the outlying desert planet of Tatooine, situated beyond the Republic's jurisdiction. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, astromech droid R2-D2, and Padm\u00e9\u2014disguised as one of her handmaidens\u2014visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase a new part for their hyperdrive. They encounter a junk dealer, Watto, and his nine-year-old slave, Anakin Skywalker, a gifted pilot and engineer who has built a protocol droid, C-3PO.\nQui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within Anakin and is convinced that he is the prophesied \"Chosen One,\" destined to restore balance to the Force. With Watto refusing to accept payment in Republic currency, Qui-Gon wagers both the required hyperdrive part and Anakin's freedom in a podrace. Anakin wins the race and joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, leaving behind his mother, Shmi. En route to their starship, Qui-Gon is attacked by Darth Maul, Sidious' apprentice, who was sent to capture Amidala. After a brief lightsaber duel, Qui-Gon escapes on board the starship with the others.\n\n\nQui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Padm\u00e9 to Coruscant so that she can plead her people's case to Valorum and the Galactic Senate. Qui-Gon reports to the Jedi Council about the Sith and he requests permission to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council refuses, concerned that Anakin is vulnerable to the dark side of the Force. Undaunted, Qui-Gon vows to take up Anakin as his new apprentice. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator Palpatine persuades Amidala to call for a vote of no confidence in Valorum to elect a more capable leader and to resolve the crisis. Though she is successful in pushing for the vote, Amidala grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate and decides to return to Naboo. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are ordered by the Jedi Council to accompany the queen and investigate the return of the Sith, whom they had believed to be extinct for more than a millennium.\n\n\nOn Naboo, Padm\u00e9 reveals herself as the queen before the Gungans and persuades them to join in an alliance against the Trade Federation. Jar Jar is promoted to general and joins his tribe in a battle against the droid army, while Padm\u00e9 leads the search for Gunray in Theed. During a battle in the hangar, Anakin flees to a starfighter and accidentally triggers its autopilot, traveling to a space battle against the Federation droid control ship and inadvertently causing its destruction from within, deactivating the droid army. Meanwhile, Darth Maul engages Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel. Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon before being bisected by Obi-Wan and falling down a shaft.[c] Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan to train Anakin before dying in his arms.\n\n\nFollowing the battle, Gunray is arrested by the Republic and Palpatine is elected Chancellor. Grandmaster Yoda promotes Obi-Wan to the rank of Jedi Knight and reluctantly accepts Anakin as Obi-Wan's apprentice. A funeral is held for Qui-Gon, attended by the other Jedi, who contemplate that there are only two Sith at any given time; a master and an apprentice. At a celebratory parade on Naboo, Padm\u00e9 presents a gift of thanks to Boss Nass and the Gungans to establish peace.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n![A photograph of Liam Neeson](image)\n![A photograph of Ewan McGregor](image)\n![A photograph of Natalie Portman](image)\nLeft to right: Liam Neeson (pictured in 2012), Ewan McGregor (2012) and Natalie Portman (2015)\n\n* Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master who discovers Anakin Skywalker and under the belief that he is destined to bring balance to the force as the prophesied \"Chosen One\", insists that the boy be trained as a Jedi, despite the Jedi Council's refusal to do so. Lucas originally wanted to cast an American actor in the role, but cast Neeson (who is Northern Irish) because he considered that Neeson had great skills and presence. Lucas said Neeson was a \"master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.\"[3]\n* Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon's twenty-five-year-old Jedi Padawan, who holds his master in high regard but questions his motives at times, especially when it seems he is breaking the rules of the Jedi. McGregor was cast from a shortlist of fifty actors, all of whom had to be compared to pictures of young Alec Guinness, who portrayed the elderly Obi-Wan, to make a believable younger version.[4] McGregor had a vocal coach to help his voice sound closer to Guinness's. He also studied several of Guinness's performances, from his early work and the original *Star Wars* films.[3]\n* Natalie Portman as Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the fourteen-year-old Queen of Naboo, who hopes to protect her planet from the Trade Federation's blockade invasion. Throughout most of the film, she uses her birth name Padm\u00e9 Naberrie and poses as one of the queen's handmaidens for protection. Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role.[5] The production notes stated that \"The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open\". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in *L\u00e9on: The Professional* (1994) and *Beautiful Girls* (1996), which impressed Lucas.[3] He stated, \"I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [and] Natalie embodied all those traits and more\".[3] Portman was unfamiliar with *Star Wars* before being cast,[3] but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, \"It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I think it will be good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader.\"[6]\n* Jake Lloyd as Anakin \"Ani\" Skywalker, a nine-year-old slave boy and a skilled pilot who dreams of becoming a Jedi. Hundreds of actors were tested across the UK, Ireland, Canada and the United States[3] before the producers settled on Lloyd, who Lucas considered met his requirements of \"a good actor, enthusiastic and very energetic\". Producer Rick McCallum said that Lloyd was \"smart, mischievous, and loves anything mechanical\u2014just like Anakin.\"[7]\n* Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, a middle-aged senator of Naboo and a secret Sith Lord who orchestrates the invasion of his home planet to get elected Supreme Chancellor. He is the Trade Federation's mysterious benefactor, and the titular \"Phantom Menace\". McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him sixteen years after *Return of the Jedi* to reprise the role of Palpatine, having assumed that a younger actor would play the role in the prequel films.[8]\n* Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, a clumsy Gungan exiled from his home and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting director Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco.[7] Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data, but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character.[9] Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.[7]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, a protocol droid built by Anakin. He lacks a metal covering in this film; R2-D2 humorously refers to it as being \"naked\". Industrial Light & Magic's Michael Lynch, dressed in a color closely matching the background\u2014in a manner similar to the Japanese puppet theater Bunraku\u2014 manipulated a skeletal C-3PO figure attached to his front while Daniels read his lines off-camera. The puppeteer was erased from the film during post-production.[7][10]\n* Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid from Naboo that saves Queen Amidala's ship when other astro droids fail. Before the film's production started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would reprise the role. Baker is used for scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side-to-side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.[*citation needed*]\n* Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother, who is concerned for her son's future and allows him to leave with the Jedi. August, a veteran of Swedish cinema, was chosen after auditioning with Liam Neeson. She was afraid of being rejected because of her accent.[9]\n* Frank Oz as Yoda, the centuries-old Jedi Grandmaster and head of the Jedi Council who is apprehensive about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth, and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls.[9] Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted *In & Out*.[11] A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis (who played the part of the Ewok Wicket W. Warrick in *Return of the Jedi* in 1983) portrays him in the scene where Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight.[12] Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough at the time. Beginning with the 2011 Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda replaced the puppet entirely.[13]\n* Oliver Ford Davies as Sio Bibble, the governor of Naboo.[*citation needed*]\n* Hugh Quarshie as Captain Quarsh Panaka, Queen Amidala's chief of security at the Theed Palace.[*citation needed*]\n* Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, a Jedi Master and high-ranking member of the Jedi Council who opposes training Anakin.\n* Ray Park as Darth Maul, Darth Sidious's Zabrak Sith apprentice, who wields a double-bladed lightsaber\n\t+ Peter Serafinowicz as the voice of Darth Maul[9]\n* Terence Stamp as Finis Valorum, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic who commissions Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to negotiate with the Trade Federation viceroy. Lucas described the character as a \"good man but he's beleaguered\u2014a bit like [Bill] Clinton\".[14]\n* Keira Knightley as Sab\u00e9, one of Queen Amidala's handmaidens who serves as her decoy throughout the majority of the film.[*citation needed*]\n* Silas Carson as:[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Nute Gunray, the viceroy of the Trade Federation who leads Naboo's invasion and tries to force Queen Amidala to sign a treaty to legitimize their occupation of the planet.\n\t+ Ki-Adi-Mundi, a wise and powerful Jedi Master who sits on the council.\n\t+ Lott Dod, a Trade Federation Senator.\n\t+ An ill-fated pilot. This was the role for which Carson originally auditioned.[15]\n* Jerome St. John Blake as:[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Rune Haako, Gunray's chief lieutenant and Settlement Officer in the Trade Federation.\n\t\t- James Taylor as the voice of Rune Haako.[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Oppo Rancisis, a Jedi Master and member of the council.\n\t+ Orn Free Taa, a Twi-lek senator.\n\t+ Mas Amedda, a Chagrian politician and Vice Chair of the galactic senate.\n\n\nAdditionally, Brian Blessed voiced Boss Nass, the leader of the Gungan tribe who allies with the Naboo surface dwellers; Andy Secombe voiced Watto, a junk dealer on Tatooine who owns Anakin and his mother as slaves; and Lewis MacLeod voiced Sebulba, an aggressive, scheming podracer who is Anakin's main rival at the Boonta Eve podrace. Greg Proops and Scott Capurro voiced Fode and Beed, respectively, the two-headed announcer of the Boonta Eve Race. Alan Ruscoe appears as Jedi Master Plo Koon and Neimoidian Daultay Dofine, commander of the Trade Federation's droid control ships. Ralph Brown plays Ric Olie, commander of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps and chief pilot aboard Queen Amidala's starship, while Matthew Wood appears as the Twi'lek Bib Fortuna alongside a CGI Jabba the Hutt, who is voiced by Scott Schumann. Dominic West plays the role of an unnamed Naboo guard, and Sofia Coppola appears as Sach\u00e9, one of Amidala's handmaidens. Christian Simpson appears as Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes.[16] Lindsay Duncan voices TC-14, a protocol droid on the Federation ship. Sally Hawkins made her screen debut as an uncredited villager.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nWhile writing the original *Star Wars* film,[b] Lucas decided the story was too vast to be covered in one film. He introduced a wider story arc that could be told in sequels if it became successful.[17][18] He negotiated a contract that allowed him to make two sequels, and over time created an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process.[19] While writing the second film *The Empire Strikes Back*, Lucas considered directions in which to take the story. In the original trilogy, Darth Vader was revealed to have been Anakin Skywalker, a once-powerful Jedi Knight, and a traitor to the Jedi Order.[20] With this backstory in place, Lucas decided that the movies would work best as a trilogy.[21] In the trilogy's final episode, *Return of the Jedi*, Vader is redeemed through an act of sacrifice for Luke.[22]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Lucas said he had no desire to return to *Star Wars* and had canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of *Return of the Jedi*. However, because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him.[23] In the early 1990s, *Star Wars* saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels. Lucas saw that there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy, and with the development of special effects generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film.[24] In October 1993, it was announced in *Variety* and other sources that he would be making the prequels.[25] Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the protagonist, and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. A relic of the original outline was that Anakin would, like his son, grow up on Tatooine.[26] Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series; instead of filling in the tangential history, they would form the beginning of a long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.[27]\n\n\nLucas began writing the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy on November 1, 1994. The screenplay of *Star Wars* was adapted from Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help him keep track of the characters' backstories and events that occurred before the original trilogy.[28] Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt that the lower age would better fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes.[29] The film's working title was *The Beginning*, with the title not being changed to *The Phantom Menace* until shortly before the film's completion.[28] Lucas later revealed that the *Phantom Menace* title was a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.[30]\n\n\nThe larger budget and possibilities opened up by the use of digital effects made Lucas \"think about a much grander, more epic scale\u2014\"which is what I wanted *Star Wars* to be\".[31] The story ended with five simultaneous, ongoing plots, one leading to another. The central plot is Palpatine's intent to become Chancellor, which leads to the Trade Federation's attack on Naboo, the Jedi being sent there, Anakin being met along the way, and the rise of the Sith Lords. As with the original trilogy, Lucas intended *The Phantom Menace* to illustrate several themes throughout the narrative. Duality is a frequent theme; Amidala is a queen who passes as a handmaiden, Palpatine plays on both sides of the war, among others. \"Balance\" is frequently suggested; Anakin is supposedly \"the one\" chosen to bring balance to the Force\u2014Lucas said, \"Anakin needed to have a mother, Obi-Wan needed a Master, Darth Sidious needed an apprentice\" as without interaction and dialogue, \"you wouldn't have drama\".[32]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Ron Howard confirmed that he, Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg were approached by Lucas to direct *The Phantom Menace*. All three approached directors told Lucas that he should direct the film, as they each found the project \"too daunting.\"[33]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production and design[edit]\n\n\nBefore Lucas had started writing, his producing partner Rick McCallum was preparing for the film. McCallum stated that his experience with *The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles* led to many of his decisions on *The Phantom Menace*, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, and the creation of sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.[34][35] Art development on the film began in January 1995.[36]\n\n\nWithin three to four months of Lucas beginning the writing process, Chiang and his design team started a two-year process of reviewing thousands of designs for the film.[37] Chiang stated that Lucas intended *Episode I* to be stylistically different from the other *Star Wars* films; it would be \"richer and more like a period piece, since it was the history leading up to *A New Hope*.\" The story takes place on three planets, some with varied environments such as the human and Gungan cities of Naboo and three buildings in Coruscant. With the exception of the Gungan city, which had an art nouveau-inspired visual, these locations would be given distinctive looks with some basis in the real world. The concept drawings of Ralph McQuarrie for the original trilogy served as the basis for Mos Espa\u2014which was also inspired by old Tunisian hotels and buildings and had touches such as a marketplace to differentiate it from *A New Hope*'s Mos Eisley\u2014and Coruscant, in particular a metropolis design that became the basis for the Senate.[38] Bocquet would later develop the work of Chiang's team and design the interiors, translating the concepts into construction blueprints with environments and architectural styles that had some basis in reality \"to give the audience something to key into.\"[39] Some elements were directly inspired by the original trilogy; Lucas described the battle droids as predecessors to the stormtroopers. Chiang uses that orientation to base the droids on the Imperial soldiers, only in the same style of stylized and elongated features seen in tribal African art.[31]\n\n\nTerryl Whitlatch, who had a background on zoology and anatomy, was in charge of creature design. Many of the aliens are hybrids, combining features of real animals. At times, entire food chains were developed, even though only a small percentage of them would appear in the film. Whitlatch also designed detailed skeletons for the major characters and facial muscles on Jar Jar Binks as a reference for ILM's animators. Each creature would reflect its environment; those on Naboo were more beautiful because the planet is \"lush and more animal-friendly\", Tatooine has rough-looking creatures \"with weather-beaten leathery skin to protect them from the harsh desert elements\", and Coruscant has bipedal, human-looking aliens.[40]\n\n\nThe film made extensive use of the new technique of digital pre-visualization, using computers to essentially create 3-D animated storyboards. This was done for dozens of scenes in the film but was first and primarily used in the pod race sequence. Animatic supervisor David Dozoretz, also an ILM alum, worked on this sequence for nearly three years, and at one point had a 25-minute version of the race, although the film only included a 9-minute version.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![Three men fight with laser swords in an hangar.](image)Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling Darth Maul. Lucas wanted the lightsaber battles to be fast and more intense than those of the original trilogy, depicting the Jedi in their prime. This scene was highly praised by critics and audiences.\nStunt coordinator Nick Gillard was recruited to create a new Jedi fighting style for the prequel trilogy. Gillard likened the lightsaber battles to a chess game \"with every move being a check\". Because of their short-range weapons, Gillard thought that the Jedi would have had to develop a fighting style that merged every sword fighting style, such as kendo and other kenjutsu styles, with other swinging techniques, such as tennis swings and tree-chopping. While training Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, Gillard wrote a sequence that lasted around 60 seconds and intended to be around five or six sequences per fight.[41] Lucas later referred to the Jedi as \"negotiators\" rather than high-casualty soldiers. The preference of hand-to-hand combat was intended to give a spiritual and intellectual role to the Jedi.[41] Because Gillard thought that the stunt jumps with the actors and stuntmen dangling from wires did not look realistic, air rams were used to propel them into the air instead.[42]\n\n\nLucas decided to make elaborate costumes, because the film's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy. Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures.[43] Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world: Tatooine followed *A New Hope* with sun-bleached sand colors, Coruscant had grays, browns and blacks, and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore \"a leathery look, like their skin\". The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film;[44] Obi-Wan's costume was inspired by the costume that was worn by Guinness. Lucas said he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to \"translat[e] all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look silly\". Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure that the costumes would accommodate action scenes, and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics \"wouldn't wear too heavily\" on the alien skins. A huge wardrobe department was set up at Leavesden Film Studios to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones.[45]\n\n\nNute Gunray's Thai accent was chosen after Lucas and McCallum listened to various languages to decide how the Neimoidians would speak.[46] The character design of Watto was an amalgam of rejected ideas; his expressions were based on video footage of Secombe's voice acting, photographs of animation supervisor Rob Coleman imitating the character, and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto's lines to a mirror.[47] Lucas described Sebulba's design as \"a spider crossed with an orangutan crossed with a sloth\",[48] with a camel-like face, and clothing inspired by medieval armor.[49]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nAfter Samuel L. Jackson expressed interest in appearing in a *Star Wars* film, he was approached by casting director Robin Gurland to play Mace Windu.[7] Jackson was originally slated to play Grando Calrissian, the father of *The Empire Strikes Back* character Lando Calrissian, but that character was dropped when Jackson signed on to play Windu instead.[50] Rapper Tupac Shakur was also considered for the role of Mace Windu.[51] Ray Park, a martial arts champion with experience in gymnastics and sword fighting, was originally a member of the stunt crew.[7] Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard filmed Park to demonstrate his conception of the lightsaber battles. Lucas and McCallum were so impressed with the test tape that they gave Park the role of Maul. His voice was considered \"too squeaky\" and was dubbed over in post-production by Peter Serafinowicz.[9] Keira Knightley's parents tried to convince her not to audition, but the teenage actress still sought a role since she was a *Star Wars* fan.[52] The casting was influenced by Knightley's remarkable similarity to Natalie Portman, with the actress admitting their mothers could not tell them apart.[53] Knightley was reported to have \"cried every single day\" due to finding the wardrobe uncomfortable.[52]\n\n\nOver 3,000 actors auditioned for the role of Anakin Skywalker including Haley Joel Osment, Cameron Finley, Justin Berfield and Michael Angarano before Jake Lloyd was selected.[54] Vinette Robinson auditioned for the role of Padm\u00e9 Amidala.[55] Benicio del Toro was originally cast as Darth Maul but later left the project when the character's lines were cut.[56] Michael Jackson expressed interest in playing Jar Jar Binks, but he wanted to do it in prosthetic make ups while George Lucas wanted to do it in CGI.[57] Joseph Fiennes auditioned for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi and nearly landed the part until George Lucas's young daughter rejected him upon meeting him during the second level of auditioning.[58]\n\n\nSilas Carson was cast as Nute Gunray because another actor was uncomfortable with the costumes used by the Trade Federation characters, which were hot, exerted a lot of pressure on the bearer, and took about 15 minutes to apply. Hugh Quarshie considered the part of Panaka as \"a good career move\" and a production that would be fun to make.[59] Brian Blessed originally auditioned for the role of Sio Bibble, the Governor of Naboo,[60] for which he was considered \"too loud\".[61] Casting director Robin Gurland approached him to play Nass because it was a \"bigger than life\" character with \"a kind of bravado\".[62] Blessed described Nass as a \"reluctant hero\".[61] Sofia Coppola, daughter of Lucas' long-time friend and creative partner Francis Ford Coppola, considers Lucas as \"like an uncle to me\". As she prepared the script for her directorial debut *The Virgin Suicides*, Coppola heard Lucas would be making a new *Star Wars* film and asked him if she could accompany him during filming. Lucas offered Coppola a role in the royal entourage, which she accepted because it \"seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way\".[63]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars filming locations\n\n![Rocky buildings and an antenna-like structure in a desert.](image)Remains of Mos Espa in the Tunisian desert, near Nafta\nFilming began on June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, primarily taking place at Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a two and a half year period so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed.[64] The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire.[65][66] Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998.[67] Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.[42]\n\n\nThe Tunisian desert was again used for the Tatooine scenes;[68] Mos Espa was built outside the city of Tozeur. On the night following the third day of shooting in Tozeur, an unexpected sandstorm destroyed many of the sets and props. The production was quickly rescheduled to allow for repairs and was able to leave Tunisia on the date originally planned.[69] The Italian Caserta Palace was used as the interior of the Theed City Naboo Palace;[68] it was used as a location for four days after it had been closed to visitors. Scenes with explosions were filmed on replica sets in Leavesden.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palace of Caserta, in Italy, was the location for the Naboo Royal Palace.\nA binder with the film's storyboards served as a reference for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed in front of a chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds, or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tattersall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.[71]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was the final *Star Wars* film to be shot on 35mm film until *The Force Awakens* (2015). Some scenes, mostly of elements filmed by the special effects team, were shot on high definition digital video tapes to test the performance of digital recordings, which Lucas and McCallum considered the next logical step because of the amount of digitizing\u2014an expensive process compared to recording directly on digital media\u2014for the compositing of computer-generated effects. A couple of digitally shot scenes made it into the movie, one of them being of Qui-Gon taking a blood sample of Anakin Skywalker.[72] All future films would be shot using Sony CineAlta high-definition video cameras.[73][74] Greg Proops and Scott Capurro were filmed wearing makeup and blue bodysuits so their heads could be joined in a computer-generated body. The visual effects crew did not like the original results and crafted Fode and Beed as an entirely computer generated alien.[75]\n\n\nBecause of the amount of visual effects produced, editing took two years; Paul Martin Smith started the process in England and focused on dialogue-heavy scenes. Ben Burtt\u2014who was also the film's sound editor\u2014was responsible for action sequences under Lucas' supervision. Non-linear editing systems played a large part in translating Lucas' vision; he constantly tweaked, revised and reworked shots and scenes. The final sound mix was added in March 1999, and the following month, the film was completed after the delivery of the remaining visual effects shots.[76]\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"Writing the script was much more enjoyable this time around because I wasn't constrained by anything. You can't write one of these movies without knowing how you're going to accomplish it. With CG at my disposal, I knew I could do whatever I wanted\".\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u00a0\u2014George Lucas[77]\n\nThe film saw a breakthrough in computer generated effects. About 1,950 of the shots in *The Phantom Menace* have visual effects. The scene in which toxic gas is released on the Jedi is the only sequence with no digital alteration.[48] The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselves\u2014John Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.[78]\n\n\nUntil the film's production, many special effects in the film industry were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings and on-set visual effects\u2014although other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those that would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, he did not know how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation.[79] Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes.[48] Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.[80]\n\n\nLucas, who had previously confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department to create their own versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving 440 pounds (200\u00a0kg), enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.[81]\n\n\nLucas originally planned to create many of the aliens with computer graphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimoidians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.[82]\n\n\nTo research for the podrace vehicles, the visual effects crew visited a jet aircraft junkyard outside Phoenix, Arizona and scavenged four Boeing 747 engines.[48] Life-sized replicas of the engines were built and sent to Tunisia to provide reference in the film. Except for Jake Lloyd inside a hydraulically controlled cockpit and a few practical podracer models, the entire podracing scene\u2014which the effects crew designed to be as \"out of this world\" as possible\u2014is computer-generated.[68][83]\n\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\nLike previous *Star Wars* films, *The Phantom Menace* makes several references to historical events and films that George Lucas watched in his youth. The *Star Wars* films typically mix several concepts from different mythologies together, drawing heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[84] The film also notably borrows from *Ben-Hur* (1959), including the podrace sequence, which mirrors the chariot race scene; additionally, the end celebration scene closely resembles a Roman parade in *Ben-Hur*.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)The face of Darth Maul drew upon depictions of the devil.\nThere are many references to Christianity in the film, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil, complete with red skin and horns.[84] The *Star Wars* film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the \"Chosen One\"\u2014the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Force\u2014who was conceived of a virgin birth. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin will eventually fall from grace and seemingly fail to fulfill his destiny (until the prophecy comes true in *Return of the Jedi*).[86]\n\n\nJapanese films such as Akira Kurosawa's *The Hidden Fortress* (1958) influenced the original *Star Wars* film; scholars say that *The Phantom Menace* was likewise influenced by Korean and Japanese culture. Film historians Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska write, \"The costume and make-up designs\u00a0...\u00a0favour a mixture of the gothic and the oriental over anything very futuristic. The gothic is most strongly apparent in Darth Maul's demonic horns and the red and black make-up mask that borrows from the facial designs found in depictions of Japanese demons.\" King and Krzywinska say that \"Qui-Gon's pony tail and Obi-Wan's position of apprentice further encourage a reading in terms of the Samurai tradition\". They also say \"Amidala, in keeping with her status and character, has a number of highly formal outfits\u00a0...\u00a0to go with hair sculpted into a curve that frames make-up of a Japanese cast\".[87]\n\n\nThe Jedi practice Zen-like meditation and martial arts, as did the ancient Japanese Samurai warriors. The name \"Qui-Gon\" adapts the term qigong, which refers to a Chinese discipline involving meditation and cultivation of the flow of the vital energy called \"*qi*\" for healing, health, and combat. The words *qi* (Chinese), *gi* (Korean), *ki* (Japanese), and the Indian term \"Prana\" all refer to the energy that is thought to flow through all living things, from the source of all *qi* (or power), which is \"The Way\" or \"The Tao\" in Chinese philosophy. In Taoist philosophy, from The Way, yin and yang\u2014the opposing but complementary aspects of reality or nature\u2014are born. Unlike Chinese philosophy, in which yin and yang are not moral qualities, the ancient Persian philosophy of Zurvanism taught that the dualism of dark and light forces are locked in an eternal battle while being two sides (or evolutes) of the same \"Force\", the force of time itself (Zurvan)\u2014the prime mover. These elements derive primarily from Eastern and Iranian religions and myths.[84]\n\n\nAs with other *Star Wars* films, themes about family and hope are featured prominently. In the *Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian* episode \"Legacy\", Dave Filoni explains that the use of \"Duel of the Fates\" during the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul against Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi represents the fight for the fate of Anakin Skywalker. According to Filoni, Qui-Gon Jinn acts like a father figure towards Anakin because he feels he needs one after taking him from his mother, having realized that the Jedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care. In the end, Qui-Gon dies, and thus Anakin loses his father figure; Obi-Wan Kenobi ultimately becomes his master to honor Jinn's dying wish despite his initial contempt for him, and while he comes to eventually see him like a brother as shown in *Attack of the Clones* and *Revenge of the Sith*, he doesn't act like a father, which coupled with the Jedi's indifference, seals Anakin's fate.[88]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)\n\nAs with previous *Star Wars* films, *Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace*'s score was composed and conducted by John Williams. He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on February 10, 1999. Williams decided to use electronic instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the sound and choral pieces to \"capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra might not have been able to provide\", and create an atmosphere that was \"more mysterious and mystical and less military\" than those of the original trilogy.[89] One of the most notable tracks is \"Duel of the Fates\", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. The track was made into a music video.[90] While composing Anakin's theme, Williams tried to reflect the innocence of his childhood and to foreshadow his transformation into Darth Vader by using slight suggestions of \"The Imperial March\" in the melody.[89]\n\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on May 4, 1999. This album featured the score, which Williams restructured as a listening experience; it is not presented in film order and omits many notable cues from the film because of the space restriction of the compact disc.[91] A two-disc \"Ultimate Edition\" was released on November 14, 2000. The set features the entire score as it is heard in the film, including all of the edits and loops that were made for the sound mix.[92]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm spent US$20 million on the film's advertising campaign and made promotional licensing deals with Hasbro, Lego, Tricon Global Restaurants and PepsiCo.[93] Lucasfilm also helped the *Star Wars* fan club to organize an event called *Star Wars* Celebration, which was held in Denver, Colorado, between April 30 and May 2, 1999.[94]\n\n\nThe first teaser trailer was released on selected screens accompanying *Meet Joe Black* on November 17, 1998,[95] and media reported that people were paying full admission at theaters to see the trailer. Other films that played this trailer included *The Waterboy*, *The Siege* and *A Bug's Life*.[96] To keep fans from leaving before the movie was over, some theaters played the teaser an additional time after the film finished.[97] The second trailer debuted on March 12, 1999, with the film *Wing Commander*. Again, many fans paid full theater admission to watch the new trailer.[98] A bootlegged version of the preview was leaked to the Internet the same day.[99] The next morning, the trailer was released on the film's official website and shortly afterwards the servers became overloaded.[100] This trailer had over 1 million downloads within its first 24 hours of release, setting a record for the most downloaded trailer until it was surpassed by *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* in April 2000.[101][102] The theatrical trailer caused even more media attention because it was premiered in theaters and screened at the ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas,[103] and was aired on *Entertainment Tonight* and *Access Hollywood*.[99]\n\n\nThe teaser poster, featuring Anakin with his shadow forming Darth Vader's silhouette, was released on November 10, 1998. After Lucas opted for a drawn theatrical poster, Drew Struzan, the artist responsible for the Special Edition posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the poster was unveiled on March 11, 1999. Lucasfilm dictated that, contractually, Struzan's illustration was the only art the foreign distributors could use, and other than the text, it could not be modified in any way.[104] The film also reused the *Godzilla* slogan on teaser posters.[105]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nA novelization was written by Terry Brooks, who met with Lucas before writing the book and received his approval and guidance. It includes some scenes that are not in the film and foreshadows pending developments in the following two installments of the series.[106] Additionally, a Scholastic junior novelization was written by Patricia C. Wrede.[107] A four-issue comic book adaptation was written by Henry Gilroy and published by Dark Horse Comics.[108] The film was again adapted as part of the all-ages *Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy \u2013 A Graphic Novel*, released by Disney-Lucasfilm Press in 2017.[109]\n\n\nA LucasArts video game adaptation was released for the PlayStation and PC.[110] The podracing tie-in *Star Wars Episode I: Racer* was released for Nintendo 64, PC and other platforms. A pinball machine was created by WMS Industries.[111]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe release of the first new *Star Wars* film in 16 years was accompanied by a considerable amount of attention.[112] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, so many workers announced plans to view the premiere that many companies closed on the opening day.[113] Queue areas formed outside cinema theaters over a month before ticket sales began.[114] More theater lines appeared when it was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two weeks into the release. This was because of a fear that family theater-goers would be either unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher prices for them. Instead, tickets were to be sold on a first-come-first-served basis.[115] However, after meetings with the National Association of Theatre Owners, Lucasfilm agreed to allow advance ticket sales on May 12, 1999, provided there was a limit of 12 tickets per customer.[116] As a result, some advance tickets were sold by scalpers at prices as high as US$100 apiece, which a distribution chief called \"horrible\" and said was exactly what they wanted to avoid.[117] *Daily Variety* reported that theater owners received strict instructions from Lucasfilm that the film could only play in the cinema's largest auditorium for the first 8\u201312 weeks, no honor passes were allowed for the first eight weeks, and they were obliged to send their payments to distributor 20th Century Fox within seven days.[118]\n\n\nDespite worries about the film being finished on time, two weeks before its theatrical release, Lucasfilm moved the release date from May 21 to 19, 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, Lucas said the change was intended to give the fans a \"head start\" by allowing them to view it during the week and allowing families to view it during weekends. Eleven charity premieres were staged across the United States on May 16, 1999; receipts from the Los Angeles event, where corporate packages were available for between US$5,000 and US$25,000; proceeds were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.[119] Other charity premieres included the Dallas premiere for the Children's Medical Center, the Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research at the Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, the Big Brother/Sister Association of the Philadelphia premiere, and the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. A statement said that tickets were sold at US$500 apiece and that certain sections of the theaters were set aside for disadvantaged children.[120]\n\n\nThe film had its UK premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event held in aid of the Film & TV Charity, on the 14th July, 1999 at the ODEON Leicester Square. This event was attended by Charles III and helped to raise \u00a3225,000 for the charity.[121]\n\n\nThe film opened at 12:01 am on Wednesday, May 19, 1999, in 2,010 theaters in the United States and Canada. An additional 960 theaters screened the film later in the day. About 120 theaters showed the film continuously on opening day, including the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City and the Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[122] Foreshadowing his future conversion to digital cinematography, Lucas said the film would be released on four digital projectors (two in New York and two in Los Angeles) on June 18, 1999.[123] Few film studios released films during the same week: DreamWorks and Universal Studios released *The Love Letter* on May 21 and *Notting Hill* on May 28, respectively.[124] *The Love Letter* was a commercial failure but *Notting Hill* fared better and followed *The Phantom Menace* closely in second place.[125] Employment consultant firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 2.2 million full-time employees missed work to attend the film, resulting in a US$293 million loss of productivity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison between the puppet of Yoda, present in the original 1999 theatrical and 2001 DVD releases, and the computer-generated model, present in the 2011 Blu-ray Disc and 3D releases\nThe film was released on VHS on April 4, 2000. There were two versions of the film, which were a standard pan and scan version and a widescreen Collector's Edition version. In its first two days of availability, the regular version sold 4.5 million copies and the limited edition sold 500,000.[126] A year later on June 19, 2001, it was announced that *The Phantom Menace* would become the first *Star Wars* film to be officially released on DVD, in a slightly extended cut from the theatrical releases.[127] This THX certified two-disc DVD release debuted on October 16 of the same year.[128] The first disc contains the film and the second disc contains special features. On the first disc, there are three randomized selected menus themed to the planets Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant.[129] There is an Easter egg located in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[130] The special features include seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, a commentary track featuring Lucas and producer Rick McCallum, and several documentaries\u2014including a full-length documentary entitled *The Beginning: Making Episode I*.[129][131] There are also DVD-ROM features, including trailers for *Attack of the Clones*.[132] *The Phantom Menace* became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the United States; 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.[133][134] This surpassed the previous record held by *The Mummy Returns*, which sold 2 million copies within its first week.[135] Less than a month later, *The Phantom Menace*'s record for being the fastest-selling DVD was taken by *Shrek* when it sold 2.5 million copies in its first three days.[136] *The Phantom Menace* was one of the only four films to sell over 2 million DVD copies during their first weeks of release at the time, with the others being *The Mummy Returns*, *Shrek* and *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[137] The film would overall earn $45 million from its first week DVD sales, more than the theatrical releases of *From Hell*, *Riding in Cars with Boys*, *Training Day* and other post-9/11 films.[133]\n\n\nAt the 5th Annual DVD awards, *The Phantom Menace* won four categories: Viewers' Choice Award, Best Menu Design, Best Authoring and Best Audio Presentation, with the latter award being tied with *Pearl Harbor*.[138]\n\n\nThe DVD version was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.[139] A LaserDisc version of *The Phantom Menace* was released in Japan on April 7, 2000, a year and a half before it was available on DVD in the U.S.[140] The *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011;[141] *The Phantom Menace* was restored to improve the picture quality and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8% of the picture to the frame.[142] In the Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.[143]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *The Phantom Menace* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[144]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued *The Phantom Menace* on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on September 22, 2019.[145] Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.[146] This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.[147]\n\n\n\n### 3D re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010, it was announced that all six films in the series would be stereo-converted to 3D. These would be re-released in episode order, beginning with *The Phantom Menace*, which was released to cinemas on February 10, 2012.[148] Prime Focus Limited did the conversion under the supervision of ILM.[149] However, the 3D re-releases of Episodes *II\u2013VI* were postponed or canceled after Lucasfilm was bought by The Walt Disney Company, who decided to focus on the development of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[150]\n\n\nLucas stated the 3D re-release was \"just a conversion\" of the film's 2011 Blu-ray release and no additional changes were made.[151] Only a change to Anakin's magnetic wand during the podrace scene\u2014its tip was sharpened to more accurately fit the original 2D photography to the new 3D image\u2014was confirmed.[152]\n\n\nGeneral Mills and Brisk were promotional partners in North America for the 3D re-release but promotion was limited.[153][154] The film was extensively promoted in Japan; promotional products were sold by 7-Eleven, Domino's Pizza, Pepsi and Gari-Gari Kun.[155] Kellogg's promoted the film internationally,[156][157] and French restaurant Quick launched three *Star Wars*-themed burgers. Lucasfilm also partnered with Variety, the Children's Charity to raise funds for children through the sale of a special edition badge.[158]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFollowing an advance screening on Saturday, May 8, 1999, several newspapers broke an agreement with Fox and published reviews of the film on Sunday, May 9. In a front-page review, the *Los Angeles Daily News* gave it 3\u00bd stars calling it \"pretty good\" overall and \"outstanding in many parts\". The *New York Daily News* was less positive, giving it 2\u00bd stars. *Variety* also made its review by Todd McCarthy available on the Sunday[159] with McCarthy calling it \"the most widely anticipated and heavily hyped film of modern times\" but said that the film \"can scarcely help being a letdown on some levels, but it's too bad that it disappoints on so many\" and that \"it is neither captivating nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull, as well as the sense of wonder and awe that marks the best works of sci-fi/fantasy\".[160]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 237 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Burdened by exposition and populated with stock characters, *The Phantom Menace* gets the *Star Wars* prequels off to a bumpy\u2014albeit visually dazzling\u2014start.\"[161] As of July 2022, the film is the lowest-rated live-action film of the *Star Wars* series dropping below *The Rise of Skywalker*.[162] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[163] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[164]\n\n\nMany aspects of the script and characters were criticized, especially that of Jar Jar Binks, who was regarded by many members of the older fan community as toyetic\u2014a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character.[165][166] Ahmed Best had later said that he contemplated suicide after receiving backlash for his portrayal.[167] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* described Binks as \"a major miscue, a comic-relief character who's frankly not funny\".[168] Drew Grant of *Salon* wrote, \"Perhaps the absolute creative freedom director George Lucas enjoyed while dreaming up the flick's 'comic' relief\u2014with no studio execs and not many an independently minded actor involved\u2014is a path to the dark side.\"[169]\n\n\nConversely, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking\" and said, \"Lucas tells a good story.\" Ebert also wrote that, \"If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable\" because it is the opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than *Star Trek* films, filmmakers could \"[g]ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day\".[170] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film a \"B\" grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes.[171] In an *Entertainment Weekly* review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a \"C\u2212\", calling it \"haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile\".[172] ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote, \"Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, *The Phantom Menace* is still among the best 'bang for a buck' fun that can be had in a movie theater,\" and said the film was a \"distinct improvement\" over *Return of the Jedi*.[173]\n\n\nAndrew Johnston of *Time Out New York* wrote, \"Let's face it: no film could ever match the expectations some have for *Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace*. Which isn't to say it's a disappointment: on the contrary, it's awesomely entertaining, provided you accept it on its own terms\u00a0...\u00a0Like the original film, it's a Boy's Own adventure yarn with a corny but irresistible spiritual subtext. The effects and production design are stunning, but they always serve the story, not the other way around.\"[174] Susan Wloszczyna of *USA Today* said that the film does \"plenty right\" and praised the characters Darth Maul and Watto.[175] David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com said that the film's better moments \"don't merely balance out the weaker ones\u2014they topple them\".[176] Colin Kennedy of *Empire* magazine said that despite problems with pacing and writing, \"there is still much pleasure to be had watching our full-blown Jedi guides in action\". He praised the visuals and Liam Neeson's performance and said that the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi is \"the saga's very best lightsaber battle\".[177]\n\n\n*Empire* magazine ranked *The Phantom Menace* on its list of \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\",[178] while *Entertainment Weekly* and Comcast included the film on their lists of the worst movie sequels.[179][180] James Berardinelli wrote, \"*The Phantom Menace* was probably the most overhyped motion picture of the last decade (if not longer), and its reputation suffered as a result of its inability to satisfy unreasonable expectations.\"[181] William Arnold of the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* agreed that the film's massive hype caused many of the negative reactions, saying, \"it built expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled [the] element of storytelling surprise\". He also said that the film was \"well made and entertaining\" and was much better than similar box office fare released around that year, such as *The Mummy* and *The Matrix*.[182] Ewan McGregor said in 2002 that he was \"slightly disappointed\" that the film was \"kind of flat\" and believed the next film in the franchise would have \"much more humor and...color.\"[183]\n\n\nThe introduction of midi-chlorians\u2014microscopic organisms that mediate use of the Force\u2014has been regarded as controversial.[184] Some viewed it as a concept that negates the Force's spiritual quality. Film historian Daniel Dinello says, \"Anathema to *Star Wars* fanatics who thought they reduced the Force to a kind of viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy.\"[185] Religion expert John D. Caputo writes, \"In the 'Gospel according to Lucas', a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled\u00a0...\u00a0The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis, even if its ways are mysterious: their bodily cells have a heavier than usual concentration of 'midi-chlorians'.\"[186]\n\n\nThere has been some controversy over whether several alien characters reflect racial stereotypes. For example, the oafish, slow-witted Jar Jar Binks has long droopy ears reminiscent of dreadlocks and spoke with what many perceived as a Caribbean patois reminiscent of Jamaican Creole.[187] Drew Grant describes the character as \"[s]ervile and cowardly\u00a0...\u00a0a black minstrel-ish stereotype on par with Stepin Fetchit.\"[169] Georgetown University professor of African-American studies Michael Eric Dyson says that the entire Gungan species seems suggestive of a primitive African tribe, with Boss Nass portrayed as \"a fat, bumbling ... caricature of a stereotypical African tribal chieftain.\"[165] The greedy and corrupt Neimoidians of the Trade Federation have been noted as resembling East Asian stereotypes,[188] and the unprincipled trader Watto has been interpreted as a Jewish stereotype reminiscent of Charles Dickens' character Fagin.[189] Lucas has denied all of these implications,[165] instead criticizing the American media for using opinions from the Internet as a reliable source for news stories. Lucas added that it reflects more the racism of the commenters than it does the movie;[190] however, animator Rob Coleman said ahead of the film's release that Watto's mannerisms were inspired by footage of Alec Guinness as Fagin in *Oliver Twist*.[191]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nEven though it received mixed reviews, *The Phantom Menace* was a financial success, breaking many box office records in its debut, and beating out *The Mummy* by taking number 1. The film broke *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*'s records for the largest single-day gross for taking more than $28 million in the opening day and fastest to gross $100 million in five days. Additionally, it grossed $64.8 million in its opening weekend, the second highest ever at the time, behind *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*.[192] It also became the quickest film to reach the $200 million and $300 million marks, surpassing *Independence Day* (1996) and *Titanic* (1997), respectively.[193][194] *The Phantom Menace* held both records before *Spider-Man* took them in 2002.[195][196] It would go on to earn $105.7 million, making it the highest five-day Wednesday opening weekend of all time.[192] The film had the biggest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film for two years until 2001 when it was taken by *Planet of the Apes*.[197] Its opening day record was handed to *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* that same year.[198] Two years later in 2003, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* surpassed *The Phantom Menace* for having the largest five-day Wednesday opening weekend.[199] During its second weekend, *The Phantom Menace* made $51.3 million, making it the highest-grossing second weekend at the time, surpassing *Jurassic Park*. The film would hold this record until it was surpassed a year later by *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[200] In total, the film stayed at the top of the box office for three weeks until it was overtaken by *Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me* during its fourth weekend.[201] *The Phantom Menace* was 1999's most successful film, staying in the Top 10 until August 5 (11 weeks total), earning $431.1 million in the United States and Canada.[202] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 84.8 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[203]\n\n\nThe film set an opening record in Japan, grossing $12.2 million in its first two days from 403 screens.[204] In the UK, the film also set an opening record with \u00a39.5 million in its opening weekend (including previews), surpassing *Men in Black*.[205][206] It would go on to hold this record until it was taken by *Toy Story 2* a few months later.[207] *The Phantom Menace* also grossed a record $11 million in its opening weekend in Germany.[208] Outside the United States and Canada, the film grossed over $10 million in Australia ($25.9 million), Brazil ($10.4 million), France and Algeria ($43 million), Germany ($53.9 million), Italy ($12.9 million), Japan ($109.9 million), Mexico ($12 million), Spain ($25 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($81.9 million).[209] Its overseas total was $493.2 million, taking its worldwide total to $924.3 million.[202] At that time, the film was the third-highest-grossing film in North America behind *Titanic* and *Star Wars* (1977), and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide behind *Titanic* without adjusting for inflation of ticket prices. When adjusted for ticket price inflation, it ranked as the 19th-highest-grossing film domestically, making it the fourth *Star Wars* film to be in the Inflation-Adjusted Top 20.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter its 3D re-release in 2012, the worldwide box office gross exceeded $1 billion.[210] Although in the intervening years, the film had lost some of its rankings in the lists of highest-grossing films, the 3D re-release returned it to the worldwide all-time Top 10 for several months.[211] In North America, its revenues overtook those of the original *Star Wars* as the saga's highest-grossing film when not adjusting for inflation of ticket prices, and is the tenth-highest-grossing film in North America as of August\u00a02017[update].[212] In North America, its ranking on the Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation list climbed to 16th place\u2014one place behind *Return of the Jedi*.[213] The 3D re-release, which premiered in February 2012, earned $43 million\u2014$22.5 million of which was in North America\u2014worldwide.[214] The 3D re-release earned US$102,727,119 worldwide\u2014including $43.5 million in North America\u2014and has increased the film's overall box office takings to $474.5 million domestically, and $552.5 million in other territories.[215] The film's earnings exceeded $1 billion worldwide on February 22, 2012, making it the first *Star Wars* film and the 11th film in history\u2014excluding inflation\u2014to do so.[210][215]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Shawn Murphy and John Midgley); all of which went to *The Matrix*.[216][217] The film won Saturn Awards for Best Costumes and Best Special Effects,[218] the MTV Movie Award for Best Action Scene,[219] and a Young Artist Award for Jake Lloyd's performance.[220] It was also nominated for\u2014among others\u2014the BAFTAs for Visual Effects and Sound,[221] and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.[222] The film did however receive seven Golden Raspberry Award (Razzie) nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor (Jake Lloyd as Anakin), Worst Supporting Actress (Sofia Coppola as Sach\u00e9), Worst Screen Couple (Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman), and Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best won the Worst Supporting Actor category.[223]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\nA sequel, *Attack of the Clones*, was released in 2002.[224] The story continues a decade later with Anakin grown to adulthood, played by Hayden Christensen.[225][226] A second sequel, *Revenge of the Sith*, was released in 2005 and culminates with Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader.[227]\n\n\nA month after the film's release, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic released the parody song and music video \"The Saga Begins\", in which he interprets the film's plot from Obi-Wan's point of view to the tune of \"American Pie\"; this was included as a bonus feature on a 2011 *Star Wars* Blu-ray.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2018 *Saturday Night Live* comedy rap video, Natalie Portman reprised her appearance as Queen Amidala from *The Phantom Menace* and defended the prequel trilogy.[228]\n\n\nThe film is known for starting the Lego Star Wars toyline and has become one of Lego's most successful licensed brands.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDarth Maul's lightsaber-fighting style served as the inspiration for the 2003 viral video *Star Wars Kid*. Maul, who appears to die in *The Phantom Menace*, was resurrected for the animated series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*, and he also appears on *Star Wars Rebels* and in *Solo: A Star Wars Story*. In 2012, IGN named Maul the 16th-greatest *Star Wars* character.[229] A similar weapon to his dual-bladed lightsaber appears in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*.[230]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The DVD released in 2001 extends the film by about three minutes, giving it a run time of 136 minutes.[*citation needed*]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Later titled *Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope*\n3. **^** The 2008 animated television series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* establishes that Maul survived.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\".

          "content": "\"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace\" is a 1999 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the fourth film in the Star Wars series and the first film of the prequel trilogy. The story is set 32 years before the original trilogy and follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they protect Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. They are joined by Anakin Skywalker, a young slave with strong natural powers of the Force, and contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.\n\nThe film stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August, and Frank Oz. It was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The film was released on May 19, 1999, and received mixed reviews, with praise for its visual effects but criticism for its exposition and characters, particularly Jar Jar Binks. Despite this, it was a box-office success, grossing over $1 billion worldwide.\n\nThe plot involves the Trade Federation blockading the planet Naboo, leading to an invasion. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to negotiate but are attacked and escape to Naboo. They rescue Queen Amidala and flee to the Republic capital planet of Coruscant. Along the way, they meet Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine, who is believed to be the prophesied \"Chosen One.\" The film culminates in a battle on Naboo, where Anakin helps destroy the Federation's control ship, and Qui-Gon is killed by Darth Maul, who is then defeated by Obi-Wan.\n\nThe film's production involved extensive use of digital effects, and it marked Lucas' return to directing after a 22-year hiatus. The film's score was composed by John Williams, featuring the notable track \"Duel of the Fates.\" The film was re-released in 3D in 2012, further boosting its box office gross. It has since become a significant part of the Star Wars franchise, leading to sequels and various adaptations in other media.",

The films are listed by in-year release, rather than the gross they accumulated during a calendar year.[1]\n\n\nSix different directors have directed the highest-grossing film on multiple occasions: George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Sam Raimi, Robert Zemeckis, and Chris Columbus. Spielberg has the record, directing four of the yearly highest-grossing films: *Raiders of the Lost Ark* (1981), *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982), *Jurassic Park* (1993), and *Saving Private Ryan* (1998). Lucas has directed three such films, all of which are part of the *Star Wars* franchise, which he created: the original *Star Wars* (1977), and two of its prequels *The Phantom Menace* (1999), and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005). James Cameron has also directed three such films: *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), *Titanic* (1997), and *Avatar* (2009). Sam Raimi, Robert Zemeckis and Chris Columbus have directed two each: *Spider-Man* (2002) and *Spider-Man 3* (2007) for Raimi; *Back to the Future* (1985) and *Forrest Gump* (1994) for Zemeckis; *Home Alone* (1990) and *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (2001) for Columbus.\n\n\nFilms that are a part of larger film or media franchises are frequently atop the highest-grossing films in the United States. The *Star Wars* franchise has had the highest-grossing film in 8 different years since 1977. In addition to the five aforementioned which Lucas directed, the franchise has also had *The Force Awakens*, *Rogue One*, and *The Last Jedi* (2015\u20132017, respectively), top a year. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has had four films atop the yearly U.S. box office: *The Avengers* (2012), *Black Panther* (2018), *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), and *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021). *No Way Home* also gave the Spider-Man film franchise its third leading film. Batman films, *Harry Potter*, *Top Gun*, and *Toy Story* are the other franchises with two films to top the U.S. box office in a single year.\n\n\n\n## By in-year release[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the annual listing:\n\n\n\nDenotes current record\n\nDenotes former record\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Gross\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1977 | *Star Wars* | $221,280,994\n | [2] |\n| 1978 | *Grease* | $159,978,870\n | [3] |\n| 1979 | *Kramer vs. Kramer* | $106,260,000\n | [4] |\n| 1980 | *The Empire Strikes Back* | $209,398,025\n | [2] |\n| 1981 | *Raiders of the Lost Ark* | $212,222,025\n | [5] |\n| 1982 | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $359,197,037\n | [6] |\n| 1983 | *Return of the Jedi* | $252,583,617\n | [7] |\n| 1984 | *Beverly Hills Cop* | $234,760,478\n | [8] |\n| 1985 | *Back to the Future* | $210,609,762\n | [9] |\n| 1986 | *Top Gun* | $176,781,728\n | [10] |\n| 1987 | *Three Men and a Baby* | $167,780,960\n | [11] |\n| 1988 | *Rain Man* | $172,825,435\n | [12] |\n| 1989 | *Batman* | $251,188,924\n | [13] |\n| 1990 | *Home Alone* | $285,761,243\n | [14] |\n| 1991 | *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* | $204,843,345\n | [15] |\n| 1992 | *Aladdin* | $217,350,219\n | [16] |\n| 1993 | *Jurassic Park* | $357,067,947\n | [17] |\n| 1994 | *Forrest Gump* | $329,694,499\n | [18] |\n| 1995 | *Toy Story* | $191,796,233\n | [19] |\n| 1996 | *Independence Day* | $306,169,268\n | [20] |\n| 1997 | *Titanic* | $600,788,188\n | [21] |\n| 1998 | *Saving Private Ryan* | $216,540,909\n | [22] |\n| 1999 | *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace* | $431,088,295\n | [23] |\n| 2000 | *How the Grinch Stole Christmas* | $260,044,825\n | [24] |\n| 2001 | *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* | $317,575,550\n | [25] |\n| 2002 | *Spider-Man* | $403,706,375\n | [26] |\n| 2003 | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | $377,027,325\n | [27] |\n| 2004 | *Shrek 2* | $441,226,247\n | [28] |\n| 2005 | *Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith* | $380,270,577\n | [29] |\n| 2006 | *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* | $423,315,812\n | [30] |\n| 2007 | *Spider-Man 3* | $336,530,303\n | [31] |\n| 2008 | *The Dark Knight* | $533,345,358\n | [32] |\n| 2009 | *Avatar* | $749,766,139\n | [33] |\n| 2010 | *Toy Story 3* | $415,004,880\n | [34] |\n| 2011 | *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* | $381,011,219\n | [35] |\n| 2012 | *The Avengers* | $623,357,910\n | [36] |\n| 2013 | *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* | $424,668,047\n | [37] |\n| 2014 | *American Sniper* | $350,126,372\n | [38] |\n| 2015 | *Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens* | $936,662,225\n | [39] |\n| 2016 | *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story* | $532,177,324\n | [40] |\n| 2017 | *Star Wars: Episode VIII \u2013 The Last Jedi* | $620,181,382\n | [41] |\n| 2018 | *Black Panther* | $700,059,566\n | [42] |\n| 2019 | *Avengers: Endgame* | $858,373,000\n | [43] |\n| 2020 | *Bad Boys For Life* | $206,305,244\n | [44] |\n| 2021 | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $804,793,477\n | [45] |\n| 2022 | *Top Gun: Maverick*  | $718,732,821\n | [46] |\n| 2023 | *Barbie* | $636,048,475\n | [47] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Domestic Yearly Box Office\".

It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Tomas Arana, Ralf M\u00f6ller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.\n\n\nInspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book *Those About to Die* (formerly titled *The Way of the Gladiator*), the script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks, and Ridley Scott signed-on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999 and wrapped-up in May of that year, after having experienced a range of problems due to the script being unfinished. Several members of the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the nineteen-week shoot in Fort Ricasoli, Malta, forcing many rewrites. Production complications were further exacerbated when Oliver Reed died of a heart attack before production was finished; British post-production company The Mill, whom oversaw the film's CGI effects, were then tasked with creating a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character, Proximo.\n\n\nDespite its troubled production, *Gladiator* was anticipated to be one of the year's most successful films; upon its release, the film grossed over $503 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2000 (behind *Mission: Impossible 2*). Critics praised the acting\u2014particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances\u2014Scott's direction, the visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score, and the production values, although its somewhat dark and brooding tone was criticised by some. Earning numerous accolades, *Gladiator* won five Academy Awards at the 73rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe. *Gladiator* is known for having revitalized (or established) the careers of its cast and crew, elevating Crowe to leading man status, and turning Phoenix into a celebrity.\n\n\nSince its release, *Gladiator* has been critically reevaluated. It is now widely considered one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the greatest historical epic films ever made. It has been credited with reinventing the sword-and-sandal genre, after waning in the public eye during the 1960s; the film rekindled interest in films centered around the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and other iconic periods throughout world history. Several films have attempted to emulate *Gladiator*'s visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of success. The film has been analyzed for its themes of revenge, violence, masculinity, and stoicism. In 2021, Scott announced that writing had begun on a sequel,[8] which is scheduled to be released in the US on November 22, 2024.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 180 AD, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Marcus Aurelius informs Commodus; in response, Commodus murders his father.\n\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries.  Slavers find him and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. In Rome, Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death. Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\n\nProximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus and the gladiators live. \n\n\nLucilla, Commodus's sister and Maximus's former lover, visits Maximus in his cell and offers her help, but he refuses. Meanwhile, Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris of Gaul, an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus during the duel, but he prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life. In response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", which angers Commodus. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed. \n\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus, and Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\n\nTo win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After the Praetorians refuse to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, the freedom of his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Senator Gracchus. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in the afterlife. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena.\n\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRussell Crowe (left) in 2017 and Joaquin Phoenix in 2018\n\n* Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A Hispano-Roman legatus forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus.

Even as I went east, going through Turkey, I began to think to myself this must have been a hell of a franchise.\" During a stop in Baghdad, Iraq, he stopped reading a book about the Irish Revolution for another one: Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 novel *Those About to Die.* These experiences planted the seeds of inspiration for a story about gladiators set in the Roman Empire.\n\n\nTwenty-five years later, Franzoni wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's *Amistad,* which was the director's first film for DreamWorks Pictures. Though *Amistad* was only a moderate commercial success, DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni's screenplay and gave him a three-picture deal as writer and co-producer. Remembering his 1972 trip, Franzoni pitched his Roman history idea to Spielberg, who immediately told him to write the script.[10]\n\n\nIn the first draft, dated April 4, 1998, Franzoni chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ancient Roman text *Historia Augusta*. He later named his protagonist Narcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Emperor Commodus to death.[12]\n\n\n\n![Several dead men and various scattered weapons are located in a large arena.

Parkes and Douglas Wick. They showed him a copy of Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me's 1872 painting entitled *Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)*.[13] Scott was enticed by the idea of filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, he felt Franzoni's dialogue lacked subtlety and hired John Logan to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's desire for revenge.[14]\n\n\nWhile the script was being revised and the production crew was being assembled, DreamWorks began circling several potential partners to help cover the film's budget and costs. Co-financing between studios became increasingly common during the late-1990s as production and marketing costs and the potential for losses spiralled upward.[15] DreamWorks saw success with its split-rights deals as the studio shared financing and distribution for the 1998 films *Saving Private Ryan* and *Deep Impact* with Paramount Pictures. On November 12, 1998, *Variety* reported that Universal Pictures reached a deal with DreamWorks to help finance the film, as well as obtain international distribution rights and split worldwide proceeds 50\u201350 with DreamWorks, which would distribute the film in North America.[15]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oliver Reed (pictured in 1968) portrayed Proximo.\nWhile writing the script, Franzoni expressed interest in Antonio Banderas as the lead role, but he declined. Mel Gibson, Tom Sizemore, and Tom Cruise were considered for the film, but the producers and studio had Russell Crowe at the top of their list after his breakout performance in *L.A. Confidential* (1997).[16] Crowe was initially hesitant to join the project due to gaining forty pounds for *The Insider* (1999)*,* but director Michael Mann convinced the actor to take the role.[17] He eventually signed on to play the main character in September 1998.[18] Crowe would later state that he was pitched by Parkes with the script still unfinished. In his interview for *Inside the Actors Studio*: \"They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman general.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.\"[19]\n\n\nJude Law auditioned for the role of Commodus, but Scott landed his number-one choice, Joaquin Phoenix.[20] Jennifer Lopez reportedly lobbied for the role of Lucilla, but lost out to Connie Nielsen.[20] Crowe initially suggested his *Insider* costar Christopher Plummer prior to Richard Harris being cast in the role of Marcus Aurelius. From there, Ralf M\u00f6ller, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, and Tommy Flanagan joined the cast as pre-production was ready to commence.\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot.[21] Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England.[22] All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to the high costs and unavailability of the items.[23]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nScott and Franzoni drew on several influences for Gladiator, including *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, *La Dolce Vita* and *The Conformist*. The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s Hollywood films of the sword-and-sandal genre, *The Fall of the Roman Empire* and *Spartacus*,[24] and shares several plot points with *The Fall of the Roman Empire*, which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in *Gladiator*, is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In *The Fall of the Roman Empire* a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned. In *Gladiator,* Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. \n\n\nIn the course of *The Fall of the Roman Empire,* Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in *Gladiator*, when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him, too. Livius and Maximus both kill Commodus in single combat for the greater good of Rome in addition to personal motivations: Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his family.\n\n\nScott cited *Spartacus* and *Ben-Hur* as influences on the film: \"These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years\u00a0\u2013 if not all recorded history\u00a0\u2013 the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.\"[25]\n\n\n*Spartacus* provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator, bearing the name of a pair of revolutionary tribunes from the 2nd century BC, who in both films is an elder statesman of ancient Rome attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious autocrat\u00a0\u2013 Marcus Licinius Crassus in *Spartacus* and Commodus in *Gladiator.* Both actors who played Gracchus (in *Spartacus* and *Gladiator*) played Claudius in previous films: Charles Laughton of *Spartacus* played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film *I, Claudius* and Derek Jacobi of *Gladiator* played Claudius in the 1976 BBC adaptation. Both films also share a specific set piece wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, Woody Strode's Draba in *Spartacus*) throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: \"Rome is the mob\", said here by Gracchus and by Julius Caesar (John Gavin) in *Spartacus*.\n\n\n\n## Filming[edit]\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nThe film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes set in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the Bourne Woods, near Farnham, Surrey, in England.[26] When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down.[27] Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a 45-degree shutter,[7] creating stop motion effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[28]\n\n\nThe scenes of slavery, desert travel, and the gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks.[29] To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena.[30] The scenes set in Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta.[31][32]\n\n\nIn Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built to a height of 52 feet (16 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood. The other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally.[33] The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.[34] The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, colonnades, gates, statuary, and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented \"costume villages\" that had to change rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities.[31] The rest of the Colosseum was created in computer-generated imagery using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in Flame and Inferno software.[35]\n\n\nWhile Crowe and Harris became good friends during filming, the actor did not get along with Reed. In a 2010 interview with *GQ*, Crowe stated that he \"never got on with Ollie. He has visited me in dreams and asked me to talk kindly of him. So I should... but we never had a pleasant conversation.\" Crowe was uncomfortable with Reed's excessive drinking during filming. Phoenix was initially anxious about filming and requested Scott he drop out early in production. To help calm the then 25-year-old Phoenix's nerves, Crowe and Harris decided to get him drunk. \"It was actually Richard Harris' idea,\" Crowe later recalled, \"because Joaquin was very nervous on the set and I went to Richard and said, 'Mate, what are we gonna do with this kid, he's asking me to abuse him before takes.'\"[36]\n\n\n\n### Script revisions and complaints[edit]\n\n\nThroughout filmmaking, the actors complained about problems with the script. William Nicholson was brought to Shepperton Studios to make Maximus a more sensitive character. Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying, \"he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.\"[14] The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions, with several actors providing changes.[37] Crowe questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to Nicholson, Crowe reportedly told him that his \"lines are garbage, but I'm the greatest actor in the world and I can make even garbage sound good.\"\n\n\nAccording to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.\"[38] Crowe described the script situation: \"I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\"[19]\n\n\nCrowe threatened to kill Lustig with his bare hands due to him refusing to pay his assistants.[39]\n\n\nOf the writing and filming process, Crowe added, \"Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my 'volatility' has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it\u2013 what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.\"[19]\n\n\nMaximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer.[40] In a conversation with Marcus Aurelius, Maximus says the fecund soil of his farm is \"black like my wife's hair\".[40] Crowe wrote the speech himself, drawing on his feelings of homesickness for his own farm.[40]\n\n\n\n### Injuries[edit]\n\n\nCrowe was injured during principal photography. Detailing the impact filming had on his body during his appearance on *Inside the Actor's Studio,* Crowe described that there was a \"lot of blood, lot of blood, lot of grazes, you know, I mean, I've still got, a lot of little scar[s] here and one under here on this elbow, a discoloration of the skin that is directly to Gladiator\".[41] During filming on the sequence where Maximus fights Tigris of Gaul in the arena with tigers, Crowe narrowly escaped being clawed by a tiger.[42]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nMen in white robes with the Colosseum in the background.Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome.\nBritish post-production company The Mill was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company used such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on bluescreen into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming. They also used 2,000 live actors to create a computer-generated crowd of 35,000 virtual actors that had to look believable and react to fight scenes.[33] The Mill accomplished this by shooting live actors at different angles giving various performances, and then mapping them onto cards, with motion-capture tools used to track their movements for three-dimensional compositing.[35] The Mill created over 90 visual effects shots, comprising approximately nine minutes of the film's running time.[43]\n\n\nAn unexpected post-production job was required because of the death of Oliver Reed during the filming in Malta before all his scenes had been shot. The Mill created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character Proximo[35] by photographing a live-action body double in the shadows and by performing digital face replacement by mapping a three-dimensional computer-generated image of Reed's face to the remaining scenes during production at an estimated cost of $3.2 million for two minutes of additional footage.[44][45] Visual effects supervisor John Nelson reflected on the decision to include the additional footage: \"What we did was small compared to our other tasks on the film. What Oliver did was much greater. He gave an inspiring, moving performance. All we did was help him finish it.\"[44] The film is dedicated to Reed's memory.[46]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gladiator (2000 soundtrack)\n\n![](image)\n\nHans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard\u00a0\u2013 \"Now We Are Free\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of *Gladiator*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nThe Oscar-nominated score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist Ofra Haza for the score, after his work with her in *The Prince of Egypt*. However, Haza died in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on *The Insider* score.[47]\n\n\nThe music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to Gustav Holst's \"Mars: The Bringer of War\", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Holst's work.[48][49] The case was settled out of court. [50] Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections\u00a0\u2013 the Prelude to *Das Rheingold* and Siegfried's Funeral March from *G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung*\u00a0\u2013 from Richard Wagner's *Ring of the Nibelung*.\n\n\nOn February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca produced *Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture*. Then, on September 5, 2005, Decca produced *Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition*, a two-CD pack containing both the above-mentioned releases. Some of the music from the film was featured in the NFL playoffs in January 2003 before commercial breaks and before and after half-time.[51] In 2003, Luciano Pavarotti released a recording of himself singing a song from the film and said he regretted turning down an offer to perform on the soundtrack.[52]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 in film\n\n![](image)The logo for *Gladiator*\nThe theatrical year of 1999 achieved a record $7.3 billion at the domestic box office, thanks largely to the success of *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace* and *The Sixth Sense*. Industry executives did not replicate that success with the releases in 2000, however. Increasing production costs and a lack of merchandising forced studios to concentrate marketing on the appeal of popular actors such as Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey, and Bruce Willis to help boost ticket sales and draw in potential female audiences for their slates.[53][54][55]\n\n\nThe action sequel *Mission: Impossible 2* was expected to have the biggest success, while anticipated films such as *Dinosaur*, *Gladiator*, *The Patriot*, and *X-Men* were also expected to perform well.[53][56][57] Films such as *Battlefield Earth*, *Gone in 60 Seconds*, *The Kid*, *Me, Myself & Irene*, *Nutty Professor II: The Klumps*, *The Perfect Storm*, and *What Lies Beneath* were heavily marketed and promoted with the appeal of their leading actors that already had a built-in audience.[54][55] *Gladiator* was expected to perform well following test screenings that DreamWorks conducted between October 1999 and February 2000 that were overwhelmingly positive, but some analysts predicted the film could be impacted by the lack of a built-in audience for Crowe.[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was released in the United States and Canada on May 5, 2000.[61] During its opening weekend, *Gladiator* earned $34.8 million across 2,938 theaters\u2014an average of $11,851 per theater\u2014making it the number one film of the weekend, ahead of *U-571* ($7.8 million), in its first weekend, and *The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas* ($7.6 million), in its second weekend.[62][63] The film not only leapt over *Scream 3* to achieve the year's highest opening weekend, but also earned the third-highest opening weekend for an R-rated film ever, trailing only *Air Force One* (1997) and *Interview with the Vampire* (1994).[64] The film's positive word of mouth and the sex appeal of Crowe helped with bringing in a female audience during its opening weekend, with the percentage of women buying tickets increasing from 35% on its opening day to 45% the following day.[65]\n\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend with $24.6 million, ahead of the debut of *Battlefield Earth* ($11.5 million).[66] During its third weekend, *Gladiator* fell to second place with $19.7 million, behind the debut of *Dinosaur* ($38.5 million).[67][68] By Memorial Day, it had already earned a total of $127.2 million, surpassing *Erin Brockovich* to become the highest-grossing film of the year.[69] Without regaining the number one spot, *Gladiator* spent ten weeks in the top ten at the box office. The film was in theaters for over a year and finished its theatrical run on May 10, 2001.[70] *Gladiator* grossed $187.7 million in the United States and Canada, finishing as the fourth highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($215.4 million), *Cast Away* ($233.6 million), and *How The Grinch Stole Christmas* ($260 million).[71]\n\n\nOutside of North America, *Gladiator* is estimated to have grossed over $272.9 million internationally.[70] This gave the film a cumulative gross of over $503.2 million worldwide against a budget of $103 million.[70] It was the second highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($546.4 million).[70]\n\n\nDue to an increase in ticket prices, 2000 set a new record of $7.7 billion at the domestic box office, exceeding the previous year's $7.31 billion. However, attendance was estimated at being down 2.5% from 1999.[72][73] Industry executives blamed the decrease in attendance on the year's slate for its lack of commercial appeal, a dearth of female-driven films and sleeper hits, as well as several exhibition chains filing for bankruptcy.[74][73] Nevertheless, *Gladiator* was considered to be one of 2000's biggest blockbusters due to strong word of mouth, contributing to its long-lasting box office performance and DreamWorks' improving fortunes.[75][73][74]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nUpon its initial release, *Gladiator* opened to generally positive reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\n\n![](image)Connie Nielsen (pictured here in 2009) was praised by critics, notably the otherwise critical Ebert, for providing depth to the film.\nThe performances and the cast were praised by critics, with Crowe and Phoenix being considered by critics as the main highlights. Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* said Crowe \"solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.\"[76] In his positive review for *The Wall Street Journal*, Joe Morgensten said that Crowe \"doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong,\" and that the film \"rests on Mr. Crowe's armor-clad shoulders, and he carries it remarkably well.\"[77] *Empire*'s Ian Nathan, giving the film four stars, wrote that Phoenix displayed \"gleeful hamminess\" in his performance.[78]\n\n\nWriting about the film as a whole, Nathan expressed that \"while it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.\"[78] Geoff Andrew of *Time Out* praised the film, saying that \"the cast is strong (notably Nielsen as Commodus's vacillating sister, and the late Oliver Reed, unusually endearing as a gladiator owner), the pacing lively, and the sets, swordplay and Scud catapults impressive.[79] Roger Ebert, who was otherwise critical in his two-star review, praised Nielsen for having the most depth in the entire film.[80] On the other hand, Camille Paglia, who called the film \"boring, badly shot and suffused with sentimental p.c. rubbish,\" criticized Crowe and Phoenix's performances[81]\n\n\nScott's directing was generally praised by critics, who called it a return to form for the director. In her A- review for *Entertainment Weekly*, Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Scott's directing, particularly during the opening battle sequence. Schwarzbaum writes that with the battle sequence, \"Scott lets loose his own extraordinary assault. It's a bravura sequence of flaming arrows, falling horses, and mortal combat that doesn't copy *Private Ryan's* famous opening tour de force of carnage so much as raise a banner in admiration. It's Scott the visual artist at his most deluxe.\" Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* wrote that \"Scott really scores in his big Rome set-pieces, especially Crowe's combat with men and tigers in a computer-enhanced Colosseum much bigger and more monumental than the original,\" and that \"for all of its implausible silliness and towering high camp, Scott's movie tells an engaging story, and the central arena fight-sequence in which Maximus and his gladiators playing the doomed Carthaginians end up defeating the Romans and reversing history \"to the emperor's horror\" is wittily and adroitly done: a sly demonstration of the confluence of politics and mass entertainment.\"[82] Michael Wilmington of *The Chicago Tribune* gave praise to Scott's direction, comparing the visual style of the film to that of Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner*.[83]\n\n\nCritics generally praised the production values of the film, with the costumes, production design, and visual effects. Todd McCarthy, praising the film for *Variety*, said *Gladiator* \"revels in both the glory and the horror that were Rome,\" with \"details in Arthur Max's brilliant production design and Janty Yates' highly diversified costume design that offered up in wonderfully offhand fashion,\" while also commanding the \"CGI effects that have allowed numerous sets, notably the Colosseum, to be enhanced in size and spectacle value; the stunts, fights and battles are as forceful and realistic as anyone could want, John Mathieson's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the pacing across 2\u00bd hours is well modulated.\" Ebert criticized the film for looking \"muddy, fuzzy and indistinct.\" In his two-star review, Ebert also derided the writing, saying it \"employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Gladiator\n\nDespite the critical and commercial success it received during its theatrical run, *Gladiator* was not initially considered a major contender for the Academy Awards. When award season talk came around towards the end of 2000, critics and journalists simply viewed the film as an enjoyable summer film, but not a major Oscar contender.[84][85] *Gladiator* and *Erin Brockovich* were singled out for their releases during the first half of the year, while contenders such as *Almost Famous*, *Billy Elliot*, *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Traffic* were released during the fall and winter of 2000 and received awards from numerous critics groups and guild organizations.[85] When the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama at the 58th Golden Globes, media outlets began viewing *Gladiator* as the front runner for the Academy Awards.[86] Its subsequent wins for the BAFTA Award for Best Film and Produces Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture solidified *Gladiator*'s front runner status for the Oscars.[87]\n\n\nWhen nominations for the 73rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 2001, *Gladiator* received the most nominations with twelve, while *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* had scored ten. On March 25, 2001, the film won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Russell Crowe, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Costume Design. It was nominated for an additional seven: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for Joaquin Phoenix and Best Director for Ridley Scott, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Film Editing.[88]\n\n\nIt was the first film to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since *All the King's Men* at the 22nd Academy Awards in 1950. This was also the second consecutive DreamWorks film to achieve an Oscar for Best Picture after *American Beauty* the previous year.[89] Due to Academy rules, only Hans Zimmer was officially nominated for Best Original Score, and not Lisa Gerrard.[90] However, the pair did win the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score as co-composers.[91] Of its one-hundred and nineteen award nominations, *Gladiator* won a total of forty-eight prizes.[92]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Some deviations from historical facts were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were \"too unbelievable\" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out product endorsements in the arena. While this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic. \n\n\nAt least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits, though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, \"where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?\" Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made *Gladiator* less interesting or exciting, stating, \"creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction\".\n\n\n\n### Fictionalization[edit]\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus. He died at Vindobona (modern Vienna) in 180 AD from the Antonine Plague. The epidemic, believed to be either smallpox or measles, swept across the Roman Empire during his reign. There is no indication Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone from that point until his death at the end of 192 AD. The film depicts Marcus as defeating the barbarians in the Marcomannic Wars. In reality, the war was still ongoing when Aurelius died. Commodus secured a peace treaty with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, the Marcomanni and the Quadi, immediately after his father's death.\n\n\nAlthough Commodus did engage in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena. He was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film. In the film, Lucilla is portrayed as a lone widow of Lucius Verus with one son, also named Lucius Verus. While Lucilla was the widow of Verus and also had a son by that name, their son died young, long before the reign of Commodus. \n\n\nLucilla remarried Claudius Pompeianus soon after Verus' death. She had been married to him for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor. Her only living son during this time was Aurelius Pompeianus. The film omits Lucilla's other two children with Verus, Lucilla Plautia and Aurelia Lucilla. Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with her stepson by Pompeianus and several others. She was first exiled to the island of Capri by her brother, then executed on his orders later in the year.\n\n\nThe character of Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles the following historical figures: Narcissus, Commodus's real-life murderer and the character's name in the first draft of the screenplay; Spartacus, who led a significant slave revolt in 73\u201371 BC; Cincinnatus (519\u2013430 BC), a farmer who was made dictator, saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month appointment after 15 days; and Marcus Nonius Macrinus, a trusted general, consul in 154 AD, and friend of Marcus Aurelius. \n\n\nMaximus had a similar career, and personality traits as documented by Herodian, to Claudius Pompeianus, a Syrian who married Marcus Aurelius' daughter Lucilla following the death of Lucius Verus. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as caesar, in preference to Commodus, but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film.\n\n\nIn the film, the character Antonius Proximo claims \"the wise\" Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome, forcing him to move to Mauretania. The real Aurelius banned games, but only in Antioch as punishment for the city's support of the usurper Avidius Cassius. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed *lanistae* such as Proximo to make \"windfall\" profits through increased charges for their services.\n\n\nIn real life, the death of Commodus did not result in peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the Year of the Five Emperors of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax.\n\n\n\"Maximus Decimus Meridius\" does not appear to be a usual personal name during ancient Rome. A more accurate name would be \"Decimus Meridius Maximus\", as \"Decimus\" is a *praenomen* and \"Maximus\" is a *cognomen*. \"Proximo\" should be rendered as \"Proximus.\"\n\n\n\n### Anachronisms[edit]\n\n\n![Reconstructed Roman artillery pieces are used to locate the most likely position of Roman artillery during the battle at the Harzhorn by firing marked projectiles into the historical impact zones.](image)Roman field artillery used in open battle was far more compact and transportable than shown by the film. It was capable of creating \"killing zones\" with a low chance of survival, as proven by tightly spaced impacts on a real battlefield.\nCostumes in the film are rarely historically correct. Some soldiers wear fantasy helmets. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely worn. Their appearance is the product of a cinematic stereotype where historical films depict peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the Imperial Gallic armor and the helmets worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by new designs in AD 100. The legions' standard bearers (aquiliferi), centurions, mounted forces, and auxiliaries would have worn scale armour, lorica squamata. The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the Stone Age period.\n\n\nRoman field artillery was used in combat extensively by the Romans, though within the film they are also depicted as using  onagers, which was not used by the Roman Empire until the 4th century, hundreds of years after the events of the film. The Roman cavalry are shown using stirrups. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the Roman army used a two-horned saddle, without stirrups. Stirrups were only employed in filming for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle.\n\n\nCatapults and ballistae would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for sieges and rarely used in open battles. Fire pots fired from catapults were not used in ancient history.\n\n\nThe Praetorian Guards all wear purple uniforms, no historical evidence supports this. On campaign, they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements.\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was first released on DVD and VHS on November 21, 2000.[93] Along with *X-Men*, both films generated $60 million in home video sales each in their first week.[94] By this point, *Gladiator* had already sold 1.8 million DVD units, making it the fastest-selling DVD release at the time.[95] By January 2001, it broke *The Matrix*'s record for becoming the top-selling DVD release, selling 3.5 million copies.[96] In the United Kingdom, 500,000 copies were sold in 2000 alone.[97] With over 5 million copies sold, the film held the record for being the best-selling DVD title of all time until *Shrek* surpassed it later that year.[98]\n\n\nThe DVD has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the Blu-ray Disc and DVDs include deleted scenes, trailers, documentaries, commentaries, storyboards, image galleries, Easter eggs, and cast auditions. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of Paramount's \"Sapphire Series\".[99] Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with *The Fifth Element* in 2007.[100] A remastered version was later released in 2010.\n\n\nThe DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film-only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc \"extended edition\" DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also selectable via seamless branching, which is not included on the UK edition. The DVD is notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika, and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were repackaged and sold as a two-disc \"special edition\" in the EU in 2005. \n\n\nThe film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Paramount Home Media Distribution in May 2018.[101]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Revenge[edit]\n\n\nA common theme found in *Gladiator* is that of revenge. Throughout the film, Maximus' character arc revolves around exacting revenge against Commodus for betraying him and arranging the deaths of his wife, his son, and the emperor. Writing in the chapter \"*Gladiator* and Contemporary American Society\" of her book *Big Screen Rome*, Monica S. Cyrino argues that Maximus' revenge arc is driven by the alienation of Roman politics.[102] Cyrino opines that Maximus is introduced as being patriotic and one who \"fights for an ideal Rome because, never having been to the city, he has remained undefiled by the reality that Rome is rightful conqueror and civilizing force over the world.[102] Maximus is soon betrayed by Commodus and \"when he finds his wife and son murdered, it marked the moment of his alienation from everything he once valued.\"[102]\n\n\nThe loss of his family and emperor mentally breaks Maximus, who initially refuses to fight with the other gladiators and eventually cuts out the legion tattoo on his arm. This further solidifies Maximus' alienation from Rome. Cyrino notes that \"Maximus' alienation from a degenerate Rome and his deep-seated ambivalence about his role in restoring Roman government to the people suggests a parallel to post-Cold War America,\" because while there was a \"temporary boost in the rhetoric of national unity and superficial displays of patriotism after September 11, 2001, current political and social commentators remark on the apathy of the American electorate, such as low voter turnout and a persistent lack of interest in political debate.\"[102] When Maximus returns to Rome as a slave, \"he eventually realizes what he has already begun to understand: \"The mob is Rome.\"\"[102] Driven by his anger and isolation, Maximus' resolution is to re-enact his ideal of Rome from within the arena. After killing Commodus, Maximus asks Quintus to reinstate Senator Gracchus in the hope that Gracchus will endeavor to implement Marcus Aurelius' ideals.\n\n\n\n### Violence as spectacle[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* comments on the theme of violence in sports and as a spectacle for entertainment. Cyrino writes that \"*Gladiator* evokes the influence of the superstar athlete in a child's wide-eyed worship of celebrity when young Lucius approaches Maximus, his new idol, as he waits in his cell to enter the arena.\"[102] Franzoni himself was inspired by various sports agents and professional sports such as the NFL and WWE when writing the script.[103] Cyrino believes that the film's \"gladiatorial fights are reminiscent of the way in which contemporary sports competitions, especially professional football and wrestling, are filmed for television,\" and that Logan employed a similar tactic in the screenplay for Oliver Stone's *Any Given Sunday* (1999), in which \"the camera watches from a series of vantage points that are easily recognizable to any viewers of Monday Night Football.\"[102] Cyrino argues that the film deconstructs the spectacle of violence through the lens of Maximus. After a victory in Zucchabar, Maximus throws his sword at the local viewing box and spits at the sand after displaying his contempt for the crowd. Cyrino argues that \"the depiction of the Roman mob in Gladiator offers the American audience an unnerving mirror-image of themselves, eager to be entertained at all costs and demanding ever more intricate, dangerous, and realistic spectacles.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Masculinity and stoicism[edit]\n\n\nThemes of masculinity and stoicism are commentated throughout the film's plot. During the course of the film, Maximus is represented as a strong, fearless figure who is brave, loyal, and honest to those around him. Cyrino writes that Maximus' masculinity is defined through his upbringing as a farmer and a working-class hero.[102] A signature trait of Maximus before he fights is that he picks up dirt from the ground and wipes his hands dirty, signaling his status as a man who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Cyrino states that Maximus' portrayal as \"a simple man of the soil responds to modern society's idealization of the countryside and its supposed virtue and purity, in stark contrast to the crime-ridden metropolis.\"[102] Maximus gains the support of his fellow gladiators and some of the Senate over the course of the film through the way he behaves and acts.\n\n\nSome philosophers have noted the role stoicism plays in Maximus' masculinity. The real life Marcus Aurelius writes in *Meditations* that stoics must \"concentrate on [their responsibilities] ... without getting stirred up or meeting anger with angers.\" Maximus' drive for vengeance causes him to turn away from his responsibilities of a role model to his son until Lucilla confronts him in his cell, whereby he realizes that his emotions are getting the better of him. When Commodus taunts Maximus about how his son \"squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross,\" stoicism shines a light on Maximus. Instead of giving in to his anger, Maximus slightly bows and refers to Commodus as \"highness\" instead of \"emperor,\" which later becomes a psychological and emotional blow to Commodus' ego. Krysta Larson, writing in \"Mother Knows Best? Evaluating the Roles of Stoic Parents in *Gladiator*,\" believes that \"if it were stoically proper to continue in one's role as a parent to a dead son, then Maximus would fulfill his role as a good Stoic father by pursuing virtuous goals and properly performing the deeds dictated by his roles rather than seeking revenge.\"[104]\n\n\nCommodus, on the other hand, is presented as the antithesis of Maximus. The film portrays Commodus as an immature, cowardly, and unreasonable man who is not fit for the demands of governing the Roman Empire. He openly complains, sobs, has trouble sleeping at night, and struggles to gain respect from the other characters. The film portrays Commodus as having only a single friend in his sister, with even his father openly admitting that his son is not moral. Driven by the lack of love obtained from his father, Commodus is \"keen to acquire the love and respect of the Roman people that his father had enjoyed but criticizes Marcus Aurelius for his intellectualism.\"[102] Cyrino compared Commodus to the presidency of George W. Bush, stating that like Commodus, \"Bush employed rhetoric imbued with overly emotional and sometimes childish tones.\"[102] Both Commodus and Bush, according to Cyrino, are \"contemptuous of guidance from advisory councils and express their scorn by means of anti-intellectual bluster.\"[102]\n\n\nAs it becomes clear Maximus is winning the respect of the crowd, Commodus becomes irritated and frustrated. When he purposefully taunts Maximus about the deaths of his family, Maximus rebukes him by calling him \"highness\" and that his time of honoring his narcissism will come to an end. This leads to him openly complaining and sobbing to Senator Falco later that night. Commodus' amoral personality intensifies when he begins to lust after his own sister and forces her to become his sex slave as punishment for her betrayal. *Gladiator* highlights the distinct personalities of Maximus and Commodus in the final battle. Prior to their duel, Commodus stabs Maximus in an effort to gain the upper hand, demonstrating his cowardly demeanor. Maximus' honor, determination, and discipline eventually overcomes Commodus' vanity, cruelty, and ambition when he stabs him in the neck.\n\n\n\n### Borrowing of Nazi imagery[edit]\n\n\nThe film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda film *Triumph of the Will* (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the iconography of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. *Gladiator* reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred during Adolf Hitler's procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his chariot.[105] The first thing to appear in *Triumph of the Will* is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene), leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.[106]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A replica of the mask worn by Maximus in *Gladiator* became the basis for the signature mask for British-American rapper MF Doom.\n*Gladiator* has been considered a cultural phenomenon since its release.[103][107][108] Prior to the release of *Gladiator*, the swords and sandal genre had fallen out of public popularity following a string of expensive box office flops such as *Cleopatra* (1963) and *The Fall of the Roman Empire* (1964).[109] In the 1990s, the historical epic genre saw a revival in popularity following the success of films such as *Dances with Wolves* (1990), *Schindler's List* (1993), *Braveheart* (1995), *Titanic* (1997), and *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[110][111] *Gladiator* continued these films' realism with more of a focus on Ancient History, which had not been explored extensively since the 1960s.[110]\n\n\nRetrospective reviews and film critics have noted that *Gladiator*'s success spurred a revival of the historical epic genre with films during the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s such as *The Last Samurai* (2003), *Troy* (2004), *The Alamo* (2004), *King Arthur* (2004), *Alexander* (2004), *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005), *300* (2007) and its sequel *300: Rise of an Empire* (2014), *Centurion* (2010), *Robin Hood* (2010), *The Eagle* (2011), *Exodus: Gods and Kings* (2014), *The Last Duel* (2021), *The Northman* (2022), and *Napoleon* (2023).[112] The gladiator arena set piece from *Star Wars: Episode II\u00a0\u2013 Attack of the Clones* (2002), which entered production shortly after the release of *Gladiator*, has been compared to the arena setting in the film.[113][114][115]\n\n\nWhile a majority of these films were critically and commercially successful in their own right, *The Guardian*'s Steve Rose argued that the historical epic revival devolved back into parody by 2007, as none of the films have recaptured the impact of *Gladiator*. Rose also argued that after twenty years, the film's story was more relevant now than it was then with its themes of populism and fascism.[116] *Cineramble*'s James Humphreys wrote on the film's twentieth anniversary that the swords and sandal epic revival was short-lived because studios and producers focused more on *Gladiator*'s visuals rather than the quality of its storytelling and characters.[111] Humphreys argued that the film influenced several films in the fantasy and superhero film genres more than the historical epic genre itself, with the film's aesthetics helping influence Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001\u20132003), the Marvel Cinematic Universe (2008\u2013present), and the DC Extended Universe (2013\u20132023).[111]\n\n\nThe film's mainstream success was responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. The Cicero biography *Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician* and Gregory Hays's translation of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* received large spikes in sales after the release of the film.[117] According to *The New York Times*, this has been dubbed the \"Gladiator Effect\".\n\n\n\n\n> It's called \"the 'Gladiator' effect\" by writers and publishers. The snob in us likes to believe that it is always books that spin off movies. Yet in this case, it's the movies\u00a0\u2013 most recently *Gladiator* two years ago\u00a0\u2013 that have created the interest in the ancients. And not for more Roman screen colossals, but for writing that is serious or fun or both.[117]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Gladiator'*s effect on culture went beyond cinema. The film influenced numerous television series such as *Rome* (2005\u20132007) and *Game of Thrones* (2011\u20132019).[118] Jack Gleeson based his performance of Joffrey Baratheon in *Game of Thrones* on Phoenix's performance as Commodus.[119] British-American underground hip-hop artist MF Doom's signature mask was inspired by the mask worn by Maximus, having picked up one of the replicas that were sold following the film's success[120] Dialogue such as \"Are You Not Entertained,\" \"Am I Not Merciful,\" \"I Will Have My Vengeance,\" and \"Strength and Honor\" are among the most recognizable quotes and have become the subject of numerous internet memes.[121] In 2009, Maximus was featured on a 55c \"Australian Legends\" postage stamp series, with Crowe attending a ceremony to mark the creation of the stamps.[122]\n\n\nThe film became a touchstone for the careers of its cast and crew. After *Thelma & Louise* (1991), Scott faced a string of critical and commercial flops during the 1990s including *1492: Conquest of Paradise* (1992), *White Squall* (1996), and *G.I. Jane* (1997). *Gladiator* became a reversal of fortune for Scott, earning him his best acclaim and interest since *Thelma and Louise*. In the wake of *Gladiator*'s success, Scott followed up by directing *Hannibal* (2001), the highly anticipated sequel to *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991), and *Black Hawk Down* (2001).[123] *Gladiator*, along with *The Insider*, helped elevate Russell Crowe into an established A-lister and worldwide fame. His performance in *Gladiator* landed him top-billing roles in Ron Howard's *A Beautiful Mind* (2001) and Peter Weir's *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003).[124]\n\n\n\nScott and Crowe collaborated again for *A Good Year* (2006), *American Gangster* (2007), *Body of Lies* (2008), and *Robin Hood* (2010). *Gladiator* brought fame for Phoenix, who was cast by M. Night Shyamalan for the films *Signs* (2002) and *The Village* (2004) and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as the Joker in *Joker* (2019). Harris' performance in *Gladiator* resulted in his casting as Albus Dumbledore in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (2001).[125] Several members of the cast and crew have commented on the impact the film has had on their careers and its cultural legacy. In a 2020 interview with *Yahoo!*, M\u00f6ller remarked that he continues to get recognized by many people for his performance as Hagen.[126] Scott considers the film one of the top three favorite films he has directed.[108] Crowe noted that the quality of the film has helped find new fans on television twenty years after its release.[127] When being interviewed by *Den of Geek* in 2020, Wick said this about the film's impact.\n\n\n> I think if you've been around for a while, one of the things you'll learn is that if you look at a hundred years of movies, every cycle repeats, and it's all about someone who will be able to reinvent it. Every 20 years there'll be a vampire movie, and the 20-year-old versions usually start to look kitsch. Luckily with *Gladiator* that's not the case.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Modern reception[edit]\n\n\nToday, *Gladiator* is considered to be one of the greatest action films ever made, one of the greatest historical epic films ever made, and one of the greatest films of both the 2000s decade and 21st Century.\n\n\nOn their *\"*100 Best Movies Of All Time list\"*, Empire* ranked the film as the thirty-ninth best film ever made, and ranked the film as the twenty-second best film of the 21st Century.[128][129] *Gladiator* was named one of the best films of the 21st Century by *The Guardian*, and was included in Rotten Tomatoes \"The 140 Essential 2000 Movies.\"[130][131]\n\n\n*Den of Geek* and *Collider* both named *Gladiator* as the best historical epic ever made, and one of *The Guardian*'s twenty-five best action and war films.[132][133][134] Numerous websites including *Vulture* and /Film named *Gladiator* in the top ten films from Scott.[135][136]\n\n\nThe film is included in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[137] The American Film Institute included *Gladiator* as one of the four-hundred films nominated for their *AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)* list, while ranking Maximus as the fiftieth greatest hero in film.[138][139] The character of Maximus was placed 12th in the *Total Film* list of 50 best movie heroes and villains[140] and 35th in the *Empire*'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[141]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, *Gladiator* has an approval rating of 80% based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While not everyone will be entertained by *Gladiator*'s glum revenge story, Russell Crowe thunderously wins the crowd with a star-making turn that provides Ridley Scott's opulent resurrection of Rome a bruised heart.\"[142] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[143]\n\n\n\n## Sequel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Gladiator 2*\n\nIn June 2001, developments for a *Gladiator* follow-up began in the form of potential for either a prequel or a sequel, with David Franzoni in early negotiations once again to write the script. [144] The following year, a sequel was announced to be moving forward with John Logan serving as screenwriter. The plot, set fifteen years later, included the Praetorian Guards rule of Rome and an older-aged Lucius searching for the truth about his biological father. Franzoni signed on as producer, alongside Douglas Wick and Walter Parkes.[145] In December 2002, the film's plot was announced to include prequel events regarding the parentage of Lucius, as well as sequel events depicting the resurrection of Maximus. Producers and Russell Crowe collaboratively researched extensively, ancient Roman beliefs regarding the afterlife.[146] By September 2003, Scott announced that the script was completed, while confirming that the story would primarily center around the secret son of Maximus, being Lucius.[147]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Scott stated that while development on the project continues, the exact story of the film has yet to be figured out. The filmmaker stated that all the creative minds that were involved with *Gladiator* are working on how to continue from where the story left off. While Crowe favors a fantasy element that would bring Maximus back to life, Scott believes a grounded historical-fiction approach is the better option. Scott confirmed that Lucius will be revealed as the son of Maximus and Lucilla, while stating that the script will be more complex compared to the first movie with the corruption of Rome.[148]\n\n\nDuring this time, Nick Cave was commissioned to write a new draft of the script which he wrote under the working title of \"Christ Killer\". The writer described the plot as a \"deities vs. deity vs. humanity\" story, where the premise involves Maximus being resurrected as an immortal eternal warrior for the Roman gods, after living in purgatory since his death. The story would follow Maximus, who is sent to Earth and tasked with stopping the momentum of Christianity by killing Jesus Christ and His disciples, as their movement was gradually siphoning off the Pagan power and vitality. During this mission, Maximus is tricked into murdering his own son, and cursed to live forever, fighting amongst: the Crusades, WWII, and the Vietnam War. The ending would reveal that in the modern-day, the character now works at The Pentagon. The script was ultimately rejected and scrapped.[149][150][151][152] After experiencing financial difficulties in the 2000s, DreamWorks Pictures was sold to Paramount Pictures in 2006 and any development on the sequel was halted.[153]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Scott stated that his concerns with prior difficulties of developing a script where Maximus is reintroduced after being deceased had been resolved. The filmmaker expressed enthusiasm for the future of the project, while discussions with Russell Crowe to reprise his role were ongoing.[154] In November 2018, it was announced that Paramount was officially green-lighting the development of a sequel, with Scott in early-negotiations to once again serve as director. The project would be a joint-venture production between Paramount, Scott Free Productions, and Parkes/MacDonald Productions with Universal as a co-financing partner.[155]\n\n\nIn June 2019, producers stated that they \"wouldn't touch [*Gladiator*] unless we felt in a way to do it was legitimate\". The script was revealed to take place 25\u201330 years after the first film.[156] The plot is intended to center around Lucius.[157] In April 2021, Chris Hemsworth approached Crowe with a proposal to become involved with the project. As a fan of the first installment, Hemsworth proposed serving as co-producer in order to see the film realized. While working together on *Thor: Love and Thunder*, the two actors shared additional ideas for where the story for a *Gladiator 2* could go.[158] By September 2021, Scott stated that the script was once again being worked on with his intention being to direct the sequel upon the completion of production on his current project, *Napoleon*.[159]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Paul Mescal was in final talks to star in the upcoming sequel, as Lucius.[160][161][162] Working from a script written by David Scarpa,[7] Scott will produce the film alongside Michael Pruss, Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher. Janty Yates and Arthur Max, the costume designer and production designer, respectively, of the original film are also set to return for the sequel.[162][163] Later that month, Crowe stated that the story will center around Lucius becoming emperor, while stating that he will not be involved in the project.[164] In March 2023, Denzel Washington and Barry Keoghan joined the cast.[165] Joseph Quinn also joined in April while Connie Nielsen was announced to be returning as Lucius' mother. On May 19, 2023, Keoghan has dropped out of the sequel as a result of scheduling conflicts, with Fred Hechinger in talks to replace him. The film is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 22, 2024.[166] [167]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Ancient Rome portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* List of films set in ancient Rome\n* Lists of historical films\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gladiator\u00a0\u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards\". *The New York Times*. 2015.
