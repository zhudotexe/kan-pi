They are used for generating random values, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance.\n\n\nA traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. Dice may also have polyhedral or irregular shapes, may have faces marked with numerals or symbols instead of pips and may have their numbers carved out from the material of the dice instead of marked on it. Loaded dice are designed to favor some results over others for cheating or entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Composite image of all sides of a 12 mm (1⁄2 in) Roman die, found in Leicestershire, England\nDice have been used since before recorded history, and it is uncertain where they originated. It is theorized that dice developed from the practice of fortune-telling with the talus of hoofed animals, colloquially known as knucklebones.[2] The Egyptian game of senet (played before 3000 BCE and up to the 2nd century CE) was played with flat two-sided throwsticks which indicated the number of squares a player could move, and thus functioned as a form of dice.[3] Perhaps the oldest known dice were excavated as part of a backgammon-like game set at the Burnt City, an archeological site in south-eastern Iran, estimated to be from between 2800 and 2500 BCE.[4][5] Bone dice from Skara Brae, Scotland have been dated to 3100–2400 BCE.[6] Excavations from graves at Mohenjo-daro, an Indus Valley civilization settlement, unearthed terracotta dice dating to 2500–1900 BCE,[7] including at least one die whose opposite sides all add up to seven, as in modern dice.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Knucklebones die, made of soapstone\nGames involving dice are mentioned in the ancient Indian *Rigveda*, *Atharvaveda,* *Mahabharata* and Buddhist games list.[9] There are several biblical references to \"casting lots\" (Hebrew: יפילו גורל *yappîlū ḡōrāl*), as in Psalm 22, indicating that dicing (or a related activity) was commonplace when the psalm was composed. Knucklebones was a game of skill played in ancient Greece; a derivative form had the four sides of bones receive different values like modern dice.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Roman wall painting showing two dice-players, Pompeii, 1st century\n![](image)Twenty-sided serpentinite die from Ptolemaic Egypt[11]\nAlthough gambling was illegal, many Romans were passionate gamblers who enjoyed dicing, which was known as *aleam ludere* (\"to play at dice\"). There were two sizes of Roman dice. *Tali* were large dice inscribed with one, three, four, and six on four sides. *Tesserae* were smaller dice with sides numbered from one to six.[12] Twenty-sided dice date back to the 2nd century CE[13] and from Ptolemaic Egypt as early as the 2nd century BCE.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)A collection of historical dice from various regions of Asia\nDominoes and playing cards originated in China as developments from dice.[14] The transition from dice to playing cards occurred in China around the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), and coincides with the technological transition from rolls of manuscripts to block printed books.[15] In Japan, dice were used to play a popular game called sugoroku. There are two types of sugoroku. *Ban-sugoroku* is similar to backgammon and dates to the Heian period (794–1185 CE), while *e-sugoroku* is a racing game.[16]\n\n\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n\nDice are thrown onto a surface either from the hand or from a container designed for this (such as a cup or tray). The face (or corner, in cases such as tetrahedral dice, or edge, for odd-numbered long dice) of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. \n\n\nThe result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of classical mechanics. A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. \n\n\nOne typical contemporary dice game is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into board games, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in backgammon and *Monopoly*).\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n### Arrangement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chirality of dice. Faces may be placed counterclockwise (top) *or* clockwise.\nCommon dice are small cubes, most often 1.6 cm (0.63 in) across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of Arabic numerals is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)\n\n\nOpposite sides of a modern die traditionally add up to seven, requiring the 1, 2, and 3 faces to share a vertex.[17] The faces of a die may be placed clockwise or counterclockwise about this vertex. If the 1, 2, and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called \"right-handed\". If those faces run clockwise, the die is called \"left-handed\". Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Typical facets showing the more compact pip arrangement of an Asian-style die (top) vs. a Western-style die (bottom)\nThe pips on standard six-sided dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown. Asian style dice bear similar patterns to Western ones, but the pips are closer to the center of the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are colored red on the 1 and 4 sides. Red fours may be of Indian origin.[18][19]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Western, Asian, and casino dice\nNon-precision dice are manufactured via the plastic injection molding process, often made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The pips or numbers on the die are a part of the mold. Different pigments can be added to the dice to make them opaque or transparent, or multiple pigments may be added to make the dice speckled or marbled.[20]\n\n\nThe coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the die entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry. The die is then polished via a tumble finishing process similar to rock polishing. The abrasive agent scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also produces the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.\n\n\nPrecision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same density as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. This mitigates concerns that the pips will cause a small bias.[21] All such dice are stamped with a serial number to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die. Precision backgammon dice are made the same way; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the dice cup and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.\n\n\n\n### Etymology and terms[edit]\n\n\nThe word die comes from Old French *dé*; from Latin *datum* \"something which is given or played\".[22]\n\n\nWhile the terms *ace*, *deuce*, *trey*, *cater*, *cinque* and *sice* are generally obsolete, with the names of the numbers preferred, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice. *Ace* is from the Latin *as*, meaning \"a unit\";[23] the others are 2 to 6 in Old French.[24]\n\n\nWhen rolling two dice, certain combinations have slang names. The term *snake eyes* is a roll of one pip on each die. The *Online Etymology Dictionary* traces use of the term as far back as 1919.[25]\nThe US term *boxcars*, also known as *midnight*, is a roll of six pips on each die. The pair of six pips resembles a pair of boxcars on a freight train. Many rolls have names in the game of craps.\n\n\n\n### Unicode representation[edit]\n\n\n⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅\n\n\nUsing Unicode characters, the faces can be shown in text using the range U+2680 to U+2685 or using decimal `&#9856;` to `&#9861;`.[26]\n\n\n\n## Loaded dice[edit]\n\n\nA loaded, weighted, cheat, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for making loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces, and weights. Casinos and gambling halls frequently use transparent cellulose acetate dice as tampering is easier to detect than with opaque dice.[27]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### Polyhedral dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A typical set of polyhedral dice in various colors. They consist of the five Platonic solids, along with a ten-sided die that is also used for generating percentages.\nVarious shapes like two-sided or four-sided dice are documented in archaeological findings; for example, from Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. \n\n\nThe modern tradition of using *sets* of polyhedral dice started around the end of the 1960s when non-cubical dice became popular among players of wargames,[28] and since have been employed extensively in role-playing games and trading card games. Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.\n\n\n\n#### Common variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Isohedron\n\nDice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the Platonic solids, whose faces are regular polygons. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal trapezohedron die, whose faces are ten kites, each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a uniform distribution of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to normal distributions.[29]\n\n\nUnlike other common dice, a four-sided (tetrahedral) die does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it must be read in a different way. On some four-sided dice, each face features multiple numbers, with the same number printed near each vertex on all sides. In this case, the number around the vertex pointing up is used. Alternatively, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middles of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are used.\n\n\nNormally, the faces on a die will be placed so opposite faces will add up to one more than the number of faces. (This is not possible with 4-sided dice and dice with an odd number of faces.) Some dice, such as those with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.\n\n\nSome twenty-sided dice have a different arrangement used for the purpose of keeping track of an integer that counts down, such as health points. These *spindown dice* are arranged such that adjacent integers appear on adjacent faces, allowing the user to easily find the next lower number. They are commonly used with collectible card games.[30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Faces/Sides\n | Shape\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Tetrahedron | ![Tetrahedron](image) | Each face has three numbers, arranged such that the upright number, placed either near the vertex or near the opposite edge, is the same on all three visible faces. The upright numbers represent the value of the roll. This die does not roll well and thus it is usually thrown into the air instead.\n |\n| 6 | Cube | ![Cube](image) | A common die. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 7.\n |\n| 8 | Octahedron | ![Octahedron](image) | Each face is triangular and the die resembles two square pyramids attached base-to-base. Usually, the sum of the opposite faces is 9.\n |\n| 10 | Pentagonal trapezohedron | ![Pentagonal trapezohedron](image) | Each face is a kite. The die has two sharp corners, where five kites meet, and ten blunter corners, where three kites meet. The ten faces usually bear numbers from zero to nine, rather than one to ten (zero being read as \"ten\" in many applications). Often all odd numbered faces converge at one sharp corner, and the even ones at the other. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is usually 9 (if numbered 0–9) or 11 (if numbered 1–10).\n |\n| 12 | Dodecahedron | ![Dodecahedron](image) | Each face is a regular pentagon. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is usually 13.\n |\n| 20 | Icosahedron | ![Icosahedron](image) | Faces are equilateral triangles. Icosahedra have been found dating to Roman/Ptolemaic times, but it is not known if they were used as gaming dice. Modern dice with 20 sides are sometimes numbered 0–9 twice as an alternative to 10-sided dice. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 21 if numbered 1–20.\n |\n\n\n#### Rarer variations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dice collection: D2–D22, D24, D26, D28, D30, D36, D48, D50, D60 and D100.\n\"Uniform fair dice\" are dice where all faces have equal probability of outcome due to the symmetry of the die as it is face-transitive. In addition to the Platonic solids, these theoretically include:\n\n\n\n* Catalan solids, the duals of the 13 Archimedean solids: 12, 24, 30, 48, 60, 120 sides\n* Trapezohedra, the duals of the infinite set of antiprisms, with kite faces: any even number not divisible by 4 (so that a face will face up), starting from 6\n* Bipyramids, the duals of the infinite set of prisms, with triangle faces: any multiple of 4 (so that a face will face up), starting from 8\n* Disphenoids, an infinite set of tetrahedra made from congruent non-regular triangles: 4 sides. This is a less symmetric tetrahedron than the Platonic tetrahedron, but still sufficiently symmetrical to be face-transitive. Similarly, pyritohedra and tetartoids are less symmetrical but still face-transitive dodecahedra: 12 sides.\n\n\nTwo other types of polyhedra are technically not face-transitive, but are still fair dice due to symmetry:\n\n\n\n* antiprisms: the basis of barrel dice\n* prisms: the basis of long dice and teetotums\n\n\nLong dice and teetotums can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers.[31] Long dice are based on the infinite set of prisms. All the rectangular faces are mutually face-transitive, so they are equally probable. The two ends of the prism may be rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die cannot rest on those faces. 4-sided long dice are easier to roll than tetrahedra, and are used in the traditional board games dayakattai and daldøs.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Faces/sides\n | Shape\n | Image\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Möbius strip or sphere | ![](image) | Most commonly a joke die, this is either a sphere with a 1 marked on it or shaped like a Möbius strip.\n |\n| 2\n | Flat Cylinder or Flat Prism | ![](image) | A coin flip. Some coins with 1 marked on one side and 2 on the other are available, but most simply use a common coin.\n |\n| 3\n | Rounded-off triangular prism | ![](image) | A long die intended to be rolled lengthwise. When the die is rolled, one edge (rather than a side) appears facing upwards. On either side of each edge the same number is printed (from 1 to 3).

However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for Boggle, directions for *Warhammer Fantasy Battle*, Fudge dice, playing card symbols for poker dice, and instructions for sexual acts using sex dice.\n\n\n\n### Alternatively-numbered dice[edit]\n\n\nDice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.[34][35] These are six-sided dice with sides numbered `2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5`, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required.[35] Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and intransitive dice.\n\n\n\n### Spherical dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A spherical die\nA die can be constructed in the shape of a sphere, with the addition of an internal cavity in the shape of the dual polyhedron of the desired die shape and an internal weight. The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Playing Dice* by Master Jean de Mauléon (c. 1520)\nMany board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as *Axis & Allies*, have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age,[*when?*] a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In *Castles of Burgundy*, players spend their dice to take actions based on the die's value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In *Quarriors* (and its descendant, *Dicemasters*), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.[36]\n\n\nDice can be used for divination and using dice for such a purpose is called cleromancy. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this method of divination. It is highly likely that the Pythagoreans used the Platonic solids as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Typical role-playing dice, showing a variety of colors and styles. Note the older hand-inked green 12-sided die (showing an 11), manufactured before pre-inked dice were common. Many players collect or acquire a large number of mixed and unmatching dice.\nPolyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game *Dungeons & Dragons* (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like *Exalted* which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, dice notation is frequently used.\n\n\nAstrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents the planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the nodes of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. A specialized icosahedron die provides the answers of the Magic 8 Ball, conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\n\nDice can be used to generate random numbers for use in passwords and cryptography applications. The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes a method by which dice can be used to generate passphrases.[38] Diceware is a method recommended for generating secure but memorable passphrases, by repeatedly rolling five dice and picking the corresponding word from a pre-generated list.[39]\n\n\n\n### Notation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dice notation\n\nIn many gaming contexts, especially tabletop role-playing games, shorthand notations representing different dice rolls are used. A \"d\" or \"D\" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example,`d4`denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence,`6d8` means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, `3d6+4` instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Astragalomancy\n* Crown and Anchor\n* d20 System\n* Dreidel\n* Fuzzy dice\n* *Musikalisches Würfelspiel*\n* Die throw (review)\n* Intransitive dice\n* Quincunx\n* Teetotum\n* Urim and Thummim\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"die, n.1\". *OED Online*.

Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex.

It has been suggested that certain carved stone balls created by the late Neolithic people of Scotland represent these shapes; however, these balls have rounded knobs rather than being polyhedral, the numbers of knobs frequently differed from the numbers of vertices of the Platonic solids, there is no ball whose knobs match the 20 vertices of the dodecahedron, and the arrangement of the knobs was not always symmetric.[3]\n\n\nThe ancient Greeks studied the Platonic solids extensively. Some sources (such as Proclus) credit Pythagoras with their discovery. Other evidence suggests that he may have only been familiar with the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron and that the discovery of the octahedron and icosahedron belong to Theaetetus, a contemporary of Plato. In any case, Theaetetus gave a mathematical description of all five and may have been responsible for the first known proof that no other convex regular polyhedra exist.\n\n\nThe Platonic solids are prominent in the philosophy of Plato, their namesake. Plato wrote about them in the dialogue *Timaeus* c. 360 B.C. in which he associated each of the four classical elements (earth, air, water, and fire) with a regular solid. Earth was associated with the cube, air with the octahedron, water with the icosahedron, and fire with the tetrahedron.\n\n\nOf the fifth Platonic solid, the dodecahedron, Plato obscurely remarked, \"...the god used [it] for arranging the constellations on the whole heaven\". Aristotle added a fifth element, aither (aether in Latin, \"ether\" in English) and postulated that the heavens were made of this element, but he had no interest in matching it with Plato's fifth solid.[4]\n\n\nEuclid completely mathematically described the Platonic solids in the *Elements*, the last book (Book XIII) of which is devoted to their properties. Propositions 13–17 in Book XIII describe the construction of the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron in that order. For each solid Euclid finds the ratio of the diameter of the circumscribed sphere to the edge length. In Proposition 18 he argues that there are no further convex regular polyhedra. Andreas Speiser has advocated the view that the construction of the five regular solids is the chief goal of the deductive system canonized in the *Elements*.[5] Much of the information in Book XIII is probably derived from the work of Theaetetus.\n\n\nIn the 16th century, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler attempted to relate the five extraterrestrial planets known at that time to the five Platonic solids. In *Mysterium Cosmographicum*, published in 1596, Kepler proposed a model of the Solar System in which the five solids were set inside one another and separated by a series of inscribed and circumscribed spheres. Kepler proposed that the distance relationships between the six planets known at that time could be understood in terms of the five Platonic solids enclosed within a sphere that represented the orbit of Saturn. The six spheres each corresponded to one of the planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). The solids were ordered with the innermost being the octahedron, followed by the icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and finally the cube, thereby dictating the structure of the solar system and the distance relationships between the planets by the Platonic solids. In the end, Kepler's original idea had to be abandoned, but out of his research came his three laws of orbital dynamics, the first of which was that the orbits of planets are ellipses rather than circles, changing the course of physics and astronomy. He also discovered the Kepler solids, which are two *nonconvex* regular polyhedra.\n\n\n\n## Cartesian coordinates[edit]\n\n\nFor Platonic solids centered at the origin, simple Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are given below. The Greek letter *φ* is used to represent the golden ratio 1 + √5/2 ≈ 1.6180.\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n| Figure\n | Tetrahedron | Octahedron | Cube | Icosahedron | Dodecahedron\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Faces\n | 4 | 8 | 6 | 20 | 12\n |\n| Vertices\n | 4 | 6 (2 × 3) | 8 | 12 (4 × 3) | 20 (8 + 4 × 3)\n |\n| Position | 1 | 2 |  |  | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2\n |\n| Vertex coordinates\n | (1, 1, 1)(1, −1, −1)(−1, 1, −1)(−1, −1,  1) | (−1, −1, −1)(−1, 1, 1)( 1, −1,  1)( 1,  1, −1) | (±1,  0,  0)( 0, ±1,  0)( 0,  0, ±1) | (±1, ±1, ±1) | ( 0, ±1, ±*φ*)(±1, ±*φ*,  0)(±*φ*,  0, ±1) | ( 0, ±*φ*, ±1)(±*φ*, ±1,  0)(±1,  0, ±*φ*) | (±1, ±1, ±1)( 0, ±1/*φ*, ±*φ*)(±1/*φ*, ±*φ*,  0)(±*φ*,  0, ±1/*φ*) | (±1, ±1, ±1)( 0, ±*φ*, ±1/*φ*)(±*φ*, ±1/*φ*,  0)(±1/*φ*,  0, ±*φ*)\n |\n\n\nThe coordinates for the tetrahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron are given in two positions such that each can be deduced from the other: in the case of the tetrahedron, by changing all coordinates of sign (central symmetry), or, in the other cases, by exchanging two coordinates (reflection with respect to any of the three diagonal planes).\n\n\nThese coordinates reveal certain relationships between the Platonic solids: the vertices of the tetrahedron represent half of those of the cube, as {4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), one of two sets of 4 vertices in dual positions, as h{4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image). Both tetrahedral positions make the compound stellated octahedron.\n\n\nThe coordinates of the icosahedron are related to two alternated sets of coordinates of a nonuniform truncated octahedron, t{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), also called a *snub octahedron*, as s{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), and seen in the compound of two icosahedra.\n\n\nEight of the vertices of the dodecahedron are shared with the cube. Completing all orientations leads to the compound of five cubes.\n\n\n\n## Combinatorial properties[edit]\n\n\nA convex polyhedron is a Platonic solid if and only if all three of the following requirements are met.\n\n\n\n* All of its faces are congruent convex regular polygons.\n* None of its faces intersect except at their edges.\n* The same number of faces meet at each of its vertices.\n\n\nEach Platonic solid can therefore be assigned a pair {*p*, *q*} of integers, where *p* is the number of edges (or, equivalently, vertices) of each face, and *q* is the number of faces (or, equivalently, edges) that meet at each vertex. This pair {*p*, *q*}, called the Schläfli symbol, gives a combinatorial description of the polyhedron. The Schläfli symbols of the five Platonic solids are given in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of Platonic solids\n| Polyhedron\n | Vertices | Edges | Faces | Schläfli symbol | Vertex configuration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| tetrahedron | ![Tetrahedron](image) | 4 | 6 | 4 | {3, 3} | 3.3.3\n |\n| cube | ![Hexahedron (cube)](image) | 8 | 12 | 6 | {4, 3} | 4.4.4\n |\n| octahedron | ![Octahedron](image) | 6 | 12 | 8 | {3, 4} | 3.3.3.3\n |\n| dodecahedron | ![Dodecahedron](image) | 20 | 30 | 12 | {5, 3} | 5.5.5\n |\n| icosahedron | ![Icosahedron](image) | 12 | 30 | 20 | {3, 5} | 3.3.3.3.3\n |\n\n\nAll other combinatorial information about these solids, such as total number of vertices (*V*), edges (*E*), and faces (*F*), can be determined from *p* and *q*. Since any edge joins two vertices and has two adjacent faces we must have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\nF\n=\n2\nE\n=\nq\nV\n.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle pF=2E=qV.\\,}\n\n![{\\displaystyle pF=2E=qV.\\,}](image)\nThe other relationship between these values is given by Euler's formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n−\nE\n+\nF\n=\n2.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V-E+F=2.\\,}\n\n![{\\displaystyle V-E+F=2.\\,}](image)\nThis can be proved in many ways. Together these three relationships completely determine *V*, *E*, and *F*:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n=\n\n\n\n4\np\n\n\n4\n−\n(\np\n−\n2\n)\n(\nq\n−\n2\n)\n\n\n\n,\n\nE\n=\n\n\n\n2\np\nq\n\n\n4\n−\n(\np\n−\n2\n)\n(\nq\n−\n2\n)\n\n\n\n,\n\nF\n=\n\n\n\n4\nq\n\n\n4\n−\n(\np\n−\n2\n)\n(\nq\n−\n2\n)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V={\\frac {4p}{4-(p-2)(q-2)}},\\quad E={\\frac {2pq}{4-(p-2)(q-2)}},\\quad F={\\frac {4q}{4-(p-2)(q-2)}}.}\n\n![{\\displaystyle V={\\frac {4p}{4-(p-2)(q-2)}},\\quad E={\\frac {2pq}{4-(p-2)(q-2)}},\\quad F={\\frac {4q}{4-(p-2)(q-2)}}.}](image)\nSwapping *p* and *q* interchanges *F* and *V* while leaving *E* unchanged. For a geometric interpretation of this property, see § Dual polyhedra.\n\n\n\n### As a configuration[edit]\n\n\nThe elements of a polyhedron can be expressed in a configuration matrix. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, and faces. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole polyhedron. The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column's element occur in or at the row's element. Dual pairs of polyhedra have their configuration matrices rotated 180 degrees from each other.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n| {p,q}\n | Platonic configurations\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Group order: *g* = 8*pq*/(4 − (*p* − 2)(*q* − 2))\n | *g* = 24\n | *g* = 48\n | *g* = 120\n |\n| \n\n|  | v | e | f\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| v\n | *g*/2*q* | *q* | *q* |\n| e\n | 2 | *g*/4 | 2\n |\n| f\n | *p* | *p* | *g*/2*p* |\n\n | \n\n{3,3}\n| 4 | 3 | 3\n |\n| 2 | 6 | 2\n |\n| 3 | 3 | 4\n |\n\n | \n\n{3,4}\n| 6 | 4 | 4\n |\n| 2 | 12 | 2\n |\n| 3 | 3 | 8\n |\n\n | \n\n{4,3}\n| 8 | 3 | 3\n |\n| 2 | 12 | 2\n |\n| 4 | 4 | 6\n |\n\n | \n\n{3,5}\n| 12 | 5 | 5\n |\n| 2 | 30 | 2\n |\n| 3 | 3 | 20\n |\n\n | \n\n{5,3}\n| 20 | 3 | 3\n |\n| 2 | 30 | 2\n |\n| 5 | 5 | 12\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\nThe classical result is that only five convex regular polyhedra exist. Two common arguments below demonstrate no more than five Platonic solids can exist, but positively demonstrating the existence of any given solid is a separate question—one that requires an explicit construction.\n\n\n\n### Geometric proof[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPolygon nets around a vertex\n| ![](image){3,3}Defect 180°\n | ![](image){3,4}Defect 120°\n | ![](image){3,5}Defect 60°\n | ![](image){3,6}Defect 0°\n |\n| ![](image){4,3}Defect 90°\n | ![](image){4,4}Defect 0°\n | ![](image){5,3}Defect 36°\n | ![](image){6,3}Defect 0°\n |\n| A vertex needs at least 3 faces, and an angle defect. A 0° angle defect will fill the Euclidean plane with a regular tiling. By Descartes' theorem, the number of vertices is 720°/*defect*.\n |\n\n\nThe following geometric argument is very similar to the one given by Euclid in the *Elements*:\n\n\n\n1. Each vertex of the solid must be a vertex for at least three faces.\n2. At each vertex of the solid, the total, among the adjacent faces, of the angles between their respective adjacent sides must be strictly less than 360°. The amount less than 360° is called an angle defect.\n3. Regular polygons of six or more sides have only angles of 120° or more, so the common face must be the triangle, square, or pentagon. For these different shapes of faces the following holds:\nTriangular faces\nEach vertex of a regular triangle is 60°, so a shape may have three, four, or five triangles meeting at a vertex; these are the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\nSquare faces\nEach vertex of a square is 90°, so there is only one arrangement possible with three faces at a vertex, the cube.\nPentagonal faces\nEach vertex is 108°; again, only one arrangement of three faces at a vertex is possible, the dodecahedron.\nAltogether this makes five possible Platonic solids.\n\n### Topological proof[edit]\n\n\nA purely topological proof can be made using only combinatorial information about the solids. The key is Euler's observation that *V* − *E* + *F* = 2, and the fact that *pF* = 2*E* = *qV*, where *p* stands for the number of edges of each face and *q* for the number of edges meeting at each vertex. Combining these equations one obtains the equation\n\n\n\n![](image)Orthographic projections and Schlegel diagrams with Hamiltonian cycles of the vertices of the five platonic solids – only the octahedron has an Eulerian path or cycle, by extending its path with the dotted one * v\n* t\n* e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nE\n\nq\n\n\n−\nE\n+\n\n\n\n2\nE\n\np\n\n\n=\n2.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2E}{q}}-E+{\\frac {2E}{p}}=2.}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2E}{q}}-E+{\\frac {2E}{p}}=2.}](image)\nSimple algebraic manipulation then gives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nq\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\nE\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {1 \\over q}+{1 \\over p}={1 \\over 2}+{1 \\over E}.}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {1 \\over q}+{1 \\over p}={1 \\over 2}+{1 \\over E}.}](image)\nSince *E* is strictly positive we must have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nq\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\np\n\n\n>\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{q}}+{\\frac {1}{p}}>{\\frac {1}{2}}.}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{q}}+{\\frac {1}{p}}>{\\frac {1}{2}}.}](image)\nUsing the fact that *p* and *q* must both be at least 3, one can easily see that there are only five possibilities for {*p*, *q*}:\n\n\n\n{3, 3}, {4, 3}, {3, 4}, {5, 3}, {3, 5}.\n## Geometric properties[edit]\n\n\n### Angles[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of angles associated with each Platonic solid. The dihedral angle is the interior angle between any two face planes.

The defect, *δ*, at any vertex of the Platonic solids {*p*,*q*} is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nδ\n=\n2\nπ\n−\nq\nπ\n\n(\n\n1\n−\n\n\n2\np\n\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\delta =2\\pi -q\\pi \\left(1-{2 \\over p}\\right).}\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\delta =2\\pi -q\\pi \\left(1-{2 \\over p}\\right).}](image)\nBy a theorem of Descartes, this is equal to 4π divided by the number of vertices (i.e. the total defect at all vertices is 4π).\n\n\nThe three-dimensional analog of a plane angle is a solid angle.

This is equal to the angular deficiency of its dual.\n\n\nThe various angles associated with the Platonic solids are tabulated below. The numerical values of the solid angles are given in steradians.

property[edit]\n\n\nA polyhedron *P* is said to have the *Rupert* property if a polyhedron of the same or larger size and the same shape as *P* can pass through a hole in *P*.[8]\nAll five Platonic solids have this property.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n## Symmetry[edit]\n\n\n### Dual polyhedra[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDual compounds\n\nEvery polyhedron has a dual (or \"polar\") polyhedron **with faces and vertices interchanged**. The dual of every Platonic solid is another Platonic solid, so that we can arrange the five solids into dual pairs.\n\n\n\n* The tetrahedron is self-dual (i.e. its dual is another tetrahedron).\n* The cube and the octahedron form a dual pair.\n* The dodecahedron and the icosahedron form a dual pair.\n\n\nIf a polyhedron has Schläfli symbol {*p*, *q*}, then its dual has the symbol {*q*, *p*}. Indeed, every combinatorial property of one Platonic solid can be interpreted as another combinatorial property of the dual.\n\n\nOne can construct the dual polyhedron by taking the vertices of the dual to be the centers of the faces of the original figure. Connecting the centers of adjacent faces in the original forms the edges of the dual and thereby interchanges the number of faces and vertices while maintaining the number of edges.\n\n\nMore generally, one can dualize a Platonic solid with respect to a sphere of radius *d* concentric with the solid. The radii (*R*, *ρ*, *r*) of a solid and those of its dual (*R*\\*, *ρ*\\*, *r*\\*) are related by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\nR\n\n∗\n\n\nr\n=\n\nr\n\n∗\n\n\nR\n=\n\nρ\n\n∗\n\n\nρ\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d^{2}=R^{\\ast }r=r^{\\ast }R=\\rho ^{\\ast }\\rho .}\n\n![{\\displaystyle d^{2}=R^{\\ast }r=r^{\\ast }R=\\rho ^{\\ast }\\rho .}](image)\nDualizing with respect to the midsphere (*d* = *ρ*) is often convenient because the midsphere has the same relationship to both polyhedra. Taking *d*2 = *Rr* yields a dual solid with the same circumradius and inradius (i.e. *R*\\* = *R* and *r*\\* = *r*).\n\n\n\n### Symmetry groups[edit]\n\n\nIn mathematics, the concept of symmetry is studied with the notion of a mathematical group. Every polyhedron has an associated symmetry group, which is the set of all transformations (Euclidean isometries) which leave the polyhedron invariant. The order of the symmetry group is the number of symmetries of the polyhedron. One often distinguishes between the *full symmetry group*, which includes reflections, and the *proper symmetry group*, which includes only rotations.\n\n\nThe symmetry groups of the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is *regular* if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.\n\n\nThere are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:\n\n\n\n* the tetrahedral group *T*,\n* the octahedral group *O* (which is also the symmetry group of the cube), and\n* the icosahedral group *I* (which is also the symmetry group of the dodecahedron).\n\n\nThe orders of the proper (rotation) groups are 12, 24, and 60 respectively – precisely twice the number of edges in the respective polyhedra. The orders of the full symmetry groups are twice as much again (24, 48, and 120). See (Coxeter 1973) for a derivation of these facts. All Platonic solids except the tetrahedron are *centrally symmetric,* meaning they are preserved under reflection through the origin.\n\n\nThe following table lists the various symmetry properties of the Platonic solids. The symmetry groups listed are the full groups with the rotation subgroups given in parentheses (likewise for the number of symmetries). Wythoff's kaleidoscope construction is a method for constructing polyhedra directly from their symmetry groups. They are listed for reference Wythoff's symbol for each of the Platonic solids.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Polyhedron\n | Schläflisymbol | Wythoffsymbol | Dualpolyhedron | Symmetry group (reflection, rotation)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Polyhedral | Schön. | Cox. | Orb. | Order |\n| tetrahedron | {3, 3} | 3 | 2 3 | tetrahedron\n | Tetrahedral ![](image) | *T*d*T* | [3,3][3,3]+ | \\*332332\n | 2412\n |\n| cube | {4, 3} | 3 | 2 4 | octahedron\n | Octahedral ![](image) | *O*h*O* | [4,3][4,3]+ | \\*432432\n | 4824\n |\n| octahedron | {3, 4} | 4 | 2 3 | cube\n |\n| dodecahedron | {5, 3} | 3 | 2 5 | icosahedron\n | Icosahedral ![](image) | *I*h*I* | [5,3][5,3]+ | \\*532532\n | 12060\n |\n| icosahedron | {3, 5} | 5 | 2 3 | dodecahedron\n |\n\n\n## In nature and technology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

These by no means exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals. However, neither the regular icosahedron nor the regular dodecahedron are amongst them. One of the forms, called the pyritohedron (named for the group of minerals of which it is typical) has twelve pentagonal faces, arranged in the same pattern as the faces of the regular dodecahedron. The faces of the pyritohedron are, however, not regular, so the pyritohedron is also not regular. Allotropes of boron and many boron compounds, such as boron carbide, include discrete B12 icosahedra within their crystal structures. Carborane acids also have molecular structures approximating regular icosahedra.\n\n\n\n![](image)Circogonia icosahedra, a species of radiolaria, shaped like a regular icosahedron.\nIn the early 20th century, Ernst Haeckel described (Haeckel, 1904) a number of species of Radiolaria, some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include *Circoporus octahedrus*, *Circogonia icosahedra*, *Lithocubus geometricus* and *Circorrhegma dodecahedra*. The shapes of these creatures should be obvious from their names.\n\n\nMany viruses, such as the herpes[11] virus, have the shape of a regular icosahedron. Viral structures are built of repeated identical protein subunits and the icosahedron is the easiest shape to assemble using these subunits. A regular polyhedron is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein used over and over again; this saves space in the viral genome.\n\n\nIn meteorology and climatology, global numerical models of atmospheric flow are of increasing interest which employ geodesic grids that are based on an icosahedron (refined by triangulation) instead of the more commonly used longitude/latitude grid. This has the advantage of evenly distributed spatial resolution without singularities (i.e. the poles) at the expense of somewhat greater numerical difficulty.\n\n\n\n![Icosahedron as a part of Spinoza monument in Amsterdam](image)Icosahedron as a part of Spinoza monument in Amsterdam\nGeometry of space frames is often based on platonic solids. In the MERO system, Platonic solids are used for naming convention of various space frame configurations. For example, 1/2O+T refers to a configuration made of one half of octahedron and a tetrahedron.\n\n\nSeveral Platonic hydrocarbons have been synthesised, including cubane and dodecahedrane and not tetrahedrane.\n\n\n\n* ![Tetrahedrane](image)\n\nTetrahedrane\n* ![Cubane](image)\n\nCubane\n* ![Dodecahedrane](image)\n\nDodecahedrane\n\n\n![](image)A set of polyhedral dice.\nPlatonic solids are often used to make dice, because dice of these shapes can be made fair. 6-sided dice are very common, but the other numbers are commonly used in role-playing games. Such dice are commonly referred to as d*n* where *n* is the number of faces (d8, d20, etc.); see dice notation for more details.\n\n\nThese shapes frequently show up in other games or puzzles. Puzzles similar to a Rubik's Cube come in all five shapes – see magic polyhedra.\n\n\n\n### Liquid crystals with symmetries of Platonic solids[edit]\n\n\nFor the intermediate material phase called liquid crystals, the existence of such symmetries was first proposed in 1981 by H. Kleinert and K. Maki.[12][13]\nIn aluminum the icosahedral structure was discovered three years after this by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.\n\n\n\n## Related polyhedra and polytopes[edit]\n\n\n### Uniform polyhedra[edit]\n\n\nThere exist four regular polyhedra that are not convex, called Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. These all have icosahedral symmetry and may be obtained as stellations of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)cuboctahedron | ![](image)icosidodecahedron |\n\n\nThe next most regular convex polyhedra after the Platonic solids are the cuboctahedron, which is a rectification of the cube and the octahedron, and the icosidodecahedron, which is a rectification of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (the rectification of the self-dual tetrahedron is a regular octahedron). These are both *quasi-regular*, meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry. Their duals, the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron, are edge- and face-transitive, but their faces are not regular and their vertices come in two types each; they are two of the thirteen Catalan solids.\n\n\nThe uniform polyhedra form a much broader class of polyhedra. These figures are vertex-uniform and have one or more types of regular or star polygons for faces. These include all the polyhedra mentioned above together with an infinite set of prisms, an infinite set of antiprisms, and 53 other non-convex forms.\n\n\nThe Johnson solids are convex polyhedra which have regular faces but are not uniform. Among them are five of the eight convex deltahedra, which have identical, regular faces (all equilateral triangles) but are not uniform. (The other three convex deltahedra are the Platonic tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron.)\n\n\n\n### Regular tessellations[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRegular spherical tilings\n| Platonic\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| {3,3}\n | {4,3}\n | {3,4}\n | {5,3}\n | {3,5}\n |\n| Regular dihedral\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| {2,2}\n | {3,2}\n | {4,2}\n | {5,2}\n | {6,2}...\n |\n| Regular hosohedral\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| {2,2}\n | {2,3}\n | {2,4}\n | {2,5}\n | {2,6}...\n |\n\n\nThe three regular tessellations of the plane are closely related to the Platonic solids. Indeed, one can view the Platonic solids as regular tessellations of the sphere. This is done by projecting each solid onto a concentric sphere. The faces project onto regular spherical polygons which exactly cover the sphere. Spherical tilings provide two infinite additional sets of regular tilings, the hosohedra, {2,*n*} with 2 vertices at the poles, and lune faces, and the dual dihedra, {*n*,2} with 2 hemispherical faces and regularly spaced vertices on the equator. Such tesselations would be degenerate in true 3D space as polyhedra.\n\n\nOne can show that every regular tessellation of the sphere is characterized by a pair of integers {*p*, *q*} with 1/*p* + 1/*q* > 1/2. Likewise, a regular tessellation of the plane is characterized by the condition 1/*p* + 1/*q* = 1/2.

There are exactly six of these figures; five are analogous to the Platonic solids : 5-cell as {3,3,3}, 16-cell as {3,3,4}, 600-cell as {3,3,5}, tesseract as {4,3,3}, and 120-cell as {5,3,3}, and a sixth one, the self-dual 24-cell, {3,4,3}.\n\n\nIn all dimensions higher than four, there are only three convex regular polytopes: the simplex as {3,3,...,3}, the hypercube as {4,3,...,3}, and the cross-polytope as {3,3,...,4}.[14] In three dimensions, these coincide with the tetrahedron as {3,3}, the cube as {4,3}, and the octahedron as {3,4}.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Archimedean solid\n* Catalan solid\n* Deltahedron\n* Johnson solid\n* Goldberg solid\n* Kepler solids\n* List of regular polytopes\n* Prince Rupert's cube\n* Regular polytopes\n* Regular skew polyhedron\n* Toroidal polyhedron\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Gardner (1987): Martin Gardner wrote a popular account of the five solids in his December 1958 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.\n2. **^** Zeyl, Donald (2019). \"Plato's Timaeus\". *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*.\n3. **^** Lloyd 2012.\n4. **^** Wildberg (1988): Wildberg discusses the correspondence of the Platonic solids with elements in *Timaeus* but notes that this correspondence appears to have been forgotten in *Epinomis*, which he calls \"a long step towards Aristotle's theory\", and he points out that Aristotle's ether is above the other four elements rather than on an equal footing with them, making the correspondence less apposite.\n5. **^** Weyl 1952, p. 74.\n6. **^** Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, sec 1.8 Configurations\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Meskhishvili, Mamuka (2020). \"Cyclic Averages of Regular Polygons and Platonic Solids\". *Communications in Mathematics and Applications*. **11**: 335–355. arXiv:2010.12340. doi:10.26713/cma.v11i3.1420 (inactive 1 August 2023).`{{cite journal}}`: CS1 maint: DOI inactive as of August 2023 (link)\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Jerrard, Richard P.; Wetzel, John E.; Yuan, Liping (April 2017). \"Platonic Passages\". *Mathematics Magazine*. **90** (2).
