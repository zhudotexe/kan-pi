Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la m\u00e1scara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017\u201318 league campaign, against Espanyol in *Derbi barcelon\u00ed*, thus helping to secure a 5\u20130 home victory for *Blaugrana* over local rivals.[226] Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Bar\u00e7a defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3\u20130 at home in the UEFA Champions League.[227] On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6\u20131 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga.[228] Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Bar\u00e7a defeat Las Palmas 3\u20130 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n185. **^** Rice, Simon (7 December 2015). \"Lionel Messi, Manchester United and Arsenal: The 10 Most Tweeted Sporting Moments of 2015\". *The Independent*.

A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2\u20130 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which \u2013 a slaloming dribble past three Real players \u2013 was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[108] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[109][110] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Bar\u00e7a's 3\u20131 victory.[111][112] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4\u20130 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2\u20130, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of \u20ac250\u00a0million, while his salary increased to \u20ac12\u00a0million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2003\u201304 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[31] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the *Juveniles* B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the *Juveniles A*, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[32][33] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous.

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice.

debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[37] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[44][45] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys in Montju\u00efc, coming on in the 82nd

by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[148] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3\u20131 home victory over Olympiacos.[230] Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart.[231] On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2\u20131 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.[232] Following the reception of his fourth Golden Boot, Messi signed a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November, keeping him with the club through the 2020\u201321 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2\u20130 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[376] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[377] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[378] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1\u20130 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[379] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[380]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004\u20132005: success at youth level[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIFFHS World's Best Player\n |\n| --- |\n| **Men's winners**\n* 1988: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1989: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1990: ![West Germany](image) Matth\u00e4us\n* 1991\u20132019: not awarded\n* 2020: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2021: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2022: ![Argentina](image) Messi\n* 2023: ![Norway](image) Haaland\n |\n| **Women's winners**\n- 2020: ![Denmark](image) Harder\n\n- 2021: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2022: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2023: ![Spain](image) Bonmat\u00ed\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bar\u00e7a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[19][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak\u00e1 and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak\u00e1.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007\u201308 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** Jenson, Pete (24 March 2014). \"Real Madrid 3 Barcelona 4 Match Report: Lionel Messi Hat-Trick Out-Guns Cristiano Ronaldo in Seven-Goal El Cl\u00e1sico Thriller\". *The Independent*.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pel\u00e9 as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[508] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3\u20130 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[509] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5\u20130 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s among the all-time international men's top scorers.[510]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of \u20ac7.8\u00a0million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66\u00a0yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[19][69] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[70] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[71][72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n644. **^** \"Lionel Messi's wife explains her absence at World Cup opener that left him broken hearted\". *USAHint*. 21 June 2018.

He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[662] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[663]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2008 UEFA Team of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK: Casillas\n* RB: Ramos\n* CB: Terry\n* CB: Puyol\n* LB: Lahm\n* MF: C.

Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice.

In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6\u20130 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[391] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0\u20130 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[392][393] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1\u20131. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n623. **^** Henry, Thierry (21 April 2011). \"The 2011 Time 100: Lionel Messi, God of the Field\". *Time*.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent *La Albiceleste* since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\u20130 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n370. **^** \"Inter Miami CF Signs Seven-Time Ballon d'Or Winner, World Cup Champion, Lionel Messi | Inter Miami CF\". *Inter Miami CF*. 15 July 2023.

During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of '87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[16][17] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[538][539]\n\n\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[540] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[541][542][543] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[532][544] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[545] the most among active players.[546] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[547]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[404] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[405] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2\u20131 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1\u20130 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2\u20131 win in extra time. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n320. **^** Thomas, Lyall; Solhekol, Kaveh (8 August 2021). \"Lionel Messi 'shocked' and 'surprised' at Barcelona contract collapse\". *Sky Sports*.

He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2\u20130 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[529] In the following match against Cura\u00e7ao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7\u20130 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.[530]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n364. **^** Balague, Guillem (7 June 2023). \"Lionel Messi to join Inter Miami after leaving Paris St-Germain\". *BBC Sport*.

He ended the season with the highest number of assists in the league with 16 and was also included in the UNFP's Ligue 1 Team of the Season alongside teammates Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Mbapp\u00e9.[362][363]\n\n\n\n### Inter Miami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Messi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup\nFollowing confirmation of his departure from PSG, Messi was linked with a return to former club Barcelona, as well as with a big-money move to Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal, but his eventual decision to sign for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami was communicated to Barcelona president Joan Laporta by 5 June 2023.[364][365] Barcelona were unable to sign him due to financial constraints.[366]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7\u20130 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[151] These matches gave credence to the notion of *Messidependencia*, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[151]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[16] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against *La Raz\u00f3n* newspaper and was awarded \u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[668] Messi made a donation worth \u20ac1\u00a0million ($1.1\u00a0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[669] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[670] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[671]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTowards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the *Juveniles* B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[32][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his debut for the club on 21 July in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a 2\u20131 victory.[374] After scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi opened the scoring in the 2023 Leagues Cup final against Nashville SC on 19 August before Nashville equalised in the second half. The game ended in a penalty shoot-out which Miami won, 10\u20139, with Messi scoring the first, giving the club their first ever trophy.[375]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[655] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The Best FIFA Men's Player | * 2016: ![Portugal](image) C.

At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 32 | 16 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 1[h] | 1 | 41 | 21\n |\n| Total\n | 58 | 22 | 2 | 0 | 14 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 75 | 32\n |\n| Inter Miami | 2023 | MLS | 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 7[i] | 10 | 14 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 615 | 508 | 83 | 56 | 163 | 129 | 37 | 33 | 899 | 726\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[672][673] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \u00a3125,000.[674]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[317] with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[318] On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day.[319] The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[320] Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi's exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\".[321] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[322]\n\n\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain[edit]\n\n\n#### 2021\u201322: first season adjustments and seventh Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He played as a forward for Ferencv\u00e1ros, Slovan Bratislava, Barcelona, and Espanyol, among other clubs. Regarded as one of the best players in history, Kubala is considered a hero of FC Barcelona.[2] A Hungarian national by birth, he also held Czechoslovak and Spanish citizenship, and played for the national teams of all three countries.[3][4][5]\n\n\nKubala was noted for his quick and skilful dribbling, composed and powerful finishing, and accuracy from free kicks. During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\nKubala was born in Budapest, as were his parents, who came from mixed backgrounds. His mother, Anna Stecz, a factory worker, had Polish, Slovak and Hungarian roots, while his father, P\u00e1l Kubala Kurjas, a bricklayer, belonged to the Slovak minority of Hungary. Kubala described himself as a \"cosmopolitan\". He began his career as a junior player with Ganz TE, a factory team that played in the Hungarian third division. At the age of 11, he was playing in teams with other players who were three to five years older.[8] At the age of 18, he signed for Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC where he was a teammate of S\u00e1ndor Kocsis. In 1946, Kubala moved to Czechoslovakia, allegedly to avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined \u0160K Slovan Bratislava. In 1947, he married Anna Viola Dau\u010d\u00edkova, the sister of the Czechoslovakian national coach, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk. In 1948, Kubala returned to Hungary, again to allegedly avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined Vasas SC.\n\n\n\n### Refugee[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1949, as Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a communist satellite state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck. Initially, he arrived in the United States zone of Allied-occupied Austria and then moved on to Italy, where he played briefly for Pro Patria. In May 1949, he also agreed to play for Torino in a testimonial against S.L. Benfica but pulled out after his son became ill. On the way back from Lisbon, the plane carrying the Torino team crashed into the Superga hills, killing all 31 people on board.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian Football Federation accused Kubala of breach of contract, leaving the country without permission, and failure to do military service. FIFA backed them and imposed a one-year international ban. In January 1950, Kubala, with Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk as coach, formed his own team, *Hungaria*, which was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. In the summer of 1950, the team arrived in Spain to play a series of friendlies against a Madrid XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espanyol. They also played a friendly game against the legendary Millonarios FC lead by Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[9][10]\n\n\nDuring these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Jos\u00e9 Samitier, then chief scout at FC Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was persuaded by Samitier to sign for Barcelona. Samitier used his connections within the government of Francisco Franco to help arrange the transfer. Franco's government wanted to utilize Kubala's status as a refugee from one of the USSR's satellite countries to reinforce the regime's validity, thus helping Kubala obtain Spanish citizenship without delay.[11] In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used as propaganda by Franco's government and was made into a successful film, *The Stars Search for Peace*, which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nKubala signed for FC Barcelona on 15 June 1950, and as part of the deal, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk also became the Barcelona coach. However, the ban imposed on Kubala was still in place and he did not make his La Liga debut until 1951. He was permitted to play friendlies, and in two consecutive games against Frankfurter S.V., which FC Barcelona won 4\u20131 and 10\u20134, he scored six goals and assisted another five. He also played in the Copa del General\u00edsimo and helped the club win the trophy in 1951.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kubala (center) with special guests Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (left) and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s in a match held in his honour in 1961\nIn his first La Liga season, 1951\u201352, Kubala scored 26 goals in 19 games. This included 7 goals in a 9\u20130 win over Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, five against Celta de Vigo and hat-tricks against Sevilla and Racing de Santander. His seven goals against Gij\u00f3n remain the record for most goals scored in a single match in La Liga. He also scored in the Copa del General\u00edsimo final as Barcelona beat Valencia 4\u20132. This season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Coach Dau\u010d\u00edk and Kubala, together with players like Emilio Aldecoa, Velasco, Joan Segarra and Ramallets, inspired the team to win five trophies, including La Liga, the Copa del General\u00edsimo, the Latin Cup, and the Copa Eva Duarte. Kubala missed much of the 1952\u201353 season after contracting tuberculosis, which threatened to end his playing career. However, he made a miraculous recovery and returned to help Barcelona retain both La Liga and the Copa del General\u00edsimo. He also scored again in the Copa final win, a 2\u20131 win over Athletic Bilbao. During his time with Barcelona, he scored a total of 14 hat-tricks.\n\n\nIn 1958, Kubala persuaded two fellow Hungarian refugees S\u00e1ndor Kocsis and Zolt\u00e1n Czibor to join him at Barcelona. Together with a young Luis Su\u00e1rez and Evaristo, they formed the nucleus of the team that won a La Liga / Copa del General\u00edsimo double in 1959 and a La Liga / Fairs Cup double in 1960. However, Kubala found himself out of favour with coach Helenio Herrera and lost his place in the team. As a result, he missed the 1960 European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid which Barcelona lost 6\u20132 on aggregate. The result saw Herrera lose his job and Kubala restored to the team. In the 1961 European Cup, Barcelona became the first club to beat Real Madrid in the competition. Inspired by Kubala they won 4\u20133 on aggregate and subsequently reached the final where they lost to Benfica 2\u20133. Kubala briefly retired as a player in 1961 and initially became a youth coach at Barcelona, before becoming coach of the senior team for the 1962\u201363 season. However, after losing a Fairs Cup game to Red Star Belgrade, he was dismissed. In the summer of 1963, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.[14]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Kubala in the grounds of the Camp Nou\nKubala played for three international teams \u2013 Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain. While playing with \u0160K Slovan Bratislava, he appeared in six games and scored four goals for Czechoslovakia between 1946 and 1947. After returning to Budapest in 1948, he played three games for Hungary but failed to score. After adopting Spanish nationality, Kubala played 19 times and scored 11 goals for Spain between 1953 and 1961, being one of a small group to have played for the country having been born elsewhere. The highlight of his international career was a hat-trick for Spain against Turkey in 3\u20130 win in November 1957.[15][16] Despite playing for three countries, Kubala never played in the finals of a major international tournament. He was included in the Spain squad for the 1962 World Cup but, along with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, did not play due to injury.\n\n\nAs well as playing for three international teams, Kubala also played for both a Europe XI and the Catalan XI. On 21 October 1953, England played a Europe XI at Wembley Stadium to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Football Association and Kubala scored twice in the 4\u20134 draw. He also played four games and scored four times for the Catalan XI. On 26 January 1955, in a game against Bologna at Les Corts, he was joined by guest player Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano; the Catalan XI won 6\u20132 with two goals from Kubala and one from Di St\u00e9fano. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 4 March 1993 at the Montju\u00efc Stadium against an International XI. He played the opening ten minutes of the game at age 65.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Kubala accepted a contract as a player-coach with RCD Espanyol and teamed up with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. During his time at Espanyol he gave a La Liga debut to his son, Branko. In 1966, he joined FC Z\u00fcrich, again as player-coach, and made his last appearance in a European Cup game against the competition's eventual winners, Celtic. In 1967, Kubala went to Canada, where at Toronto Falcons he enjoyed something of family reunion with his father-in-law, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk, his brother-in-law, Yanko Daucik and his son Branko. He appeared in 19 matches for Toronto, scoring five times.[17]\n\n\nBy the end of 1968, he had returned to La Liga, and after a brief spell at C\u00f3rdoba CF, he became coach of the Spain national team. Kubala ended the team's 11-year absence from the World Cup when he guided the team to the 1978 World Cup, but could not steer them through the first-round group stage. He also managed them at Euro 80, where they were again eliminated in the first round.\n\n\nIn 1980, he returned to Barcelona as a manager for a second short spell before moving to Saudi Arabia where he managed Al-Hilal. He subsequently managed three other La Liga clubs, including CD M\u00e1laga whom he guided to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n title in 1988. His last coaching position was with Paraguay in 1995.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\n| Club\n | Season\n | League\n | Cup\n | Continental\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals\n |\n| Ganz TE\n | 1943\u201344[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II | 9 | 2 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 2\n |\n| Ferencv\u00e1rosi | 1944[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1945[20] | 22 | 19 |  |  |  |  | 22 | 19\n |\n| 1945\u201346[20] | 27 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 27 | 14\n |\n| Total\n | 49 | 33 |  |  |  |  | 49 | 33\n |\n| Slovan Bratislava | 1946\u201347[20] | Czechoslovak First League | 24 | 13 |  |  |  |  | 24 | 13\n |\n| 1947\u201348[20] | 9 | 1 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 33 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 33 | 14\n |\n| Vasas | 1948\u201349[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I\n | 20 | 10 |  |  |  |  | 20 | 10\n |\n| 1949\u201350[20] | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 6\n |\n| Total\n | 32 | 16 |  |  |  |  | 32 | 16\n |\n| Pro Patria | 1949\u201350[20] | Serie A | 16 | 9 |  |  |  |  | 16 | 9\n |\n| Hung\u00e1ria\n | 1950\u201351[20] |  | 6 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 6 | 5\n |\n| Barcelona | 1951\u201352[20][21] | La Liga | 19 | 26 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 26\n |\n| 1952\u201353[20][21] | 11 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 11 | 7\n |\n| 1953\u201354[20][21] | 28 | 23 |  |  |  |  | 28 | 23\n |\n| 1954\u201355[20][21] | 19 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 14\n |\n| 1955\u201356[20][21] | 25 | 14 |  |  | 3[a] | 3 | 28 | 17\n |\n| 1956\u201357[21] | 18 | 9 | 1 | 0 |  |  | 19 | 9\n |\n| 1957\u201358[21] | 21 | 12 |  |  |  |  | 21 | 12\n |\n| 1958\u201359[20][21] | 20 | 9 |  |  | 5[a] | 3 | 25 | 12\n |\n| 1959\u201360[20][21] | 12 | 7 |  |  | 3[b] | 6 | 15 | 13\n |\n| 1960\u201361[20][21] | 13 | 10 |  |  | 9[c] | 1 | 22 | 11\n |\n| Total\n | 186 | 131 | 1 | 0 | 20 | 13 | 207 | 144\n |\n| Toronto City | 1962[20] | ECPSL |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Espanyol | 1963\u201364[20][21] | La Liga\n | 29 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 29 | 7\n |\n| Z\u00fcrich | 1965\u201366[20] | Nationalliga A | 12 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 7\n |\n| 1966\u201367[20][21] | 0 | 0 |  |  | 1[b] | 0 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 12 | 7 |  |  | 1 | 0 | 13 | 7\n |\n| Toronto Falcons | 1967[20] | NPSL | 19 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 5\n |\n| Career total\n | 391 | 229 | 1 | 0 | 21 | 13 | 413 | 242\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in European Cup\n3. **^** Eight appearances and one goal in European Cup, one appearance in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[21]\n| National team | Year | Apps | Goals\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Czechoslovakia | 1946 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1947 | 5 | 4\n |\n| Total | 6 | 4\n |\n| Hungary | 1948 | 3 | 0\n |\n| Total | 3 | 0\n |\n| Spain | 1953 | 3 | 1\n |\n| 1954 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1955 | 2 | 0\n |\n| 1956 | 4 | 4\n |\n| 1957 | 2 | 4\n |\n| 1958 | 3 | 2\n |\n| 1959 | 3 | 0\n |\n| 1960 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 1961 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total | 19 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 28\n | 15\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n**Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1951\u201352, 1952\u201353, 1958\u201359, 1959\u201360\n* Copa del General\u00edsimo: 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1959\n* Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: 1955\u201358, 1958\u201360\n* Latin Cup: 1952\n* Copa Eva Duarte: 1952, 1953\n* European Cup runner-up: 1960-61\n\n\n**Individual**\n\n\n\n* Ballon d'Or: fifth place 1957\n\n\n### Manager[edit]\n\n\n**M\u00e1laga**\n\n\n\n* Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 1987\u201388\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gaarskj\u00e6r, Jesper (2010). *Bar\u00e7a: Historien om FC Barcelona*.

Nicknamed \"***El Pistolero\"*** ('The Gunman'), Su\u00e1rez is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest strikers of all time.[2] He has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot and a Pichichi Trophy, and has scored over 500 career goals for club and country.[3]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Su\u00e1rez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth \u00a364.98 million (\u20ac82.3 million adjusted for inflation), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.\n\n\nDubbed *MSN*, Su\u00e1rez was part of a dominant trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, winning the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in his first season. In his second season, he won the Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[4] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.[5][6] With Barcelona, Su\u00e1rez won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2020, winning his fifth La Liga title in his second season.[7]\n\n\nAt international level, Su\u00e1rez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, and formerly held the title of highest scorer in CONMEBOL FIFA World Cup qualifiers before being surpassed by former teammate Lionel Messi.[8] He has represented his nation at four editions of the FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named in the 2010 World Cup All-Star Team and won the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was awarded Best Player. Outside of his football credentials, Su\u00e1rez has been a source of controversy throughout his career,[note 1] including a goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, biting opponents on three occasions,[note 2] accusations of diving,[16][17] and racial incidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Youth[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"As I was growing up, there was only one player I looked up to, and that was Batistuta, the Argentina No.9.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Su\u00e1rez on his childhood idol, Gabriel Batistuta.[18]\n\nSu\u00e1rez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo Artigas.[19] At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he played youth football at Urreta.[20] When he was a child, a car ran over his foot, breaking the fifth metatarsal bone. In spite of the injury, he continued to play.[21]\n\n\n\n### Nacional[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez joined local side Nac's youth team at age 14.[22] At age 16, Su\u00e1rez headbutted a referee after showing his discontent following a red card, although a sports editor claimed he \"accidentally fell into the referee\".[23] One night, he was caught drinking and partying, prompting his coach to threaten he would never play unless he started playing football more seriously.[22] In May 2005, at age 18, Su\u00e1rez made his first-team debut against Atl\u00e9tico Junior in the Copa Libertadores.[22] He scored his first goal in September 2005[24] and helped Nacional win the 2005\u201306 Uruguayan league with 10 goals in 27 matches.[25]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club Groningen when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a \"wonder goal\" against Defensor. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Su\u00e1rez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional \u20ac800,000 for him.[22] Su\u00e1rez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sof\u00eda Balbi, had moved to Barcelona; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Groningen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez on the training field of Groningen in 2006\nSu\u00e1rez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Su\u00e1rez struggled because he could not speak Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game.[26] His teammate and fellow Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, and his teammate R\u00f9fson, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team.[26] He worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language.[26] Su\u00e1rez scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007, he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card.[27] Su\u00e1rez especially made his mark in a 4\u20133 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two goals.[28] Su\u00e1rez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances[29] to help Groningen finish eighth in the 2006\u201307 Eredivisie.[26] He also scored in a 4\u20132 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut on 14 September 2006.[26][30]\n\n\nAjax saw potential in Su\u00e1rez and offered Groningen \u20ac3.5\u00a0million for him, but Groningen rejected the offer.[31] Su\u00e1rez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale.[31] The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to \u20ac7.5\u00a0million and Groningen accepted.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Ajax[edit]\n\n\n#### 2007\u201309: Development and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 August 2007 Su\u00e1rez signed a five-year contract with Ajax, for a transfer fee of \u20ac7.5 million,[31][33] and made his club debut in the UEFA Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague.[34] He scored one goal in his Eredivisie debut for the club[35] and two goals in his home debut at the Amsterdam Arena.[36] Ajax finished second in the league table in the 2007\u201308 season[37] and Su\u00e1rez scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances, setting up a blossoming striking partnership with league top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.[38]\n\n\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Ajax head coach Marco van Basten noted how Su\u00e1rez played an important role in many of Ajax's goals, but Van Basten was also upset by the number of yellow cards Su\u00e1rez received.[35] Su\u00e1rez was suspended for one match[39] because he was given his seventh yellow card of the season against Utrecht in a 2\u20130 win.[40] He was also suspended after a half-time altercation with teammate Albert Luque over a free kick.[27][35] Ajax ended the season in third place.[41] Su\u00e1rez scored 22 goals in 31 league matches[35][38] and finished second in scoring tables, one goal behind Mounir El Hamdaoui of AZ.[42] Su\u00e1rez was also named Ajax Player of the Year.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: League top goal scorer, Eredivisie winner[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (with the Ajax pennant) as Ajax captain in 2010.

Ajax suspended him for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount, which the club said they would donate to a \"good cause\".[58] The Dutch daily newspaper *De Telegraaf* branded Su\u00e1rez the \"Cannibal of Ajax\".[12][56] The KNVB increased Su\u00e1rez's suspension to seven league matches.[59] Su\u00e1rez apologized for his actions through a video he uploaded to his Facebook page.[56]\n\n\n\n### Liverpool[edit]\n\n\n#### Transfer[edit]\n\n\nDuring the suspension, Ajax were in contact with other European clubs interested in Su\u00e1rez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a \u20ac26.5\u00a0million (\u00a322.8\u00a0million) offer for Su\u00e1rez from Premier League club Liverpool.[60][61][62] Despite leaving while suspended, Su\u00e1rez departed Ajax on good terms, and he was given a farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club wished he could stay longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed.[63] Ajax ended the 2010\u201311 season as Eredivisie champions[64] and Su\u00e1rez was given a winner's medal[25][65] for his 7 goals in 13 appearances.[66]\n\n\nOn 31 January 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with Liverpool until 2016,[60][67] and was the club's most expensive signing (\u00a322.8\u00a0million) until the arrival of Andy Carroll (\u00a335\u00a0million) a few hours later.[68] Su\u00e1rez requested the number seven shirt, which had been worn by Liverpool legends Kenny Dalglish, his new manager, Kevin Keegan, and Peter Beardsley[69]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u201312: Early seasons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (left) was signed by Liverpool on the same day as Andy Carroll.\nSu\u00e1rez made his Liverpool debut on 2 February against Stoke City at Anfield in a 2\u20130 win; he came on as a substitute and scored Liverpool's second goal in front of the Kop in the 79th minute.[68][70] He was one of Liverpool's best players during his partial season[71][72] and helped Liverpool go from 12th in the league in mid-January[71] to finish sixth.[73] He finished the 2010\u201311 season with four goals in 13 games.[66]\n\n\nAfter winning the Player of the Tournament at the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica,[74] Su\u00e1rez had a disappointing 2011\u201312 season by his standards.[75] Liverpool finished in eighth place and Su\u00e1rez scored 11 league goals.[75] On 26 February, Liverpool won the League Cup, defeating Cardiff City in a penalty shootout.[76] On 28 April, Su\u00e1rez scored his first Liverpool hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win against Norwich City at Carrow Road.[77] He finished sixth for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Racial abuse incident[edit]\n\n\nThe season was marked by an incident in which Su\u00e1rez was found guilty by a three-man panel from The Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October; he was issued an eight-match suspension and a \u00a340,000 fine.[79] Su\u00e1rez disputed this decision.[80]\n\n\nAfter a 1\u20131 draw against Manchester United on 15 October 2011, Su\u00e1rez was accused of racially abusing Evra,[81] and the FA opened up an investigation into the incident.[81] Su\u00e1rez wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages that he was upset by the accusation and denied the claims.[82] On 16 November, the FA announced it would charge Su\u00e1rez with \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules\", including \"a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra\". Liverpool later released a statement announcing Su\u00e1rez would plead innocent, adding they would \"remain fully supportive\" of him.[83] On 20 December, the FA concluded a seven-day hearing, handing Su\u00e1rez an eight-match ban and a \u00a340,000 fine for racially abusing Evra.[84][85][86]\n\n\nIn their next meeting in February, during the pregame handshakes, Su\u00e1rez avoided shaking Evra's hand, for which Su\u00e1rez and Dalglish were later forced to apologise.[87] Su\u00e1rez was also banned for one match for making an obscene gesture towards Fulham fans.[88]\n\n\n\n#### 2012\u201313: Return and individual success[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 August 2012, Su\u00e1rez signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool.[89] On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the 2012\u201313 season in a 2\u20132 draw with champions Manchester City at Anfield.[90] On 29 September 2012, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick in Liverpool's Premier League fixture away at Norwich City for the second consecutive season.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez playing for Liverpool against Arsenal in January 2013\nOn 6 January 2013, Su\u00e1rez handled the ball before scoring the decisive goal in Liverpool's 2\u20131 win over Mansfield Town from the Conference National in an FA Cup third round match. Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player by claiming \"it's not his job to own up\", while Mansfield manager Paul Cox said he felt \"a little bit gutted\" by the \"instinctive\" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.[92]\n\n\nOn 19 January, Su\u00e1rez scored his seventh goal in three matches against Norwich, as Liverpool cruised to a 5\u20130 home league victory.[93] The following week, Su\u00e1rez captained Liverpool for the first time for the FA Cup fourth round match against Oldham Athletic; Liverpool lost 2\u20133.[94] On 2 March, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic, leading Liverpool to a dominant 4\u20130 victory at the DW Stadium. In so doing, he became only the third Liverpool player to score 20 Premier League goals in a single season after Robbie Fowler and Fernando Torres.[95] On 10 March, Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th goal in all competitions since joining *the Reds* by scoring the opener in a 3\u20132 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ending Spurs' 12-match unbeaten run. He was also named man of the match for his performance after he won the decisive penalty which Steven Gerrard converted.\n\n\nAt the end of the season, Su\u00e1rez was one of six players named on the shortlist for PFA Players' Player of the Year.[96] Su\u00e1rez finished second in the final ballot behind Gareth Bale of Tottenham[97] and was named in the PFA Team of the Year.[97] He was second-top goalscorer in the Premier League for 2012\u201313 with 23 goals and Liverpool's top scorer in all competitions with 30 goals.[98] On 28 May 2013, he was named as Liverpool's player of the season after receiving 64% of votes in a poll of the club's supporters.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez about to score a 35-yard free kick against Zenit Saint Petersburg, his second goal in a 3\u20131 win, March 2013\n#### Second biting incident[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2013, during a 2\u20132 draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield, Su\u00e1rez bit Branislav Ivanovi\u0107; this was the second time Su\u00e1rez had bitten an opponent.[100] It was not noticed by the officials, and Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer in injury time.[13] The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Su\u00e1rez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club.[101] Contrary to claims from Su\u00e1rez, Ivanovi\u0107 did not accept an apology.[101] Su\u00e1rez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence.[102] A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Su\u00e1rez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticized Su\u00e1rez for not appreciating \"the seriousness\" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game \u2013 especially to young players\".[103]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2013, Su\u00e1rez said he would be seeking an exit from Liverpool in the summer, citing excessive media attention on his family as a reason for wanting to leave.[104] On 6 August, after Liverpool had rejected a bid of \u00a340,000,001 for the player from Arsenal, Su\u00e1rez reiterated his wish to leave Liverpool and said Liverpool had previously promised to allow him a transfer if the club failed to qualify for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League.[105] The following day, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool had not broken any promises to Su\u00e1rez and that the player had shown \"total disrespect\" for the club.[106] After this incident, the British press reported that Su\u00e1rez had been instructed to train away from the Liverpool first-team squad by Rodgers.[106][107][108] On 8 August, Liverpool owner John W. Henry stated that Su\u00e1rez would not be allowed to leave the club.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u201314: European Golden Shoe and departure[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 August, Su\u00e1rez reversed his position about wanting to leave the club, with reports stating he wanted to stay at the club and that he was possibly going to sign a contract extension, citing the support from Liverpool supporters as the reason for his unexpected turnaround.[110][111] Su\u00e1rez returned to first-team training two days later after \"offer[ing] contrition\" to his teammates but reportedly not apologizing to his manager.[112] On 25 September, Su\u00e1rez returned to the Liverpool team after his suspension to make his first appearance of the 2013\u201314 season in a League Cup third round tie against Manchester United at Old Trafford, losing 1\u20130.[113][114] On 29 September, Su\u00e1rez made his first Premier League appearance of the season, scoring twice as Liverpool defeated Sunderland 3\u20131 at the Stadium of Light.[115] On 26 October, he scored his fourth Premier League hat-trick, his first at Anfield, in a 4\u20131 defeat of West Bromwich Albion.[116]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"He [Su\u00e1rez] has shown in his time at Liverpool in the last year or so that he is near unplayable.

His second broke a tie in the 80th minute when he dribbled around a defender and curled a \"spectacular shot\"[281] in off the far post; Su\u00e1rez was again named Man of the Match.[281] This win put Uruguay through to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970.[282] In the quarter-final against Ghana, the score was 1\u20131 at the end of regulation and the match went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free-kick into the box, and Su\u00e1rez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line.[283] He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goal bound header with his hands,[284] committing a professional foul[56] to save what would have been the game winner[285] and was sent off. Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar with the ensuing penalty kick[283] and Su\u00e1rez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading down the tunnel.[286][287] Uruguay won the shootout 4\u20132 and advanced to the semi-finals.[283][288]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"The Hand of God now belongs to me. Mine is the real Hand of God.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014After using his hand in the quarter-final against Ghana, Su\u00e1rez referred to Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal against England in 1986.[289]\n\nAfter the match, Su\u00e1rez said, \"I made the save of the tournament.\"[285] He said he had no alternative, was acting out of instinct, and would do it again if it helped his team win.[290] Ghana head coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an \"injustice\"[286] and Su\u00e1rez was labelled a villain and a cheater.[291][290] Others viewed him as a hero.[56][292] Due to the automatic suspension that accompanies a red card, Su\u00e1rez sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance the penalty would be missed, and his team would later win.[27][291]\n\n\nWhile Su\u00e1rez was suspended for the semi-final match for his red card against Ghana,[293] Uruguay \"lacked a second striker [alongside Diego Forl\u00e1n] of cunning and movement\"[294] and lost 3\u20132 to the Netherlands.[295][296] Su\u00e1rez returned for the third place game against Germany; he was booed almost every time he had the ball because of his handball in the Ghana match.[297] He assisted Cavani on Uruguay's first goal,[298] but Uruguay lost 3\u20132.[297] During the tournament, Su\u00e1rez played 543 minutes in six appearances and scored three goals.[299]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez was named most valuable player of the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica\nIn the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Su\u00e1rez scored in Uruguay's opening game, a 1\u20131 draw with Peru.[300] In their next game, he provided the assist for Alvaro Pereira's goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Chile.[301] Uruguay finished second in their group and advanced to the knockout round[302] with a win, 1\u20130 against Mexico, and two draws, against Peru and Chile.[303] In the quarter-finals, Uruguay drew with tournament hosts Argentina 1\u20131 after regulation and extra time. Uruguay won the shootout 5\u20134 and Su\u00e1rez converted his penalty.[304][305] Su\u00e1rez scored both goals in Uruguay's 2\u20130 semi-final win over Peru and was named Man of the Match.[306] In the final, Su\u00e1rez scored the opening goal and set up Diego Forlan's second goal as Uruguay defeated Paraguay 3\u20130 for their record 15th Copa Am\u00e9rica title.[307][308] Su\u00e1rez scored four goals and provided two assists during the tournament and was named MVP of the Tournament.[307][43][309]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 July 2012, Su\u00e1rez was selected for the Uruguay Olympic football team alongside Liverpool teammate Sebasti\u00e1n Coates to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games.[310] In the first pre-tournament warm-up game against Chile on 11 July, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick for Uruguay as they came from 0\u20132 down to win 6\u20134 in a thrilling match.[311]\n\n\nAs one of Uruguay's three overage players, Su\u00e1rez was named as captain for the Olympic Games.[312] After an opening win over the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay were defeated by Senegal and Great Britain and eliminated at the first round. Su\u00e1rez failed to score during the tournament.\n\n\n\n### 2013 Confederations Cup[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was selected in the Uruguay squad to play in Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup. He scored a curling free-kick from 30 yards (27\u00a0m) in a 2\u20131 defeat to Spain in their opening match at Recife on 16 June.[313] He then scored twice after appearing as a substitute in Uruguay's 8\u20130 win over Tahiti, making him the Uruguay national team's all-time top-goalscorer with 35 goals, surpassing his teammate Diego Forl\u00e1n.[314] Uruguay were eventually eliminated in the semi-finals, losing 2\u20131 to Brazil in Belo Horizonte.[315]\n\n\n\n### 2014 FIFA World Cup, third biting incident[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (middle) celebrating one of his two goals against England at the 2014 World Cup\nSu\u00e1rez ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the South American section with 11 goals in 14 matches.[316] In November 2013, Uruguay defeated Jordan 5\u20130 on aggregate in an intercontinental play-off to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.[317]\n\n\nOn 22 May, Su\u00e1rez underwent emergency surgery on his left knee. He was confined to a wheelchair for a time, leading to rumours he would be unable to participate in the World Cup.[318][319][320] He was named as a substitute for Uruguay's first match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Costa Rica, but did not play in the match. Su\u00e1rez started Uruguay's second match against England and scored both of the team's goals in a 2\u20131 win at the Arena Corinthians in S\u00e3o Paulo.[321]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"These are just things that happen out on the pitch.

I apologize to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be another incident like [this].\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Su\u00e1rez on 30 June 2014.[324]\n\nFor Uruguay's final group match against Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the knockout stage while Italy only needed a draw.[325] Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0\u20130, Su\u00e1rez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Su\u00e1rez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Su\u00e1rez falling and clutching his face.[14][326] The controversial incident made headline news around the world.[327] As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez for not penalizing Su\u00e1rez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1\u20130 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.[14][326][328]\n\n\nTwo days later, on 26 June, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, banned Su\u00e1rez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup.[145][329] He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000.[145][329] The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Su\u00e1rez's defense that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was \"deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilizing him\". The severity of the penalty was due to the fact it was Su\u00e1rez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse.[323] Soon after the suspension was announced, online gambling firm 888poker cancelled its sponsorship deal with Su\u00e1rez.[330] With Su\u00e1rez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 0\u20132 to Colombia and were eliminated from the World Cup.[331]\n\n\nOn the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal the suspension.[332] Su\u00e1rez's lawyer said that \"we don't have any doubts\" of a European-based campaign against Su\u00e1rez.[333] Various Uruguayan individuals defended Su\u00e1rez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticized the severity of his ban, including President of Uruguay Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who labelled the ban \"fascist\" and called FIFA \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\";[334][335] AUF president Wilmar Valdez;[332] Uruguay captain Diego Lugano;[336] and Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest of the ban.[337] The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood.[338] For non-Uruguayan parties, Chiellini, who was bitten, called the ban \"excessive\", while international players' union FIFPro called for Su\u00e1rez to \"receive all the support he needs\" and that the \"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\" of Su\u00e1rez.[337]\n\n\nSix days after the incident, on 30 June, Su\u00e1rez apologized to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini.[324][339] Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Su\u00e1rez's suspension.[339][340]\n\n\nOn 3 July, the AUF appealed Su\u00e1rez's ban,[341] but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July.[342][343] With Su\u00e1rez's ban not preventing him from transferring to another club,[344] it was announced on 11 July that Su\u00e1rez had agreed to move to Barcelona.[345][346][347] Days before the transfer, Su\u00e1rez's apology to Chiellini had been praised by various Barcelona club individuals. Barcelona club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \"honorable\", sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Su\u00e1rez as being \"humble enough to admit an error\" while new signing Ivan Rakiti\u0107 commended Su\u00e1rez's \"character and strength\".[348][349]\n\n\n\n### Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario and 2018 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez playing against Portugal in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup\nOn 25 March 2016, after over a year of international absence for Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer against Brazil in Recife for a 2\u20132 draw in the qualification process for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[350] Su\u00e1rez was included in Uruguay's 23-man squad for the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, although a hamstring injury sustained in the Copa del Rey final on 22 May put his place in the team in jeopardy.[180][179] Although he remained in the squad, he missed both of his national side's opening group losses to Mexico and Venezuela, which resulted in a first-round elimination from the tournament.[351] He was once again left on the substitutes' bench in Uruguay's final 3\u20130 group win over Jamaica on 13 June.[352]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez scored twice on 10 October 2017 as Uruguay won 4\u20132 at home to Bolivia in their final World Cup qualifying match, thus securing their place for the tournament in Russia, as well as becoming the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Argentina's Lionel Messi, overtaking the previous record which was held by Hern\u00e1n Crespo.[353][354] In March, Uruguay won the 2018 China Cup, and Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th international goal with a penalty against the Czech Republic in the semi-finals, winning it himself when fouled by goalkeeper Ji\u0159\u00ed Pavlenka.[355] He won his 100th cap on 20 June 2018 in Uruguay's second group match at the World Cup, scoring the only goal against Saudi Arabia at the Rostov Arena in Rostov-on-Don to advance the nation into the last 16, for which Su\u00e1rez was given man of the match.[356] In the final group game on 25 June, Su\u00e1rez was again named the man of the match as he scored Uruguay's opener with a free kick into the bottom corner in a 3\u20130 win over hosts Russia.[357] In the Round of 16 match against Portugal on 30 June, he set-up Cavani's opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 victory.[358] Uruguay were eliminated from the tournament following a 2\u20130 defeat to France in the quarter-finals on 6 July.[359]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u20132020: Qualifiers and Copa Am\u00e9rica upset[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, manager Tab\u00e1rez included Su\u00e1rez in the final 23-man Uruguay squad for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[360] On 16 June, he scored the third goal in a 4\u20130 win over Ecuador in the team's opening group match of the tournament, also setting up the opener scored by Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro.[361]\n\n\nIn the quarter-finals against Peru on 29 June, he had a goal disallowed by VAR for offside, and was subsequently the only player to miss his spot-kick in the resulting penalty shoot-out, following a 0\u20130 draw after regulation time, which saw Uruguay eliminated from the competition.[362]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2020, Su\u00e1rez scored the first goal of the South American 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, becoming the first player ever to score the opening goal three times (after his 2010 and 2014 strikes) in the competition's history.[363]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present: Copa Am\u00e9rica and 2022 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 June 2021, Su\u00e1rez scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Chile in Uruguay's second group match of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[364] However, Uruguay lost against Colombia in the quarter-finals on penalties after a goalless draw.[365]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2022, in Uruguay's final group match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar against Ghana, Su\u00e1rez assisted Giorgian de Arrascaeta's second goal of the match to give Uruguay a 2\u20130 win; however, group rivals South Korea scored a late goal to win 2\u20131 against Portugal, advancing from the group stage having scored four goals to Uruguay\u2019s two (both teams were tied at 4 points and a 0 goal difference).[366]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez in action for Liverpool takes on Sylvain Distin of Everton during the Merseyside Derby in 2012\nSu\u00e1rez creates goal scoring chances with his powerful shot, and has \"remarkable technical ability\" according to his FIFA profile.[367] Known for his direct running at players, Su\u00e1rez has a particular penchant for nutmegging opponents (putting the ball through their legs).[368] Liverpool fans (accompanied with a banner) used to say he was so good, \"he could nutmeg a mermaid\".[369] Often regarded by many as one of the best strikers of all time,[note 3] Su\u00e1rez is a prolific goal scorer, having the rare distinction of being the leading scorer in three top-flight European leagues, a feat only matched by Ruud van Nistelrooy[376] and Cristiano Ronaldo.[377] An accurate finisher[378] with either foot,[379] despite being naturally right-footed,[380] he is capable of scoring from both inside[381] and outside the penalty area.[382]\n\n\nHarry Redknapp said that Su\u00e1rez could play anywhere \u2013 as the target man or behind as a second striker. Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez called Su\u00e1rez \"a great forward, an elite player among forwards in the world\",[383] and Liverpool coach Kenny Dalglish said, \"he's intelligent, he's had a fantastic education at Ajax\".[384] Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said his abilities allow him to get into a position to score and evade defenders.[385][386] Meanwhile, Thierry Henry called Su\u00e1rez the best striker in the world, stating, \"He has everything. He's in your face, he's arrogant- in a good way, he can volley it, he can score headers. He has vicious side to his game and I will not call it cheating. He knows how to score goals.\"[387]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been praised for his work rate,[385] movement,[388] and his quickness[384] that allows him to attack from the outside;[367] as such he occasionally played as an inverted winger on the left flank during his time with Ajax.[389] Additionally, Su\u00e1rez has a liking for often executing dummies (going around the defenders with a fake-out) within his style of dribbling.[390] During his time in Barcelona, he was known for constantly scoring through volleys or half-volleys.[391][392] Su\u00e1rez also gained a reputation for consistently scoring acrobatic goals, often shooting off balance, or in air, or with overhead bicycle kicks.[393][394][395] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick taker,[396] and has also been known to take penalties.[397]\n\n\nHe also creates many scoring opportunities for his teammates with his vision and great passing abilities, as is reflected in his numbers of assists, among the very highest within the stat's recorded history.[398] Former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, lauded Su\u00e1rez's unselfish playstyle within his autobiography, stating how that \"It's a rare combination, to be a miraculous footballer who is willing to use his gifts to selflessly assist and create goals for a teammate\", as well as further writing, \"He scores goals. He creates goals. He's hard and horrible to play against. You've got a chance of beating anyone in the world with Luis Su\u00e1rez in your team\".[399][400]\n\n\nIn addition to being a prolific player, Su\u00e1rez has often been praised for his strong mentality and desire to win. Former Liverpool teammate, Jordan Henderson dubbed Su\u00e1rez as a \"warrior\", claiming that his attitude inspired confidence among his teammates.[401] Meanwhile, Gerrard eulogized his drive to succeed, stating \"Luis played to win a five-a-side training session like he was chasing the Champions League or the World Cup. If his team lost a kickaround he went home angry; he always needed to win that badly\".[400] Atletico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone hailed Su\u00e1rez for the \"desire and energy\" he brought to the club.[402] Su\u00e1rez, himself, has stated that he's the kind of player who would \"kill himself just to prevent a throw-in at the 90th minute.\" in his autobiography.[403]\n\n\nFormer Ajax coach Marco van Basten criticized Su\u00e1rez for his tendency to receive yellow cards.[35] Van Basten said he had a tense relationship with Su\u00e1rez,[35] although he conceded that \"Luis is unpredictable, he's hard to influence but that makes him special.\"[35] At times, Su\u00e1rez can be dominant but fail to convert his efforts into goals.[404] Despite his weaknesses, Su\u00e1rez's leadership stood out to Ajax management.[60]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been widely accused of diving.[note 4] His manager, teammates and various analysts have commented that this reputation for simulation has caused referees not to award him legitimate penalties.[408][409] In January 2013, Su\u00e1rez admitted to diving against Stoke City in an October 2012 match. This led his manager Brendan Rodgers to comment his actions were \"unacceptable\" and that he would be dealt with \"internally\" by the club.[410] During the 2018 World Cup game against Portugal, after collisions with Portuguese players, Suarez twice acted like he had a head injury despite his head having been untouched.[411]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez is infamous for biting opponents on multiple occasions. In a Group D matchup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Suarez was shown to have bitten Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, resulting in FIFA suspending Suarez from all football activities for 4 months. While playing for Liverpool, Suarez bit Chelsea player Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 in a Premier League match, and was punished with a ten match ban. In an earlier incident while playing for AFC Ajax he was caught biting PSV Eindhoven player Otman Bakkal and was suspended for seven games.[100] Su\u00e1rez has also been accused of stamping on opponents in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League.[412][413][414][415]\n\n\nDue to his diving, biting, stamping, and other antics, Su\u00e1rez has been frequently labelled as a pest and a cheat.[416] In December 2013, Spanish football website *El Gol Digital* ranked Su\u00e1rez at fifth in its list of the world's dirtiest footballers.[417]\n\n\n\n## Media and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Previously with Adidas, Su\u00e1rez has been sponsored by Puma since 2018. He wears Puma Future 2.1.\nSu\u00e1rez had a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas, before switching to rivals Puma in 2018.[418] Su\u00e1rez starred in a 2014 advert for Beats with other global football stars including Neymar and Thierry Henry, with the theme of \"The Game Before the Game\" and the players' pre-game ritual of listening to music.[419] In Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez has also appeared in advertisements for Abitab, Antel, Cablevisi\u00f3n, Garnier, Pepsi and Samsung.[420][421]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez features in EA Sports' *FIFA* video game series: as a result of Su\u00e1rez's ban for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup, players in *FIFA 15* were unable to select Su\u00e1rez until his ban ended on 26 October.[422]\n\n\nActive on social media, Su\u00e1rez has over 40 million Instagram followers as of May 2020, the most for a person from Uruguay.[423][424]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was born in Salto, Uruguay to Sandra Diaz and Rodolfo Su\u00e1rez, the fourth of seven boys.[27][425] His older brother, Paolo Su\u00e1rez, is a retired professional footballer, who last played for Isidro Metap\u00e1n in El Salvador.\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez moved with his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.[425] In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,[24][425] while also taking up work as a street sweeper at the age of 15.[23] In 1998, aged 11 he appeared as a contestant on children's game show *Aventujuegos*, with his team winning: his episode was brought up in a 2011 episode of chat show *Noche de Locura* and he was surprised the footage had been kept.[3]\n\n\nThe contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.[23] Besides his native tongue, Su\u00e1rez is able to speak Dutch and English.[426][427]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mural of Su\u00e1rez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay\nSu\u00e1rez is of mixed race and has a black grandfather.[428] The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the Patrice Evra incident, where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of \"*mi negrito*\" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Su\u00e1rez's repeated use of \"negro\" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable, issuing him an eight-match ban. His mother also supported the claim Su\u00e1rez made that using the word was not racist in Uruguay. She said it was \"normal\", and that it was \"a word people use with their friends. It's like calling someone fat, thin or whatever.\"[429]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began dating Sof\u00eda Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to Barcelona in 2003, and Su\u00e1rez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sof\u00eda again.[23] Su\u00e1rez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter named Delfina (born 2010) [430]and two sons named Benjamin (born 2013) and Lauti (born 2018).[431][27][432] He has a tattoo of his daughter's name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his goal celebration \u2013 this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports\u2019 video game *FIFA 15* as \"Kiss The Wrist\".[433][434] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer to Sof\u00eda's family. On the move, Su\u00e1rez said, \"[Liverpool] did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right.\"[435] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez released his autobiography, *Crossing the Line \u2013 My Story*.[436][437]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez, who is married to an Italian citizen, was eligible to take a B1 Italian Language exam and flew to Perugia in September 2020 to take the test and gain Italian citizenship. Though obtaining the results of the language exam and approval of citizenship takes several months and several years respectively to be processed, Su\u00e1rez reportedly got his language exam results within hours and would have his citizenship approved in several weeks. The Italian media had noted that this led to accusations of special treatment against Su\u00e1rez, especially as Italian laws had been changed in 2018 to make obtaining citizenship by marriage more difficult.[438] In September 2020, an investigation was launched over accusations that he had cheated his way into gaining Italian citizenship.[234]\n\n\nIt is known that Su\u00e1rez has used his experience and knowledge to mentor new Uruguayan footballing talents, most notably Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.[439]\n\n\n\n### Pandora Papers[edit]\n\n\nHe is among the 13 sports personalities mentioned

Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la m\u00e1scara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017\u201318 league campaign, against Espanyol in *Derbi barcelon\u00ed*, thus helping to secure a 5\u20130 home victory for *Blaugrana* over local rivals.[226] Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Bar\u00e7a defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3\u20130 at home in the UEFA Champions League.[227] On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6\u20131 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga.[228] Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Bar\u00e7a defeat Las Palmas 3\u20130 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n185. **^** Rice, Simon (7 December 2015). \"Lionel Messi, Manchester United and Arsenal: The 10 Most Tweeted Sporting Moments of 2015\". *The Independent*.

A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2\u20130 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which \u2013 a slaloming dribble past three Real players \u2013 was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[108] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[109][110] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Bar\u00e7a's 3\u20131 victory.[111][112] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4\u20130 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2\u20130, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of \u20ac250\u00a0million, while his salary increased to \u20ac12\u00a0million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2003\u201304 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[31] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the *Juveniles* B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the *Juveniles A*, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[32][33] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal.

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1990: S\u00e1nchez\n* 1991: Butrague\u00f1o\n* 1992: Manolo\n* 1993: Bebeto\n* 1994: Rom\u00e1rio\n* 1995: Zamorano\n* 1996: Pizzi\n* 1997: Ronaldo\n* 1998: Vieri\n* 1999: Ra\u00fal\n* 2000: Salva\n* 2001: Ra\u00fal\n* 2002: Trist\u00e1n\n* 2003: Makaay\n* 2004: Ronaldo\n* 2005: Eto'o & Forl\u00e1n\n* 2006: Eto'o\n* 2007: Van Nistelrooy\n* 2008: G\u00fciza\n* 2009: Forl\u00e1n\n* 2010: Messi\n* 2011: C.

Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times.

During the *Cl\u00e1sico* on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Thompson, Wright (22 October 2012). \"Here and Gone: The Strange Relationship between Lionel Messi and His Hometown in Argentina\". *ESPN*.

by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[148] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3\u20131 home victory over Olympiacos.[230] Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart.[231] On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2\u20131 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.[232] Following the reception of his fourth Golden Boot, Messi signed a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November, keeping him with the club through the 2020\u201321 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2\u20130 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[376] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[377] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[378] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1\u20130 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[379] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[380]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004\u20132005: success at youth level[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIFFHS World's Best Player\n |\n| --- |\n| **Men's winners**\n* 1988: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1989: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1990: ![West Germany](image) Matth\u00e4us\n* 1991\u20132019: not awarded\n* 2020: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2021: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2022: ![Argentina](image) Messi\n* 2023: ![Norway](image) Haaland\n |\n| **Women's winners**\n- 2020: ![Denmark](image) Harder\n\n- 2021: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2022: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2023: ![Spain](image) Bonmat\u00ed\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bar\u00e7a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[19][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak\u00e1 and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak\u00e1.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007\u201308 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** Jenson, Pete (24 March 2014). \"Real Madrid 3 Barcelona 4 Match Report: Lionel Messi Hat-Trick Out-Guns Cristiano Ronaldo in Seven-Goal El Cl\u00e1sico Thriller\". *The Independent*.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pel\u00e9 as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[508] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3\u20130 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[509] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5\u20130 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s among the all-time international men's top scorers.[510]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of \u20ac7.8\u00a0million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66\u00a0yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[19][69] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[70] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[71][72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n644. **^** \"Lionel Messi's wife explains her absence at World Cup opener that left him broken hearted\". *USAHint*. 21 June 2018.

He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice.

In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6\u20130 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[391] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0\u20130 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[392][393] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1\u20131. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n623. **^** Henry, Thierry (21 April 2011). \"The 2011 Time 100: Lionel Messi, God of the Field\". *Time*.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent *La Albiceleste* since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\u20130 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n370. **^** \"Inter Miami CF Signs Seven-Time Ballon d'Or Winner, World Cup Champion, Lionel Messi | Inter Miami CF\". *Inter Miami CF*. 15 July 2023.

During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of '87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[16][17] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[538][539]\n\n\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[540] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[541][542][543] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[532][544] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[545] the most among active players.[546] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[547]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[404] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[405] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2\u20131 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1\u20130 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2\u20131 win in extra time. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n320. **^** Thomas, Lyall; Solhekol, Kaveh (8 August 2021). \"Lionel Messi 'shocked' and 'surprised' at Barcelona contract collapse\". *Sky Sports*.

He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2\u20130 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[529] In the following match against Cura\u00e7ao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7\u20130 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.[530]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n364. **^** Balague, Guillem (7 June 2023). \"Lionel Messi to join Inter Miami after leaving Paris St-Germain\". *BBC Sport*.

He ended the season with the highest number of assists in the league with 16 and was also included in the UNFP's Ligue 1 Team of the Season alongside teammates Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Mbapp\u00e9.[362][363]\n\n\n\n### Inter Miami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Messi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup\nFollowing confirmation of his departure from PSG, Messi was linked with a return to former club Barcelona, as well as with a big-money move to Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal, but his eventual decision to sign for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami was communicated to Barcelona president Joan Laporta by 5 June 2023.[364][365] Barcelona were unable to sign him due to financial constraints.[366]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7\u20130 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[151] These matches gave credence to the notion of *Messidependencia*, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[151]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[16] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against *La Raz\u00f3n* newspaper and was awarded \u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[668] Messi made a donation worth \u20ac1\u00a0million ($1.1\u00a0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[669] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[670] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[671]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTowards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the *Juveniles* B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[32][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his debut for the club on 21 July in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a 2\u20131 victory.[374] After scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi opened the scoring in the 2023 Leagues Cup final against Nashville SC on 19 August before Nashville equalised in the second half. The game ended in a penalty shoot-out which Miami won, 10\u20139, with Messi scoring the first, giving the club their first ever trophy.[375]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[655] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The Best FIFA Men's Player | * 2016: ![Portugal](image) C.

At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 32 | 16 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 1[h] | 1 | 41 | 21\n |\n| Total\n | 58 | 22 | 2 | 0 | 14 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 75 | 32\n |\n| Inter Miami | 2023 | MLS | 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 7[i] | 10 | 14 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 615 | 508 | 83 | 56 | 163 | 129 | 37 | 33 | 899 | 726\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[672][673] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \u00a3125,000.[674]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[317] with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[318] On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day.[319] The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[320] Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi's exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\".[321] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[322]\n\n\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain[edit]\n\n\n#### 2021\u201322: first season adjustments and seventh Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He played as a forward for Ferencv\u00e1ros, Slovan Bratislava, Barcelona, and Espanyol, among other clubs. Regarded as one of the best players in history, Kubala is considered a hero of FC Barcelona.[2] A Hungarian national by birth, he also held Czechoslovak and Spanish citizenship, and played for the national teams of all three countries.[3][4][5]\n\n\nKubala was noted for his quick and skilful dribbling, composed and powerful finishing, and accuracy from free kicks. During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\nKubala was born in Budapest, as were his parents, who came from mixed backgrounds. His mother, Anna Stecz, a factory worker, had Polish, Slovak and Hungarian roots, while his father, P\u00e1l Kubala Kurjas, a bricklayer, belonged to the Slovak minority of Hungary. Kubala described himself as a \"cosmopolitan\". He began his career as a junior player with Ganz TE, a factory team that played in the Hungarian third division. At the age of 11, he was playing in teams with other players who were three to five years older.[8] At the age of 18, he signed for Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC where he was a teammate of S\u00e1ndor Kocsis. In 1946, Kubala moved to Czechoslovakia, allegedly to avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined \u0160K Slovan Bratislava. In 1947, he married Anna Viola Dau\u010d\u00edkova, the sister of the Czechoslovakian national coach, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk. In 1948, Kubala returned to Hungary, again to allegedly avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined Vasas SC.\n\n\n\n### Refugee[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1949, as Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a communist satellite state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck. Initially, he arrived in the United States zone of Allied-occupied Austria and then moved on to Italy, where he played briefly for Pro Patria. In May 1949, he also agreed to play for Torino in a testimonial against S.L. Benfica but pulled out after his son became ill. On the way back from Lisbon, the plane carrying the Torino team crashed into the Superga hills, killing all 31 people on board.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian Football Federation accused Kubala of breach of contract, leaving the country without permission, and failure to do military service. FIFA backed them and imposed a one-year international ban. In January 1950, Kubala, with Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk as coach, formed his own team, *Hungaria*, which was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. In the summer of 1950, the team arrived in Spain to play a series of friendlies against a Madrid XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espanyol. They also played a friendly game against the legendary Millonarios FC lead by Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[9][10]\n\n\nDuring these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Jos\u00e9 Samitier, then chief scout at FC Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was persuaded by Samitier to sign for Barcelona. Samitier used his connections within the government of Francisco Franco to help arrange the transfer. Franco's government wanted to utilize Kubala's status as a refugee from one of the USSR's satellite countries to reinforce the regime's validity, thus helping Kubala obtain Spanish citizenship without delay.[11] In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used as propaganda by Franco's government and was made into a successful film, *The Stars Search for Peace*, which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nKubala signed for FC Barcelona on 15 June 1950, and as part of the deal, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk also became the Barcelona coach. However, the ban imposed on Kubala was still in place and he did not make his La Liga debut until 1951. He was permitted to play friendlies, and in two consecutive games against Frankfurter S.V., which FC Barcelona won 4\u20131 and 10\u20134, he scored six goals and assisted another five. He also played in the Copa del General\u00edsimo and helped the club win the trophy in 1951.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kubala (center) with special guests Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (left) and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s in a match held in his honour in 1961\nIn his first La Liga season, 1951\u201352, Kubala scored 26 goals in 19 games. This included 7 goals in a 9\u20130 win over Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, five against Celta de Vigo and hat-tricks against Sevilla and Racing de Santander. His seven goals against Gij\u00f3n remain the record for most goals scored in a single match in La Liga. He also scored in the Copa del General\u00edsimo final as Barcelona beat Valencia 4\u20132. This season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Coach Dau\u010d\u00edk and Kubala, together with players like Emilio Aldecoa, Velasco, Joan Segarra and Ramallets, inspired the team to win five trophies, including La Liga, the Copa del General\u00edsimo, the Latin Cup, and the Copa Eva Duarte. Kubala missed much of the 1952\u201353 season after contracting tuberculosis, which threatened to end his playing career. However, he made a miraculous recovery and returned to help Barcelona retain both La Liga and the Copa del General\u00edsimo. He also scored again in the Copa final win, a 2\u20131 win over Athletic Bilbao. During his time with Barcelona, he scored a total of 14 hat-tricks.\n\n\nIn 1958, Kubala persuaded two fellow Hungarian refugees S\u00e1ndor Kocsis and Zolt\u00e1n Czibor to join him at Barcelona. Together with a young Luis Su\u00e1rez and Evaristo, they formed the nucleus of the team that won a La Liga / Copa del General\u00edsimo double in 1959 and a La Liga / Fairs Cup double in 1960. However, Kubala found himself out of favour with coach Helenio Herrera and lost his place in the team. As a result, he missed the 1960 European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid which Barcelona lost 6\u20132 on aggregate. The result saw Herrera lose his job and Kubala restored to the team. In the 1961 European Cup, Barcelona became the first club to beat Real Madrid in the competition. Inspired by Kubala they won 4\u20133 on aggregate and subsequently reached the final where they lost to Benfica 2\u20133. Kubala briefly retired as a player in 1961 and initially became a youth coach at Barcelona, before becoming coach of the senior team for the 1962\u201363 season. However, after losing a Fairs Cup game to Red Star Belgrade, he was dismissed. In the summer of 1963, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.[14]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Kubala in the grounds of the Camp Nou\nKubala played for three international teams \u2013 Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain. While playing with \u0160K Slovan Bratislava, he appeared in six games and scored four goals for Czechoslovakia between 1946 and 1947. After returning to Budapest in 1948, he played three games for Hungary but failed to score. After adopting Spanish nationality, Kubala played 19 times and scored 11 goals for Spain between 1953 and 1961, being one of a small group to have played for the country having been born elsewhere. The highlight of his international career was a hat-trick for Spain against Turkey in 3\u20130 win in November 1957.[15][16] Despite playing for three countries, Kubala never played in the finals of a major international tournament. He was included in the Spain squad for the 1962 World Cup but, along with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, did not play due to injury.\n\n\nAs well as playing for three international teams, Kubala also played for both a Europe XI and the Catalan XI. On 21 October 1953, England played a Europe XI at Wembley Stadium to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Football Association and Kubala scored twice in the 4\u20134 draw. He also played four games and scored four times for the Catalan XI. On 26 January 1955, in a game against Bologna at Les Corts, he was joined by guest player Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano; the Catalan XI won 6\u20132 with two goals from Kubala and one from Di St\u00e9fano. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 4 March 1993 at the Montju\u00efc Stadium against an International XI. He played the opening ten minutes of the game at age 65.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Kubala accepted a contract as a player-coach with RCD Espanyol and teamed up with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. During his time at Espanyol he gave a La Liga debut to his son, Branko. In 1966, he joined FC Z\u00fcrich, again as player-coach, and made his last appearance in a European Cup game against the competition's eventual winners, Celtic. In 1967, Kubala went to Canada, where at Toronto Falcons he enjoyed something of family reunion with his father-in-law, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk, his brother-in-law, Yanko Daucik and his son Branko. He appeared in 19 matches for Toronto, scoring five times.[17]\n\n\nBy the end of 1968, he had returned to La Liga, and after a brief spell at C\u00f3rdoba CF, he became coach of the Spain national team. Kubala ended the team's 11-year absence from the World Cup when he guided the team to the 1978 World Cup, but could not steer them through the first-round group stage. He also managed them at Euro 80, where they were again eliminated in the first round.\n\n\nIn 1980, he returned to Barcelona as a manager for a second short spell before moving to Saudi Arabia where he managed Al-Hilal. He subsequently managed three other La Liga clubs, including CD M\u00e1laga whom he guided to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n title in 1988.

Nicknamed \"***El Pistolero\"*** ('The Gunman'), Su\u00e1rez is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest strikers of all time.[2] He has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot and a Pichichi Trophy, and has scored over 500 career goals for club and country.[3]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Su\u00e1rez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth \u00a364.98 million (\u20ac82.3 million adjusted for inflation), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.\n\n\nDubbed *MSN*, Su\u00e1rez was part of a dominant trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, winning the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in his first season. In his second season, he won the Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[4] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.[5][6] With Barcelona, Su\u00e1rez won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2020, winning his fifth La Liga title in his second season.[7]\n\n\nAt international level, Su\u00e1rez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, and formerly held the title of highest scorer in CONMEBOL FIFA World Cup qualifiers before being surpassed by former teammate Lionel Messi.[8] He has represented his nation at four editions of the FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named in the 2010 World Cup All-Star Team and won the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was awarded Best Player. Outside of his football credentials, Su\u00e1rez has been a source of controversy throughout his career,[note 1] including a goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, biting opponents on three occasions,[note 2] accusations of diving,[16][17] and racial incidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Youth[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"As I was growing up, there was only one player I looked up to, and that was Batistuta, the Argentina No.9.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Su\u00e1rez on his childhood idol, Gabriel Batistuta.[18]\n\nSu\u00e1rez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo Artigas.[19] At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he played youth football at Urreta.[20] When he was a child, a car ran over his foot, breaking the fifth metatarsal bone. In spite of the injury, he continued to play.[21]\n\n\n\n### Nacional[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez joined local side Nac's youth team at age 14.[22] At age 16, Su\u00e1rez headbutted a referee after showing his discontent following a red card, although a sports editor claimed he \"accidentally fell into the referee\".[23] One night, he was caught drinking and partying, prompting his coach to threaten he would never play unless he started playing football more seriously.[22] In May 2005, at age 18, Su\u00e1rez made his first-team debut against Atl\u00e9tico Junior in the Copa Libertadores.[22] He scored his first goal in September 2005[24] and helped Nacional win the 2005\u201306 Uruguayan league with 10 goals in 27 matches.[25]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club Groningen when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a \"wonder goal\" against Defensor. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Su\u00e1rez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional \u20ac800,000 for him.[22] Su\u00e1rez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sof\u00eda Balbi, had moved to Barcelona; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Groningen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez on the training field of Groningen in 2006\nSu\u00e1rez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Su\u00e1rez struggled because he could not speak Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game.[26] His teammate and fellow Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, and his teammate R\u00f9fson, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team.[26] He worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language.[26] Su\u00e1rez scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007, he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card.[27] Su\u00e1rez especially made his mark in a 4\u20133 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two goals.[28] Su\u00e1rez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances[29] to help Groningen finish eighth in the 2006\u201307 Eredivisie.[26] He also scored in a 4\u20132 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut on 14 September 2006.[26][30]\n\n\nAjax saw potential in Su\u00e1rez and offered Groningen \u20ac3.5\u00a0million for him, but Groningen rejected the offer.[31] Su\u00e1rez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale.[31] The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to \u20ac7.5\u00a0million and Groningen accepted.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Ajax[edit]\n\n\n#### 2007\u201309: Development and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 August 2007 Su\u00e1rez signed a five-year contract with Ajax, for a transfer fee of \u20ac7.5 million,[31][33] and made his club debut in the UEFA Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague.[34] He scored one goal in his Eredivisie debut for the club[35] and two goals in his home debut at the Amsterdam Arena.[36] Ajax finished second in the league table in the 2007\u201308 season[37] and Su\u00e1rez scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances, setting up a blossoming striking partnership with league top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.[38]\n\n\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Ajax head coach Marco van Basten noted how Su\u00e1rez played an important role in many of Ajax's goals, but Van Basten was also upset by the number of yellow cards Su\u00e1rez received.[35] Su\u00e1rez was suspended for one match[39] because he was given his seventh yellow card of the season against Utrecht in a 2\u20130 win.[40] He was also suspended after a half-time altercation with teammate Albert Luque over a free kick.[27][35] Ajax ended the season in third place.[41] Su\u00e1rez scored 22 goals in 31 league matches[35][38] and finished second in scoring tables, one goal behind Mounir El Hamdaoui of AZ.[42] Su\u00e1rez was also named Ajax Player of the Year.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: League top goal scorer, Eredivisie winner[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (with the Ajax pennant) as Ajax captain in 2010.

Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player by claiming \"it's not his job to own up\", while Mansfield manager Paul Cox said he felt \"a little bit gutted\" by the \"instinctive\" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.[92]\n\n\nOn 19 January, Su\u00e1rez scored his seventh goal in three matches against Norwich, as Liverpool cruised to a 5\u20130 home league victory.[93] The following week, Su\u00e1rez captained Liverpool for the first time for the FA Cup fourth round match against Oldham Athletic; Liverpool lost 2\u20133.[94] On 2 March, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic, leading Liverpool to a dominant 4\u20130 victory at the DW Stadium.

The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game \u2013 especially to young players\".[103]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2013, Su\u00e1rez said he would be seeking an exit from Liverpool in the summer, citing excessive media attention on his family as a reason for wanting to leave.[104] On 6 August, after Liverpool had rejected a bid of \u00a340,000,001 for the player from Arsenal, Su\u00e1rez reiterated his wish to leave Liverpool and said Liverpool had previously promised to allow him a transfer if the club failed to qualify for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League.[105] The following day, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool had not broken any promises to Su\u00e1rez and that the player had shown \"total disrespect\" for the club.[106] After this incident, the British press reported that Su\u00e1rez had been instructed to train away from the Liverpool first-team squad by Rodgers.[106][107][108] On 8 August, Liverpool owner John W.

He scored a curling free-kick from 30 yards (27\u00a0m) in a 2\u20131 defeat to Spain in their opening match at Recife on 16 June.[313] He then scored twice after appearing as a substitute in Uruguay's 8\u20130 win over Tahiti, making him the Uruguay national team's all-time top-goalscorer with 35 goals, surpassing his teammate Diego Forl\u00e1n.[314] Uruguay were eventually eliminated in the semi-finals, losing 2\u20131 to Brazil in Belo Horizonte.[315]\n\n\n\n### 2014 FIFA World Cup, third biting incident[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (middle) celebrating one of his two goals against England at the 2014 World Cup\nSu\u00e1rez ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the South American section with 11 goals in 14 matches.[316] In November 2013, Uruguay defeated Jordan 5\u20130 on aggregate in an intercontinental play-off to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.[317]\n\n\nOn 22 May, Su\u00e1rez underwent emergency surgery on his left knee. He was confined to a wheelchair for a time, leading to rumours he would be unable to participate in the World Cup.[318][319][320] He was named as a substitute for Uruguay's first match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Costa Rica, but did not play in the match. Su\u00e1rez started Uruguay's second match against England and scored both of the team's goals in a 2\u20131 win at the Arena Corinthians in S\u00e3o Paulo.[321]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"These are just things that happen out on the pitch. It was just the two of us inside the area and he bumped into me with his shoulder and that's how my eye got like this as well. There are things that happen on the pitch and you should not make such a big deal out of them.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Su\u00e1rez's post-match interview against Italy, 24 June 2014.[322]\n\n> \n> \"...

I hit my face against [Chiellini], leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Su\u00e1rez's defence to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, 25 June 2014.[323]\n\n> \n> \"... the truth is that my colleague Giorgio Chiellini suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me ... I apologize to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be another incident like [this].\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Su\u00e1rez on 30 June 2014.[324]\n\nFor Uruguay's final group match against Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the knockout stage while Italy only needed a draw.[325] Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0\u20130, Su\u00e1rez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Su\u00e1rez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Su\u00e1rez falling and clutching his face.[14][326] The controversial incident made headline news around the world.[327] As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez for not penalizing Su\u00e1rez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1\u20130 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.[14][326][328]\n\n\nTwo days later, on 26 June, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, banned Su\u00e1rez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup.[145][329] He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000.[145][329] The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Su\u00e1rez's defense that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was \"deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilizing him\". The severity of the penalty was due to the fact it was Su\u00e1rez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse.[323] Soon after the suspension was announced, online gambling firm 888poker cancelled its sponsorship deal with Su\u00e1rez.[330] With Su\u00e1rez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 0\u20132 to Colombia and were eliminated from the World Cup.[331]\n\n\nOn the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal the suspension.[332] Su\u00e1rez's lawyer said that \"we don't have any doubts\" of a European-based campaign against Su\u00e1rez.[333] Various Uruguayan individuals defended Su\u00e1rez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticized the severity of his ban, including President of Uruguay Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who labelled the ban \"fascist\" and called FIFA \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\";[334][335] AUF president Wilmar Valdez;[332] Uruguay captain Diego Lugano;[336] and Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest of the ban.[337] The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood.[338] For non-Uruguayan parties, Chiellini, who was bitten, called the ban \"excessive\", while international players' union FIFPro called for Su\u00e1rez to \"receive all the support he needs\" and that the \"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\" of Su\u00e1rez.[337]\n\n\nSix days after the incident, on 30 June, Su\u00e1rez apologized to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini.[324][339] Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Su\u00e1rez's suspension.[339][340]\n\n\nOn 3 July, the AUF appealed Su\u00e1rez's ban,[341] but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July.[342][343] With Su\u00e1rez's ban not preventing him from transferring to another club,[344] it was announced on 11 July that Su\u00e1rez had agreed to move to Barcelona.[345][346][347] Days before the transfer, Su\u00e1rez's apology to Chiellini had been praised by various Barcelona club individuals. Barcelona club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \"honorable\", sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Su\u00e1rez as being \"humble enough to admit an error\" while new signing Ivan Rakiti\u0107 commended Su\u00e1rez's \"character and strength\".[348][349]\n\n\n\n### Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario and 2018 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez playing against Portugal in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup\nOn 25 March 2016, after over a year of international absence for Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer against Brazil in Recife for a 2\u20132 draw in the qualification process for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[350] Su\u00e1rez was included in Uruguay's 23-man squad for the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, although a hamstring injury sustained in the Copa del Rey final on 22 May put his place in the team in jeopardy.[180][179] Although he remained in the squad, he missed both of his national side's opening group losses to Mexico and Venezuela, which resulted in a first-round elimination from the tournament.[351] He was once again left on the substitutes' bench in Uruguay's final 3\u20130 group win over Jamaica on 13 June.[352]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez scored twice on 10 October 2017 as Uruguay won 4\u20132 at home to Bolivia in their final World Cup qualifying match, thus securing their place for the tournament in Russia, as well as becoming the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Argentina's Lionel Messi, overtaking the previous record which was held by Hern\u00e1n Crespo.[353][354] In March, Uruguay won the 2018 China Cup, and Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th international goal with a penalty against the Czech Republic in the semi-finals, winning it himself when fouled by goalkeeper Ji\u0159\u00ed Pavlenka.[355] He won his 100th cap on 20 June 2018 in Uruguay's second group match at the World Cup, scoring the only goal against Saudi Arabia at the Rostov Arena in Rostov-on-Don to advance the nation into the last 16, for which Su\u00e1rez was given man of the match.[356] In the final group game on 25 June, Su\u00e1rez was again named the man of the match as he scored Uruguay's opener with a free kick into the bottom corner in a 3\u20130 win over hosts Russia.[357] In the Round of 16 match against Portugal on 30 June, he set-up Cavani's opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 victory.[358] Uruguay were eliminated from the tournament following a 2\u20130 defeat to France in the quarter-finals on 6 July.[359]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u20132020: Qualifiers and Copa Am\u00e9rica upset[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, manager Tab\u00e1rez included Su\u00e1rez in the final 23-man Uruguay squad for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[360] On 16 June, he scored the third goal in a 4\u20130 win over Ecuador in the team's opening group match of the tournament, also setting up the opener scored by Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro.[361]\n\n\nIn the quarter-finals against Peru on 29 June, he had a goal disallowed by VAR for offside, and was subsequently the only player to miss his spot-kick in the resulting penalty shoot-out, following a 0\u20130 draw after regulation time, which saw Uruguay eliminated from the competition.[362]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2020, Su\u00e1rez scored the first goal of the South American 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, becoming the first player ever to score the opening goal three times (after his 2010 and 2014 strikes) in the competition's history.[363]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present: Copa Am\u00e9rica and 2022 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 June 2021, Su\u00e1rez scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Chile in Uruguay's second group match of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[364] However, Uruguay lost against Colombia in the quarter-finals on penalties after a goalless draw.[365]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2022, in Uruguay's final group match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar against Ghana, Su\u00e1rez assisted Giorgian de Arrascaeta's second goal of the match to give Uruguay a 2\u20130 win; however, group rivals South Korea scored a late goal to win 2\u20131 against Portugal, advancing from the group stage having scored four goals to Uruguay\u2019s two (both teams were tied at 4 points and a 0 goal difference).[366]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez in action for Liverpool takes on Sylvain Distin of Everton during the Merseyside Derby in 2012\nSu\u00e1rez creates goal scoring chances with his powerful shot, and has \"remarkable technical ability\" according to his FIFA profile.[367] Known for his direct running at players, Su\u00e1rez has a particular penchant for nutmegging opponents (putting the ball through their legs).[368] Liverpool fans (accompanied with a banner) used to say he was so good, \"he could nutmeg a mermaid\".[369] Often regarded by many as one of the best strikers of all time,[note 3] Su\u00e1rez is a prolific goal scorer, having the rare distinction of being the leading scorer in three top-flight European leagues, a feat only matched by Ruud van Nistelrooy[376] and Cristiano Ronaldo.[377] An accurate finisher[378] with either foot,[379] despite being naturally right-footed,[380] he is capable of scoring from both inside[381] and outside the penalty area.[382]\n\n\nHarry Redknapp said that Su\u00e1rez could play anywhere \u2013 as the target man or behind as a second striker. Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez called Su\u00e1rez \"a great forward, an elite player among forwards in the world\",[383] and Liverpool coach Kenny Dalglish said, \"he's intelligent, he's had a fantastic education at Ajax\".[384] Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said his abilities allow him to get into a position to score and evade defenders.[385][386] Meanwhile, Thierry Henry called Su\u00e1rez the best striker in the world, stating, \"He has everything. He's in your face, he's arrogant- in a good way, he can volley it, he can score headers. He has vicious side to his game and I will not call it cheating. He knows how to score goals.\"[387]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been praised for his work rate,[385] movement,[388] and his quickness[384] that allows him to attack from the outside;[367] as such he occasionally played as an inverted winger on the left flank during his time with Ajax.[389] Additionally, Su\u00e1rez has a liking for often executing dummies (going around the defenders with a fake-out) within his style of dribbling.[390] During his time in Barcelona, he was known for constantly scoring through volleys or half-volleys.[391][392] Su\u00e1rez also gained a reputation for consistently scoring acrobatic goals, often shooting off balance, or in air, or with overhead bicycle kicks.[393][394][395] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick taker,[396] and has also been known to take penalties.[397]\n\n\nHe also creates many scoring opportunities for his teammates with his vision and great passing abilities, as is reflected in his numbers of assists, among the very highest within the stat's recorded history.[398] Former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, lauded Su\u00e1rez's unselfish playstyle within his autobiography, stating how that \"It's a rare combination, to be a miraculous footballer who is willing to use his gifts to selflessly assist and create goals for a teammate\", as well as further writing, \"He scores goals. He creates goals. He's hard and horrible to play against. You've got a chance of beating anyone in the world with Luis Su\u00e1rez in your team\".[399][400]\n\n\nIn addition to being a prolific player, Su\u00e1rez has often been praised for his strong mentality and desire to win. Former Liverpool teammate, Jordan Henderson dubbed Su\u00e1rez as a \"warrior\", claiming that his attitude inspired confidence among his teammates.[401] Meanwhile, Gerrard eulogized his drive to succeed, stating \"Luis played to win a five-a-side training session like he was chasing the Champions League or the World Cup. If his team lost a kickaround he went home angry; he always needed to win that badly\".[400] Atletico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone hailed Su\u00e1rez for the \"desire and energy\" he brought to the club.[402] Su\u00e1rez, himself, has stated that he's the kind of player who would \"kill himself just to prevent a throw-in at the 90th minute.\" in his autobiography.[403]\n\n\nFormer Ajax coach Marco van Basten criticized Su\u00e1rez for his tendency to receive yellow cards.[35] Van Basten said he had a tense relationship with Su\u00e1rez,[35] although he conceded that \"Luis is unpredictable, he's hard to influence but that makes him special.\"[35] At times, Su\u00e1rez can be dominant but fail to convert his efforts into goals.[404] Despite his weaknesses, Su\u00e1rez's leadership stood out to Ajax management.[60]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been widely accused of diving.[note 4] His manager, teammates and various analysts have commented that this reputation for simulation has caused referees not to award him legitimate penalties.[408][409] In January 2013, Su\u00e1rez admitted to diving against Stoke City in an October 2012 match. This led his manager Brendan Rodgers to comment his actions were \"unacceptable\" and that he would be dealt with \"internally\" by the club.[410] During the 2018 World Cup game against Portugal, after collisions with Portuguese players, Suarez twice acted like he had a head injury despite his head having been untouched.[411]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez is infamous for biting opponents on multiple occasions. In a Group D matchup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Suarez was shown to have bitten Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, resulting in FIFA suspending Suarez from all football activities for 4 months. While playing for Liverpool, Suarez bit Chelsea player Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 in a Premier League match, and was punished with a ten match ban. In an earlier incident while playing for AFC Ajax he was caught biting PSV Eindhoven player Otman Bakkal and was suspended for seven games.[100] Su\u00e1rez has also been accused of stamping on opponents in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League.[412][413][414][415]\n\n\nDue to his diving, biting, stamping, and other antics, Su\u00e1rez has been frequently labelled as a pest and a cheat.[416] In December 2013, Spanish football website *El Gol Digital* ranked Su\u00e1rez at fifth in its list of the world's dirtiest footballers.[417]\n\n\n\n## Media and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Previously with Adidas, Su\u00e1rez has been sponsored by Puma since 2018. He wears Puma Future 2.1.\nSu\u00e1rez had a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas, before switching to rivals Puma in 2018.[418] Su\u00e1rez starred in a 2014 advert for Beats with other global football stars including Neymar and Thierry Henry, with the theme of \"The Game Before the Game\" and the players' pre-game ritual of listening to music.[419] In Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez has also appeared in advertisements for Abitab, Antel, Cablevisi\u00f3n, Garnier, Pepsi and Samsung.[420][421]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez features in EA Sports' *FIFA* video game series: as a result of Su\u00e1rez's ban for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup, players in *FIFA 15* were unable to select Su\u00e1rez until his ban ended on 26 October.[422]\n\n\nActive on social media, Su\u00e1rez has over 40 million Instagram followers as of May 2020, the most for a person from Uruguay.[423][424]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was born in Salto, Uruguay to Sandra Diaz and Rodolfo Su\u00e1rez, the fourth of seven boys.[27][425] His older brother, Paolo Su\u00e1rez, is a retired professional footballer, who last played for Isidro Metap\u00e1n in El Salvador.\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez moved with his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.[425] In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,[24][425] while also taking up work as a street sweeper at the age of 15.[23] In 1998, aged 11 he appeared as a contestant on children's game show *Aventujuegos*, with his team winning: his episode was brought up in a 2011 episode of chat show *Noche de Locura* and he was surprised the footage had been kept.[3]\n\n\nThe contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.[23] Besides his native tongue, Su\u00e1rez is able to speak Dutch and English.[426][427]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mural of Su\u00e1rez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay\nSu\u00e1rez is of mixed race and has a black grandfather.[428] The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the Patrice Evra incident, where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of \"*mi negrito*\" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Su\u00e1rez's repeated use of \"negro\" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable, issuing him an eight-match ban. His mother also supported the claim Su\u00e1rez made that using the word was not racist in Uruguay. She said it was \"normal\", and that it was \"a word people use with their friends. It's like calling someone fat, thin or whatever.\"[429]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began dating Sof\u00eda Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to Barcelona in 2003, and Su\u00e1rez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sof\u00eda again.[23] Su\u00e1rez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter named Delfina (born 2010) [430]and two sons named Benjamin (born 2013) and Lauti (born 2018).[431][27][432] He has a tattoo of his daughter's name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his goal celebration \u2013 this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports\u2019 video game *FIFA 15* as \"Kiss The Wrist\".[433][434] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer to Sof\u00eda's family. On the move, Su\u00e1rez said, \"[Liverpool] did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right.\"[435] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez released his autobiography, *Crossing the Line \u2013 My Story*.[436][437]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez, who is married to an Italian citizen, was eligible to take a B1 Italian Language exam and flew to Perugia in September 2020 to take the test and gain Italian citizenship. Though obtaining the results of the language exam and approval of citizenship takes several months and several years respectively to be processed, Su\u00e1rez reportedly got his language exam results within hours and would have his citizenship approved in several weeks. The Italian media had noted that this led to accusations of special treatment against Su\u00e1rez, especially as Italian laws had been changed in 2018 to make obtaining citizenship by marriage more difficult.[438] In September 2020, an investigation was launched over accusations that he had cheated his way into gaining Italian citizenship.[234]\n\n\nIt is known that Su\u00e1rez has used his experience and knowledge to mentor new Uruguayan footballing talents, most notably Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.[439]\n\n\n\n### Pandora Papers[edit]\n\n\nHe is among the 13 sports personalities mentioned

He later coached Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 187 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Su\u00e1rez, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, C\u00e9sar, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the *midfield general* role and was nicknamed *Surrealista* (*The Surrealist*) and *Home Magosta* (*The Grasshopper Man*)[3] due to his style.\n\n\nAs a manager, he led Barcelona to a title in La Liga in 1945, and as a scout he recruited another Barcelona legend, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala. However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di St\u00e9fano affair,[3] twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco,[3] Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona.[*citation needed*] When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Samitier played as a junior for FC Internacional before, at the age of 17, he made his debut for FC Barcelona in 1919. As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqu\u00e9s, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dal\u00ed. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928.\n\n\n\n### Madrid CF[edit]\n\n\nIn 1933 an aging Samiter found himself in dispute with the FC Barcelona management and he was dropped from the first team. Real Madrid, then known as *Madrid CF*, were quick to take advantage of the situation. Samitier was reunited with both his friend Ricardo Zamora and then Francisco Bru. Although his career with the Madrid club was short, he did help them win a title in La Liga 1932\u201333 and the Copa de Espa\u00f1a in 1934.\n\n\n\n### Samitier Tribute[edit]\n\n\nThe tribute match to Samitier was held on 13 May 1934 at Estadio Chamart\u00edn in Madrid, between Madrid FC and Espanyol, and Samitier scored both the first and the last goals of an 8\u20132 win. Other Madrid goalscorers include the likes of Eugenio, Hilario, Luis Regueiro and Lazcano, while Jos\u00e9 Padr\u00f3n scored one of Espanyol's consolation goals.\n\n\n**Madrid**: Zamora (Cayol 45\u00b4); Quesada, Maci\u00e1, P. Regueiro (Sauto), Bonet, Gurruchaga, (Valle 45\u00b4), Lazcano, L. Regueiro (Olivares 45\u00b4) Samitier, Hilario and Eugenio.\n\n\n**Espanyol**: Martorell (Eizaguirre 45\u00b4); Mas, P\u00e9rez, Cifuentes, Sol\u00e9 (Antero 45\u00b4), Cristi\u00e0, Prats, Edelmiro, Iriondo, Padr\u00f3n and Bosch.\n\n\n\n### Exile in France[edit]\n\n\nIn 1936 Samitier made a brief start to his career as a coach. He succeeded Fred Pentland at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the middle of the season, but failed to prevent them from being relegated. However, Samitier's new career and Atl\u00e9tico's relegation were postponed with the start of the Spanish Civil War. He found himself arrested by an anarchist militia, but was eventually released and left for France on a warship. His *escape* was later used by the Nationalist side in an account printed in *Marca*. In October 1936 he joined OGC Nice as a player, where he was reunited once again with Ricardo Zamora. He subsequently scored 21 goals in 48 matches for the French team.[5] He eventually retired as a player in 1939 and was briefly coach at OGC Nice in 1942.\n\n\n\n### Return to Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nSamitier returned to Spain and became manager of CF Barcelona in 1944. In 1945 he guided them to only their second ever La Liga title. Then they beat the Copa del General\u00edsimo winners Atl\u00e9tico Bilbao to win the Copa de Oro Argentina. Samitier subsequently worked as the clubs *chief scout* and was instrumental in the recruitment of another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1950 Kubala arrived in Spain with his own team, *Hungaria*. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. They played a series of friendlies against a *Madrid Select XI*, a Spain XI and RCD Espa\u00f1ol. During these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Samitier. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was then persuaded by Samitier to sign for CF Barcelona. It has been suggested that Samitier used his connections within Francoist Spain to help arrange the transfer. In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used by Francoist Spain and was made into a film *The Stars Search for Peace* which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1920, together with Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga, Pichichi and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Belauste, Samitier was a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games.[6] He subsequently made 21 appearances and scored 2 goals for Spain.[1]\n\n\nSamitier also played 26 games and scored at least 20 goals for the Catalan XI.[*citation needed*] However, records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played and scored more. Together with Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Sagibarba and Zamora, he helped the Catalan XI win the Prince of Asturias Cup twice in the 1920s, winning the inter-regional competition in 1923\u201324 and 1926. In the 1924 final, he scored twice in a 4\u20134 draw against Castile/Madrid XI and scored again in the replay as the Catalan team won 3\u20132.[7] Catalonia faced Czechoslovakia twice in 1925 and 1926, and Samitier managed to score in both games, a 2\u20131 win and a 2\u20131 defeat, respecteviely.[8][9] His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 19 January 1936 at the *Les Corts*.

Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la m\u00e1scara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017\u201318 league campaign, against Espanyol in *Derbi barcelon\u00ed*, thus helping to secure a 5\u20130 home victory for *Blaugrana* over local rivals.[226] Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Bar\u00e7a defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3\u20130 at home in the UEFA Champions League.[227] On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6\u20131 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga.[228] Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Bar\u00e7a defeat Las Palmas 3\u20130 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n185. **^** Rice, Simon (7 December 2015). \"Lionel Messi, Manchester United and Arsenal: The 10 Most Tweeted Sporting Moments of 2015\". *The Independent*.

A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2\u20130 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which \u2013 a slaloming dribble past three Real players \u2013 was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[108] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[109][110] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Bar\u00e7a's 3\u20131 victory.[111][112] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4\u20130 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2\u20130, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of \u20ac250\u00a0million, while his salary increased to \u20ac12\u00a0million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2003\u201304 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[31] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the *Juveniles* B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the *Juveniles A*, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[32][33] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous.

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice.

debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[37] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[44][45] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys in Montju\u00efc, coming on in the 82nd

by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[148] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3\u20131 home victory over Olympiacos.[230] Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart.[231] On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2\u20131 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.[232] Following the reception of his fourth Golden Boot, Messi signed a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November, keeping him with the club through the 2020\u201321 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2\u20130 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[376] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[377] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[378] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1\u20130 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[379] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[380]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004\u20132005: success at youth level[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIFFHS World's Best Player\n |\n| --- |\n| **Men's winners**\n* 1988: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1989: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1990: ![West Germany](image) Matth\u00e4us\n* 1991\u20132019: not awarded\n* 2020: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2021: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2022: ![Argentina](image) Messi\n* 2023: ![Norway](image) Haaland\n |\n| **Women's winners**\n- 2020: ![Denmark](image) Harder\n\n- 2021: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2022: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2023: ![Spain](image) Bonmat\u00ed\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bar\u00e7a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[19][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak\u00e1 and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak\u00e1.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007\u201308 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** Jenson, Pete (24 March 2014). \"Real Madrid 3 Barcelona 4 Match Report: Lionel Messi Hat-Trick Out-Guns Cristiano Ronaldo in Seven-Goal El Cl\u00e1sico Thriller\". *The Independent*.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pel\u00e9 as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[508] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3\u20130 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[509] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5\u20130 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s among the all-time international men's top scorers.[510]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of \u20ac7.8\u00a0million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66\u00a0yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[19][69] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[70] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[71][72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n644. **^** \"Lionel Messi's wife explains her absence at World Cup opener that left him broken hearted\". *USAHint*. 21 June 2018.

He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[662] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[663]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2008 UEFA Team of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK: Casillas\n* RB: Ramos\n* CB: Terry\n* CB: Puyol\n* LB: Lahm\n* MF: C.

Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice.

In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6\u20130 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[391] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0\u20130 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[392][393] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1\u20131. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n623. **^** Henry, Thierry (21 April 2011). \"The 2011 Time 100: Lionel Messi, God of the Field\". *Time*.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent *La Albiceleste* since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\u20130 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n370. **^** \"Inter Miami CF Signs Seven-Time Ballon d'Or Winner, World Cup Champion, Lionel Messi | Inter Miami CF\". *Inter Miami CF*. 15 July 2023.

During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of '87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[16][17] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[538][539]\n\n\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[540] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[541][542][543] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[532][544] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[545] the most among active players.[546] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[547]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[404] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[405] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2\u20131 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1\u20130 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2\u20131 win in extra time. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n320. **^** Thomas, Lyall; Solhekol, Kaveh (8 August 2021). \"Lionel Messi 'shocked' and 'surprised' at Barcelona contract collapse\". *Sky Sports*.

He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2\u20130 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[529] In the following match against Cura\u00e7ao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7\u20130 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.[530]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n364. **^** Balague, Guillem (7 June 2023). \"Lionel Messi to join Inter Miami after leaving Paris St-Germain\". *BBC Sport*.

He ended the season with the highest number of assists in the league with 16 and was also included in the UNFP's Ligue 1 Team of the Season alongside teammates Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Mbapp\u00e9.[362][363]\n\n\n\n### Inter Miami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Messi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup\nFollowing confirmation of his departure from PSG, Messi was linked with a return to former club Barcelona, as well as with a big-money move to Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal, but his eventual decision to sign for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami was communicated to Barcelona president Joan Laporta by 5 June 2023.[364][365] Barcelona were unable to sign him due to financial constraints.[366]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7\u20130 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[151] These matches gave credence to the notion of *Messidependencia*, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[151]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[16] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against *La Raz\u00f3n* newspaper and was awarded \u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[668] Messi made a donation worth \u20ac1\u00a0million ($1.1\u00a0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[669] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[670] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[671]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTowards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the *Juveniles* B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[32][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his debut for the club on 21 July in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a 2\u20131 victory.[374] After scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi opened the scoring in the 2023 Leagues Cup final against Nashville SC on 19 August before Nashville equalised in the second half. The game ended in a penalty shoot-out which Miami won, 10\u20139, with Messi scoring the first, giving the club their first ever trophy.[375]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[655] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The Best FIFA Men's Player | * 2016: ![Portugal](image) C.

At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 32 | 16 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 1[h] | 1 | 41 | 21\n |\n| Total\n | 58 | 22 | 2 | 0 | 14 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 75 | 32\n |\n| Inter Miami | 2023 | MLS | 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 7[i] | 10 | 14 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 615 | 508 | 83 | 56 | 163 | 129 | 37 | 33 | 899 | 726\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[672][673] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \u00a3125,000.[674]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[317] with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[318] On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day.[319] The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[320] Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi's exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\".[321] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[322]\n\n\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain[edit]\n\n\n#### 2021\u201322: first season adjustments and seventh Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He played as a forward for Ferencv\u00e1ros, Slovan Bratislava, Barcelona, and Espanyol, among other clubs. Regarded as one of the best players in history, Kubala is considered a hero of FC Barcelona.[2] A Hungarian national by birth, he also held Czechoslovak and Spanish citizenship, and played for the national teams of all three countries.[3][4][5]\n\n\nKubala was noted for his quick and skilful dribbling, composed and powerful finishing, and accuracy from free kicks. During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\nKubala was born in Budapest, as were his parents, who came from mixed backgrounds. His mother, Anna Stecz, a factory worker, had Polish, Slovak and Hungarian roots, while his father, P\u00e1l Kubala Kurjas, a bricklayer, belonged to the Slovak minority of Hungary. Kubala described himself as a \"cosmopolitan\". He began his career as a junior player with Ganz TE, a factory team that played in the Hungarian third division. At the age of 11, he was playing in teams with other players who were three to five years older.[8] At the age of 18, he signed for Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC where he was a teammate of S\u00e1ndor Kocsis. In 1946, Kubala moved to Czechoslovakia, allegedly to avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined \u0160K Slovan Bratislava. In 1947, he married Anna Viola Dau\u010d\u00edkova, the sister of the Czechoslovakian national coach, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk. In 1948, Kubala returned to Hungary, again to allegedly avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined Vasas SC.\n\n\n\n### Refugee[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1949, as Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a communist satellite state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck. Initially, he arrived in the United States zone of Allied-occupied Austria and then moved on to Italy, where he played briefly for Pro Patria. In May 1949, he also agreed to play for Torino in a testimonial against S.L. Benfica but pulled out after his son became ill. On the way back from Lisbon, the plane carrying the Torino team crashed into the Superga hills, killing all 31 people on board.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian Football Federation accused Kubala of breach of contract, leaving the country without permission, and failure to do military service. FIFA backed them and imposed a one-year international ban. In January 1950, Kubala, with Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk as coach, formed his own team, *Hungaria*, which was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. In the summer of 1950, the team arrived in Spain to play a series of friendlies against a Madrid XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espanyol. They also played a friendly game against the legendary Millonarios FC lead by Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[9][10]\n\n\nDuring these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Jos\u00e9 Samitier, then chief scout at FC Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was persuaded by Samitier to sign for Barcelona. Samitier used his connections within the government of Francisco Franco to help arrange the transfer. Franco's government wanted to utilize Kubala's status as a refugee from one of the USSR's satellite countries to reinforce the regime's validity, thus helping Kubala obtain Spanish citizenship without delay.[11] In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used as propaganda by Franco's government and was made into a successful film, *The Stars Search for Peace*, which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nKubala signed for FC Barcelona on 15 June 1950, and as part of the deal, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk also became the Barcelona coach. However, the ban imposed on Kubala was still in place and he did not make his La Liga debut until 1951. He was permitted to play friendlies, and in two consecutive games against Frankfurter S.V., which FC Barcelona won 4\u20131 and 10\u20134, he scored six goals and assisted another five. He also played in the Copa del General\u00edsimo and helped the club win the trophy in 1951.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kubala (center) with special guests Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (left) and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s in a match held in his honour in 1961\nIn his first La Liga season, 1951\u201352, Kubala scored 26 goals in 19 games. This included 7 goals in a 9\u20130 win over Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, five against Celta de Vigo and hat-tricks against Sevilla and Racing de Santander. His seven goals against Gij\u00f3n remain the record for most goals scored in a single match in La Liga. He also scored in the Copa del General\u00edsimo final as Barcelona beat Valencia 4\u20132. This season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Coach Dau\u010d\u00edk and Kubala, together with players like Emilio Aldecoa, Velasco, Joan Segarra and Ramallets, inspired the team to win five trophies, including La Liga, the Copa del General\u00edsimo, the Latin Cup, and the Copa Eva Duarte. Kubala missed much of the 1952\u201353 season after contracting tuberculosis, which threatened to end his playing career. However, he made a miraculous recovery and returned to help Barcelona retain both La Liga and the Copa del General\u00edsimo. He also scored again in the Copa final win, a 2\u20131 win over Athletic Bilbao. During his time with Barcelona, he scored a total of 14 hat-tricks.\n\n\nIn 1958, Kubala persuaded two fellow Hungarian refugees S\u00e1ndor Kocsis and Zolt\u00e1n Czibor to join him at Barcelona. Together with a young Luis Su\u00e1rez and Evaristo, they formed the nucleus of the team that won a La Liga / Copa del General\u00edsimo double in 1959 and a La Liga / Fairs Cup double in 1960. However, Kubala found himself out of favour with coach Helenio Herrera and lost his place in the team. As a result, he missed the 1960 European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid which Barcelona lost 6\u20132 on aggregate. The result saw Herrera lose his job and Kubala restored to the team. In the 1961 European Cup, Barcelona became the first club to beat Real Madrid in the competition. Inspired by Kubala they won 4\u20133 on aggregate and subsequently reached the final where they lost to Benfica 2\u20133. Kubala briefly retired as a player in 1961 and initially became a youth coach at Barcelona, before becoming coach of the senior team for the 1962\u201363 season. However, after losing a Fairs Cup game to Red Star Belgrade, he was dismissed. In the summer of 1963, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.[14]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Kubala in the grounds of the Camp Nou\nKubala played for three international teams \u2013 Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain. While playing with \u0160K Slovan Bratislava, he appeared in six games and scored four goals for Czechoslovakia between 1946 and 1947. After returning to Budapest in 1948, he played three games for Hungary but failed to score. After adopting Spanish nationality, Kubala played 19 times and scored 11 goals for Spain between 1953 and 1961, being one of a small group to have played for the country having been born elsewhere. The highlight of his international career was a hat-trick for Spain against Turkey in 3\u20130 win in November 1957.[15][16] Despite playing for three countries, Kubala never played in the finals of a major international tournament. He was included in the Spain squad for the 1962 World Cup but, along with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, did not play due to injury.\n\n\nAs well as playing for three international teams, Kubala also played for both a Europe XI and the Catalan XI. On 21 October 1953, England played a Europe XI at Wembley Stadium to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Football Association and Kubala scored twice in the 4\u20134 draw. He also played four games and scored four times for the Catalan XI. On 26 January 1955, in a game against Bologna at Les Corts, he was joined by guest player Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano; the Catalan XI won 6\u20132 with two goals from Kubala and one from Di St\u00e9fano. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 4 March 1993 at the Montju\u00efc Stadium against an International XI. He played the opening ten minutes of the game at age 65.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Kubala accepted a contract as a player-coach with RCD Espanyol and teamed up with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. During his time at Espanyol he gave a La Liga debut to his son, Branko. In 1966, he joined FC Z\u00fcrich, again as player-coach, and made his last appearance in a European Cup game against the competition's eventual winners, Celtic. In 1967, Kubala went to Canada, where at Toronto Falcons he enjoyed something of family reunion with his father-in-law, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk, his brother-in-law, Yanko Daucik and his son Branko. He appeared in 19 matches for Toronto, scoring five times.[17]\n\n\nBy the end of 1968, he had returned to La Liga, and after a brief spell at C\u00f3rdoba CF, he became coach of the Spain national team. Kubala ended the team's 11-year absence from the World Cup when he guided the team to the 1978 World Cup, but could not steer them through the first-round group stage. He also managed them at Euro 80, where they were again eliminated in the first round.\n\n\nIn 1980, he returned to Barcelona as a manager for a second short spell before moving to Saudi Arabia where he managed Al-Hilal. He subsequently managed three other La Liga clubs, including CD M\u00e1laga whom he guided to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n title in 1988. His last coaching position was with Paraguay in 1995.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\n| Club\n | Season\n | League\n | Cup\n | Continental\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals\n |\n| Ganz TE\n | 1943\u201344[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II | 9 | 2 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 2\n |\n| Ferencv\u00e1rosi | 1944[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1945[20] | 22 | 19 |  |  |  |  | 22 | 19\n |\n| 1945\u201346[20] | 27 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 27 | 14\n |\n| Total\n | 49 | 33 |  |  |  |  | 49 | 33\n |\n| Slovan Bratislava | 1946\u201347[20] | Czechoslovak First League | 24 | 13 |  |  |  |  | 24 | 13\n |\n| 1947\u201348[20] | 9 | 1 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 33 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 33 | 14\n |\n| Vasas | 1948\u201349[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I\n | 20 | 10 |  |  |  |  | 20 | 10\n |\n| 1949\u201350[20] | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 6\n |\n| Total\n | 32 | 16 |  |  |  |  | 32 | 16\n |\n| Pro Patria | 1949\u201350[20] | Serie A | 16 | 9 |  |  |  |  | 16 | 9\n |\n| Hung\u00e1ria\n | 1950\u201351[20] |  | 6 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 6 | 5\n |\n| Barcelona | 1951\u201352[20][21] | La Liga | 19 | 26 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 26\n |\n| 1952\u201353[20][21] | 11 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 11 | 7\n |\n| 1953\u201354[20][21] | 28 | 23 |  |  |  |  | 28 | 23\n |\n| 1954\u201355[20][21] | 19 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 14\n |\n| 1955\u201356[20][21] | 25 | 14 |  |  | 3[a] | 3 | 28 | 17\n |\n| 1956\u201357[21] | 18 | 9 | 1 | 0 |  |  | 19 | 9\n |\n| 1957\u201358[21] | 21 | 12 |  |  |  |  | 21 | 12\n |\n| 1958\u201359[20][21] | 20 | 9 |  |  | 5[a] | 3 | 25 | 12\n |\n| 1959\u201360[20][21] | 12 | 7 |  |  | 3[b] | 6 | 15 | 13\n |\n| 1960\u201361[20][21] | 13 | 10 |  |  | 9[c] | 1 | 22 | 11\n |\n| Total\n | 186 | 131 | 1 | 0 | 20 | 13 | 207 | 144\n |\n| Toronto City | 1962[20] | ECPSL |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Espanyol | 1963\u201364[20][21] | La Liga\n | 29 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 29 | 7\n |\n| Z\u00fcrich | 1965\u201366[20] | Nationalliga A | 12 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 7\n |\n| 1966\u201367[20][21] | 0 | 0 |  |  | 1[b] | 0 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 12 | 7 |  |  | 1 | 0 | 13 | 7\n |\n| Toronto Falcons | 1967[20] | NPSL | 19 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 5\n |\n| Career total\n | 391 | 229 | 1 | 0 | 21 | 13 | 413 | 242\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in European Cup\n3. **^** Eight appearances and one goal in European Cup, one appearance in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[21]\n| National team | Year | Apps | Goals\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Czechoslovakia | 1946 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1947 | 5 | 4\n |\n| Total | 6 | 4\n |\n| Hungary | 1948 | 3 | 0\n |\n| Total | 3 | 0\n |\n| Spain | 1953 | 3 | 1\n |\n| 1954 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1955 | 2 | 0\n |\n| 1956 | 4 | 4\n |\n| 1957 | 2 | 4\n |\n| 1958 | 3 | 2\n |\n| 1959 | 3 | 0\n |\n| 1960 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 1961 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total | 19 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 28\n | 15\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n**Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1951\u201352, 1952\u201353, 1958\u201359, 1959\u201360\n* Copa del General\u00edsimo: 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1959\n* Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: 1955\u201358, 1958\u201360\n* Latin Cup: 1952\n* Copa Eva Duarte: 1952, 1953\n* European Cup runner-up: 1960-61\n\n\n**Individual**\n\n\n\n* Ballon d'Or: fifth place 1957\n\n\n### Manager[edit]\n\n\n**M\u00e1laga**\n\n\n\n* Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 1987\u201388\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gaarskj\u00e6r, Jesper (2010). *Bar\u00e7a: Historien om FC Barcelona*.

Nicknamed \"***El Pistolero\"*** ('The Gunman'), Su\u00e1rez is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest strikers of all time.[2] He has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot and a Pichichi Trophy, and has scored over 500 career goals for club and country.[3]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Su\u00e1rez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth \u00a364.98 million (\u20ac82.3 million adjusted for inflation), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.\n\n\nDubbed *MSN*, Su\u00e1rez was part of a dominant trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, winning the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in his first season. In his second season, he won the Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[4] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.[5][6] With Barcelona, Su\u00e1rez won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2020, winning his fifth La Liga title in his second season.[7]\n\n\nAt international level, Su\u00e1rez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, and formerly held the title of highest scorer in CONMEBOL FIFA World Cup qualifiers before being surpassed by former teammate Lionel Messi.[8] He has represented his nation at four editions of the FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named in the 2010 World Cup All-Star Team and won the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was awarded Best Player. Outside of his football credentials, Su\u00e1rez has been a source of controversy throughout his career,[note 1] including a goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, biting opponents on three occasions,[note 2] accusations of diving,[16][17] and racial incidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Youth[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"As I was growing up, there was only one player I looked up to, and that was Batistuta, the Argentina No.9.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Su\u00e1rez on his childhood idol, Gabriel Batistuta.[18]\n\nSu\u00e1rez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo Artigas.[19] At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he played youth football at Urreta.[20] When he was a child, a car ran over his foot, breaking the fifth metatarsal bone. In spite of the injury, he continued to play.[21]\n\n\n\n### Nacional[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez joined local side Nac's youth team at age 14.[22] At age 16, Su\u00e1rez headbutted a referee after showing his discontent following a red card, although a sports editor claimed he \"accidentally fell into the referee\".[23] One night, he was caught drinking and partying, prompting his coach to threaten he would never play unless he started playing football more seriously.[22] In May 2005, at age 18, Su\u00e1rez made his first-team debut against Atl\u00e9tico Junior in the Copa Libertadores.[22] He scored his first goal in September 2005[24] and helped Nacional win the 2005\u201306 Uruguayan league with 10 goals in 27 matches.[25]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club Groningen when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a \"wonder goal\" against Defensor. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Su\u00e1rez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional \u20ac800,000 for him.[22] Su\u00e1rez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sof\u00eda Balbi, had moved to Barcelona; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Groningen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez on the training field of Groningen in 2006\nSu\u00e1rez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Su\u00e1rez struggled because he could not speak Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game.[26] His teammate and fellow Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, and his teammate R\u00f9fson, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team.[26] He worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language.[26] Su\u00e1rez scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007, he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card.[27] Su\u00e1rez especially made his mark in a 4\u20133 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two goals.[28] Su\u00e1rez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances[29] to help Groningen finish eighth in the 2006\u201307 Eredivisie.[26] He also scored in a 4\u20132 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut on 14 September 2006.[26][30]\n\n\nAjax saw potential in Su\u00e1rez and offered Groningen \u20ac3.5\u00a0million for him, but Groningen rejected the offer.[31] Su\u00e1rez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale.[31] The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to \u20ac7.5\u00a0million and Groningen accepted.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Ajax[edit]\n\n\n#### 2007\u201309: Development and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 August 2007 Su\u00e1rez signed a five-year contract with Ajax, for a transfer fee of \u20ac7.5 million,[31][33] and made his club debut in the UEFA Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague.[34] He scored one goal in his Eredivisie debut for the club[35] and two goals in his home debut at the Amsterdam Arena.[36] Ajax finished second in the league table in the 2007\u201308 season[37] and Su\u00e1rez scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances, setting up a blossoming striking partnership with league top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.[38]\n\n\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Ajax head coach Marco van Basten noted how Su\u00e1rez played an important role in many of Ajax's goals, but Van Basten was also upset by the number of yellow cards Su\u00e1rez received.[35] Su\u00e1rez was suspended for one match[39] because he was given his seventh yellow card of the season against Utrecht in a 2\u20130 win.[40] He was also suspended after a half-time altercation with teammate Albert Luque over a free kick.[27][35] Ajax ended the season in third place.[41] Su\u00e1rez scored 22 goals in 31 league matches[35][38] and finished second in scoring tables, one goal behind Mounir El Hamdaoui of AZ.[42] Su\u00e1rez was also named Ajax Player of the Year.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: League top goal scorer, Eredivisie winner[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (with the Ajax pennant) as Ajax captain in 2010.

Ajax suspended him for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount, which the club said they would donate to a \"good cause\".[58] The Dutch daily newspaper *De Telegraaf* branded Su\u00e1rez the \"Cannibal of Ajax\".[12][56] The KNVB increased Su\u00e1rez's suspension to seven league matches.[59] Su\u00e1rez apologized for his actions through a video he uploaded to his Facebook page.[56]\n\n\n\n### Liverpool[edit]\n\n\n#### Transfer[edit]\n\n\nDuring the suspension, Ajax were in contact with other European clubs interested in Su\u00e1rez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a \u20ac26.5\u00a0million (\u00a322.8\u00a0million) offer for Su\u00e1rez from Premier League club Liverpool.[60][61][62] Despite leaving while suspended, Su\u00e1rez departed Ajax on good terms, and he was given a farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club wished he could stay longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed.[63] Ajax ended the 2010\u201311 season as Eredivisie champions[64] and Su\u00e1rez was given a winner's medal[25][65] for his 7 goals in 13 appearances.[66]\n\n\nOn 31 January 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with Liverpool until 2016,[60][67] and was the club's most expensive signing (\u00a322.8\u00a0million) until the arrival of Andy Carroll (\u00a335\u00a0million) a few hours later.[68] Su\u00e1rez requested the number seven shirt, which had been worn by Liverpool legends Kenny Dalglish, his new manager, Kevin Keegan, and Peter Beardsley[69]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u201312: Early seasons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (left) was signed by Liverpool on the same day as Andy Carroll.\nSu\u00e1rez made his Liverpool debut on 2 February against Stoke City at Anfield in a 2\u20130 win; he came on as a substitute and scored Liverpool's second goal in front of the Kop in the 79th minute.[68][70] He was one of Liverpool's best players during his partial season[71][72] and helped Liverpool go from 12th in the league in mid-January[71] to finish sixth.[73] He finished the 2010\u201311 season with four goals in 13 games.[66]\n\n\nAfter winning the Player of the Tournament at the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica,[74] Su\u00e1rez had a disappointing 2011\u201312 season by his standards.[75] Liverpool finished in eighth place and Su\u00e1rez scored 11 league goals.[75] On 26 February, Liverpool won the League Cup, defeating Cardiff City in a penalty shootout.[76] On 28 April, Su\u00e1rez scored his first Liverpool hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win against Norwich City at Carrow Road.[77] He finished sixth for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Racial abuse incident[edit]\n\n\nThe season was marked by an incident in which Su\u00e1rez was found guilty by a three-man panel from The Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October; he was issued an eight-match suspension and a \u00a340,000 fine.[79] Su\u00e1rez disputed this decision.[80]\n\n\nAfter a 1\u20131 draw against Manchester United on 15 October 2011, Su\u00e1rez was accused of racially abusing Evra,[81] and the FA opened up an investigation into the incident.[81] Su\u00e1rez wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages that he was upset by the accusation and denied the claims.[82] On 16 November, the FA announced it would charge Su\u00e1rez with \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules\", including \"a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra\". Liverpool later released a statement announcing Su\u00e1rez would plead innocent, adding they would \"remain fully supportive\" of him.[83] On 20 December, the FA concluded a seven-day hearing, handing Su\u00e1rez an eight-match ban and a \u00a340,000 fine for racially abusing Evra.[84][85][86]\n\n\nIn their next meeting in February, during the pregame handshakes, Su\u00e1rez avoided shaking Evra's hand, for which Su\u00e1rez and Dalglish were later forced to apologise.[87] Su\u00e1rez was also banned for one match for making an obscene gesture towards Fulham fans.[88]\n\n\n\n#### 2012\u201313: Return and individual success[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 August 2012, Su\u00e1rez signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool.[89] On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the 2012\u201313 season in a 2\u20132 draw with champions Manchester City at Anfield.[90] On 29 September 2012, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick in Liverpool's Premier League fixture away at Norwich City for the second consecutive season.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez playing for Liverpool against Arsenal in January 2013\nOn 6 January 2013, Su\u00e1rez handled the ball before scoring the decisive goal in Liverpool's 2\u20131 win over Mansfield Town from the Conference National in an FA Cup third round match. Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player by claiming \"it's not his job to own up\", while Mansfield manager Paul Cox said he felt \"a little bit gutted\" by the \"instinctive\" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.[92]\n\n\nOn 19 January, Su\u00e1rez scored his seventh goal in three matches against Norwich, as Liverpool cruised to a 5\u20130 home league victory.[93] The following week, Su\u00e1rez captained Liverpool for the first time for the FA Cup fourth round match against Oldham Athletic; Liverpool lost 2\u20133.[94] On 2 March, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic, leading Liverpool to a dominant 4\u20130 victory at the DW Stadium. In so doing, he became only the third Liverpool player to score 20 Premier League goals in a single season after Robbie Fowler and Fernando Torres.[95] On 10 March, Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th goal in all competitions since joining *the Reds* by scoring the opener in a 3\u20132 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ending Spurs' 12-match unbeaten run. He was also named man of the match for his performance after he won the decisive penalty which Steven Gerrard converted.\n\n\nAt the end of the season, Su\u00e1rez was one of six players named on the shortlist for PFA Players' Player of the Year.[96] Su\u00e1rez finished second in the final ballot behind Gareth Bale of Tottenham[97] and was named in the PFA Team of the Year.[97] He was second-top goalscorer in the Premier League for 2012\u201313 with 23 goals and Liverpool's top scorer in all competitions with 30 goals.[98] On 28 May 2013, he was named as Liverpool's player of the season after receiving 64% of votes in a poll of the club's supporters.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez about to score a 35-yard free kick against Zenit Saint Petersburg, his second goal in a 3\u20131 win, March 2013\n#### Second biting incident[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2013, during a 2\u20132 draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield, Su\u00e1rez bit Branislav Ivanovi\u0107; this was the second time Su\u00e1rez had bitten an opponent.[100] It was not noticed by the officials, and Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer in injury time.[13] The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Su\u00e1rez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club.[101] Contrary to claims from Su\u00e1rez, Ivanovi\u0107 did not accept an apology.[101] Su\u00e1rez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence.[102] A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Su\u00e1rez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticized Su\u00e1rez for not appreciating \"the seriousness\" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game \u2013 especially to young players\".[103]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2013, Su\u00e1rez said he would be seeking an exit from Liverpool in the summer, citing excessive media attention on his family as a reason for wanting to leave.[104] On 6 August, after Liverpool had rejected a bid of \u00a340,000,001 for the player from Arsenal, Su\u00e1rez reiterated his wish to leave Liverpool and said Liverpool had previously promised to allow him a transfer if the club failed to qualify for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League.[105] The following day, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool had not broken any promises to Su\u00e1rez and that the player had shown \"total disrespect\" for the club.[106] After this incident, the British press reported that Su\u00e1rez had been instructed to train away from the Liverpool first-team squad by Rodgers.[106][107][108] On 8 August, Liverpool owner John W. Henry stated that Su\u00e1rez would not be allowed to leave the club.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u201314: European Golden Shoe and departure[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 August, Su\u00e1rez reversed his position about wanting to leave the club, with reports stating he wanted to stay at the club and that he was possibly going to sign a contract extension, citing the support from Liverpool supporters as the reason for his unexpected turnaround.[110][111] Su\u00e1rez returned to first-team training two days later after \"offer[ing] contrition\" to his teammates but reportedly not apologizing to his manager.[112] On 25 September, Su\u00e1rez returned to the Liverpool team after his suspension to make his first appearance of the 2013\u201314 season in a League Cup third round tie against Manchester United at Old Trafford, losing 1\u20130.[113][114] On 29 September, Su\u00e1rez made his first Premier League appearance of the season, scoring twice as Liverpool defeated Sunderland 3\u20131 at the Stadium of Light.[115] On 26 October, he scored his fourth Premier League hat-trick, his first at Anfield, in a 4\u20131 defeat of West Bromwich Albion.[116]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"He [Su\u00e1rez] has shown in his time at Liverpool in the last year or so that he is near unplayable.

His second broke a tie in the 80th minute when he dribbled around a defender and curled a \"spectacular shot\"[281] in off the far post; Su\u00e1rez was again named Man of the Match.[281] This win put Uruguay through to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970.[282] In the quarter-final against Ghana, the score was 1\u20131 at the end of regulation and the match went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free-kick into the box, and Su\u00e1rez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line.[283] He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goal bound header with his hands,[284] committing a professional foul[56] to save what would have been the game winner[285] and was sent off. Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar with the ensuing penalty kick[283] and Su\u00e1rez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading down the tunnel.[286][287] Uruguay won the shootout 4\u20132 and advanced to the semi-finals.[283][288]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"The Hand of God now belongs to me. Mine is the real Hand of God.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014After using his hand in the quarter-final against Ghana, Su\u00e1rez referred to Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal against England in 1986.[289]\n\nAfter the match, Su\u00e1rez said, \"I made the save of the tournament.\"[285] He said he had no alternative, was acting out of instinct, and would do it again if it helped his team win.[290] Ghana head coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an \"injustice\"[286] and Su\u00e1rez was labelled a villain and a cheater.[291][290] Others viewed him as a hero.[56][292] Due to the automatic suspension that accompanies a red card, Su\u00e1rez sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance the penalty would be missed, and his team would later win.[27][291]\n\n\nWhile Su\u00e1rez was suspended for the semi-final match for his red card against Ghana,[293] Uruguay \"lacked a second striker [alongside Diego Forl\u00e1n] of cunning and movement\"[294] and lost 3\u20132 to the Netherlands.[295][296] Su\u00e1rez returned for the third place game against Germany; he was booed almost every time he had the ball because of his handball in the Ghana match.[297] He assisted Cavani on Uruguay's first goal,[298] but Uruguay lost 3\u20132.[297] During the tournament, Su\u00e1rez played 543 minutes in six appearances and scored three goals.[299]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez was named most valuable player of the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica\nIn the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Su\u00e1rez scored in Uruguay's opening game, a 1\u20131 draw with Peru.[300] In their next game, he provided the assist for Alvaro Pereira's goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Chile.[301] Uruguay finished second in their group and advanced to the knockout round[302] with a win, 1\u20130 against Mexico, and two draws, against Peru and Chile.[303] In the quarter-finals, Uruguay drew with tournament hosts Argentina 1\u20131 after regulation and extra time. Uruguay won the shootout 5\u20134 and Su\u00e1rez converted his penalty.[304][305] Su\u00e1rez scored both goals in Uruguay's 2\u20130 semi-final win over Peru and was named Man of the Match.[306] In the final, Su\u00e1rez scored the opening goal and set up Diego Forlan's second goal as Uruguay defeated Paraguay 3\u20130 for their record 15th Copa Am\u00e9rica title.[307][308] Su\u00e1rez scored four goals and provided two assists during the tournament and was named MVP of the Tournament.[307][43][309]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 July 2012, Su\u00e1rez was selected for the Uruguay Olympic football team alongside Liverpool teammate Sebasti\u00e1n Coates to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games.[310] In the first pre-tournament warm-up game against Chile on 11 July, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick for Uruguay as they came from 0\u20132 down to win 6\u20134 in a thrilling match.[311]\n\n\nAs one of Uruguay's three overage players, Su\u00e1rez was named as captain for the Olympic Games.[312] After an opening win over the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay were defeated by Senegal and Great Britain and eliminated at the first round. Su\u00e1rez failed to score during the tournament.\n\n\n\n### 2013 Confederations Cup[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was selected in the Uruguay squad to play in Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup. He scored a curling free-kick from 30 yards (27\u00a0m) in a 2\u20131 defeat to Spain in their opening match at Recife on 16 June.[313] He then scored twice after appearing as a substitute in Uruguay's 8\u20130 win over Tahiti, making him the Uruguay national team's all-time top-goalscorer with 35 goals, surpassing his teammate Diego Forl\u00e1n.[314] Uruguay were eventually eliminated in the semi-finals, losing 2\u20131 to Brazil in Belo Horizonte.[315]\n\n\n\n### 2014 FIFA World Cup, third biting incident[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (middle) celebrating one of his two goals against England at the 2014 World Cup\nSu\u00e1rez ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the South American section with 11 goals in 14 matches.[316] In November 2013, Uruguay defeated Jordan 5\u20130 on aggregate in an intercontinental play-off to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.[317]\n\n\nOn 22 May, Su\u00e1rez underwent emergency surgery on his left knee. He was confined to a wheelchair for a time, leading to rumours he would be unable to participate in the World Cup.[318][319][320] He was named as a substitute for Uruguay's first match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Costa Rica, but did not play in the match. Su\u00e1rez started Uruguay's second match against England and scored both of the team's goals in a 2\u20131 win at the Arena Corinthians in S\u00e3o Paulo.[321]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"These are just things that happen out on the pitch.

I apologize to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be another incident like [this].\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Su\u00e1rez on 30 June 2014.[324]\n\nFor Uruguay's final group match against Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the knockout stage while Italy only needed a draw.[325] Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0\u20130, Su\u00e1rez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Su\u00e1rez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Su\u00e1rez falling and clutching his face.[14][326] The controversial incident made headline news around the world.[327] As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez for not penalizing Su\u00e1rez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1\u20130 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.[14][326][328]\n\n\nTwo days later, on 26 June, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, banned Su\u00e1rez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup.[145][329] He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000.[145][329] The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Su\u00e1rez's defense that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was \"deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilizing him\". The severity of the penalty was due to the fact it was Su\u00e1rez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse.[323] Soon after the suspension was announced, online gambling firm 888poker cancelled its sponsorship deal with Su\u00e1rez.[330] With Su\u00e1rez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 0\u20132 to Colombia and were eliminated from the World Cup.[331]\n\n\nOn the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal the suspension.[332] Su\u00e1rez's lawyer said that \"we don't have any doubts\" of a European-based campaign against Su\u00e1rez.[333] Various Uruguayan individuals defended Su\u00e1rez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticized the severity of his ban, including President of Uruguay Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who labelled the ban \"fascist\" and called FIFA \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\";[334][335] AUF president Wilmar Valdez;[332] Uruguay captain Diego Lugano;[336] and Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest of the ban.[337] The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood.[338] For non-Uruguayan parties, Chiellini, who was bitten, called the ban \"excessive\", while international players' union FIFPro called for Su\u00e1rez to \"receive all the support he needs\" and that the \"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\" of Su\u00e1rez.[337]\n\n\nSix days after the incident, on 30 June, Su\u00e1rez apologized to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini.[324][339] Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Su\u00e1rez's suspension.[339][340]\n\n\nOn 3 July, the AUF appealed Su\u00e1rez's ban,[341] but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July.[342][343] With Su\u00e1rez's ban not preventing him from transferring to another club,[344] it was announced on 11 July that Su\u00e1rez had agreed to move to Barcelona.[345][346][347] Days before the transfer, Su\u00e1rez's apology to Chiellini had been praised by various Barcelona club individuals. Barcelona club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \"honorable\", sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Su\u00e1rez as being \"humble enough to admit an error\" while new signing Ivan Rakiti\u0107 commended Su\u00e1rez's \"character and strength\".[348][349]\n\n\n\n### Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario and 2018 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez playing against Portugal in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup\nOn 25 March 2016, after over a year of international absence for Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer against Brazil in Recife for a 2\u20132 draw in the qualification process for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[350] Su\u00e1rez was included in Uruguay's 23-man squad for the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, although a hamstring injury sustained in the Copa del Rey final on 22 May put his place in the team in jeopardy.[180][179] Although he remained in the squad, he missed both of his national side's opening group losses to Mexico and Venezuela, which resulted in a first-round elimination from the tournament.[351] He was once again left on the substitutes' bench in Uruguay's final 3\u20130 group win over Jamaica on 13 June.[352]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez scored twice on 10 October 2017 as Uruguay won 4\u20132 at home to Bolivia in their final World Cup qualifying match, thus securing their place for the tournament in Russia, as well as becoming the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Argentina's Lionel Messi, overtaking the previous record which was held by Hern\u00e1n Crespo.[353][354] In March, Uruguay won the 2018 China Cup, and Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th international goal with a penalty against the Czech Republic in the semi-finals, winning it himself when fouled by goalkeeper Ji\u0159\u00ed Pavlenka.[355] He won his 100th cap on 20 June 2018 in Uruguay's second group match at the World Cup, scoring the only goal against Saudi Arabia at the Rostov Arena in Rostov-on-Don to advance the nation into the last 16, for which Su\u00e1rez was given man of the match.[356] In the final group game on 25 June, Su\u00e1rez was again named the man of the match as he scored Uruguay's opener with a free kick into the bottom corner in a 3\u20130 win over hosts Russia.[357] In the Round of 16 match against Portugal on 30 June, he set-up Cavani's opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 victory.[358] Uruguay were eliminated from the tournament following a 2\u20130 defeat to France in the quarter-finals on 6 July.[359]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u20132020: Qualifiers and Copa Am\u00e9rica upset[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, manager Tab\u00e1rez included Su\u00e1rez in the final 23-man Uruguay squad for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[360] On 16 June, he scored the third goal in a 4\u20130 win over Ecuador in the team's opening group match of the tournament, also setting up the opener scored by Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro.[361]\n\n\nIn the quarter-finals against Peru on 29 June, he had a goal disallowed by VAR for offside, and was subsequently the only player to miss his spot-kick in the resulting penalty shoot-out, following a 0\u20130 draw after regulation time, which saw Uruguay eliminated from the competition.[362]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2020, Su\u00e1rez scored the first goal of the South American 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, becoming the first player ever to score the opening goal three times (after his 2010 and 2014 strikes) in the competition's history.[363]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present: Copa Am\u00e9rica and 2022 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 June 2021, Su\u00e1rez scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Chile in Uruguay's second group match of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[364] However, Uruguay lost against Colombia in the quarter-finals on penalties after a goalless draw.[365]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2022, in Uruguay's final group match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar against Ghana, Su\u00e1rez assisted Giorgian de Arrascaeta's second goal of the match to give Uruguay a 2\u20130 win; however, group rivals South Korea scored a late goal to win 2\u20131 against Portugal, advancing from the group stage having scored four goals to Uruguay\u2019s two (both teams were tied at 4 points and a 0 goal difference).[366]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez in action for Liverpool takes on Sylvain Distin of Everton during the Merseyside Derby in 2012\nSu\u00e1rez creates goal scoring chances with his powerful shot, and has \"remarkable technical ability\" according to his FIFA profile.[367] Known for his direct running at players, Su\u00e1rez has a particular penchant for nutmegging opponents (putting the ball through their legs).[368] Liverpool fans (accompanied with a banner) used to say he was so good, \"he could nutmeg a mermaid\".[369] Often regarded by many as one of the best strikers of all time,[note 3] Su\u00e1rez is a prolific goal scorer, having the rare distinction of being the leading scorer in three top-flight European leagues, a feat only matched by Ruud van Nistelrooy[376] and Cristiano Ronaldo.[377] An accurate finisher[378] with either foot,[379] despite being naturally right-footed,[380] he is capable of scoring from both inside[381] and outside the penalty area.[382]\n\n\nHarry Redknapp said that Su\u00e1rez could play anywhere \u2013 as the target man or behind as a second striker. Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez called Su\u00e1rez \"a great forward, an elite player among forwards in the world\",[383] and Liverpool coach Kenny Dalglish said, \"he's intelligent, he's had a fantastic education at Ajax\".[384] Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said his abilities allow him to get into a position to score and evade defenders.[385][386] Meanwhile, Thierry Henry called Su\u00e1rez the best striker in the world, stating, \"He has everything. He's in your face, he's arrogant- in a good way, he can volley it, he can score headers. He has vicious side to his game and I will not call it cheating. He knows how to score goals.\"[387]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been praised for his work rate,[385] movement,[388] and his quickness[384] that allows him to attack from the outside;[367] as such he occasionally played as an inverted winger on the left flank during his time with Ajax.[389] Additionally, Su\u00e1rez has a liking for often executing dummies (going around the defenders with a fake-out) within his style of dribbling.[390] During his time in Barcelona, he was known for constantly scoring through volleys or half-volleys.[391][392] Su\u00e1rez also gained a reputation for consistently scoring acrobatic goals, often shooting off balance, or in air, or with overhead bicycle kicks.[393][394][395] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick taker,[396] and has also been known to take penalties.[397]\n\n\nHe also creates many scoring opportunities for his teammates with his vision and great passing abilities, as is reflected in his numbers of assists, among the very highest within the stat's recorded history.[398] Former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, lauded Su\u00e1rez's unselfish playstyle within his autobiography, stating how that \"It's a rare combination, to be a miraculous footballer who is willing to use his gifts to selflessly assist and create goals for a teammate\", as well as further writing, \"He scores goals. He creates goals. He's hard and horrible to play against. You've got a chance of beating anyone in the world with Luis Su\u00e1rez in your team\".[399][400]\n\n\nIn addition to being a prolific player, Su\u00e1rez has often been praised for his strong mentality and desire to win. Former Liverpool teammate, Jordan Henderson dubbed Su\u00e1rez as a \"warrior\", claiming that his attitude inspired confidence among his teammates.[401] Meanwhile, Gerrard eulogized his drive to succeed, stating \"Luis played to win a five-a-side training session like he was chasing the Champions League or the World Cup. If his team lost a kickaround he went home angry; he always needed to win that badly\".[400] Atletico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone hailed Su\u00e1rez for the \"desire and energy\" he brought to the club.[402] Su\u00e1rez, himself, has stated that he's the kind of player who would \"kill himself just to prevent a throw-in at the 90th minute.\" in his autobiography.[403]\n\n\nFormer Ajax coach Marco van Basten criticized Su\u00e1rez for his tendency to receive yellow cards.[35] Van Basten said he had a tense relationship with Su\u00e1rez,[35] although he conceded that \"Luis is unpredictable, he's hard to influence but that makes him special.\"[35] At times, Su\u00e1rez can be dominant but fail to convert his efforts into goals.[404] Despite his weaknesses, Su\u00e1rez's leadership stood out to Ajax management.[60]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been widely accused of diving.[note 4] His manager, teammates and various analysts have commented that this reputation for simulation has caused referees not to award him legitimate penalties.[408][409] In January 2013, Su\u00e1rez admitted to diving against Stoke City in an October 2012 match. This led his manager Brendan Rodgers to comment his actions were \"unacceptable\" and that he would be dealt with \"internally\" by the club.[410] During the 2018 World Cup game against Portugal, after collisions with Portuguese players, Suarez twice acted like he had a head injury despite his head having been untouched.[411]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez is infamous for biting opponents on multiple occasions. In a Group D matchup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Suarez was shown to have bitten Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, resulting in FIFA suspending Suarez from all football activities for 4 months. While playing for Liverpool, Suarez bit Chelsea player Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 in a Premier League match, and was punished with a ten match ban. In an earlier incident while playing for AFC Ajax he was caught biting PSV Eindhoven player Otman Bakkal and was suspended for seven games.[100] Su\u00e1rez has also been accused of stamping on opponents in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League.[412][413][414][415]\n\n\nDue to his diving, biting, stamping, and other antics, Su\u00e1rez has been frequently labelled as a pest and a cheat.[416] In December 2013, Spanish football website *El Gol Digital* ranked Su\u00e1rez at fifth in its list of the world's dirtiest footballers.[417]\n\n\n\n## Media and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Previously with Adidas, Su\u00e1rez has been sponsored by Puma since 2018. He wears Puma Future 2.1.\nSu\u00e1rez had a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas, before switching to rivals Puma in 2018.[418] Su\u00e1rez starred in a 2014 advert for Beats with other global football stars including Neymar and Thierry Henry, with the theme of \"The Game Before the Game\" and the players' pre-game ritual of listening to music.[419] In Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez has also appeared in advertisements for Abitab, Antel, Cablevisi\u00f3n, Garnier, Pepsi and Samsung.[420][421]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez features in EA Sports' *FIFA* video game series: as a result of Su\u00e1rez's ban for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup, players in *FIFA 15* were unable to select Su\u00e1rez until his ban ended on 26 October.[422]\n\n\nActive on social media, Su\u00e1rez has over 40 million Instagram followers as of May 2020, the most for a person from Uruguay.[423][424]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was born in Salto, Uruguay to Sandra Diaz and Rodolfo Su\u00e1rez, the fourth of seven boys.[27][425] His older brother, Paolo Su\u00e1rez, is a retired professional footballer, who last played for Isidro Metap\u00e1n in El Salvador.\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez moved with his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.[425] In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,[24][425] while also taking up work as a street sweeper at the age of 15.[23] In 1998, aged 11 he appeared as a contestant on children's game show *Aventujuegos*, with his team winning: his episode was brought up in a 2011 episode of chat show *Noche de Locura* and he was surprised the footage had been kept.[3]\n\n\nThe contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.[23] Besides his native tongue, Su\u00e1rez is able to speak Dutch and English.[426][427]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mural of Su\u00e1rez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay\nSu\u00e1rez is of mixed race and has a black grandfather.[428] The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the Patrice Evra incident, where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of \"*mi negrito*\" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Su\u00e1rez's repeated use of \"negro\" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable, issuing him an eight-match ban. His mother also supported the claim Su\u00e1rez made that using the word was not racist in Uruguay. She said it was \"normal\", and that it was \"a word people use with their friends. It's like calling someone fat, thin or whatever.\"[429]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began dating Sof\u00eda Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to Barcelona in 2003, and Su\u00e1rez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sof\u00eda again.[23] Su\u00e1rez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter named Delfina (born 2010) [430]and two sons named Benjamin (born 2013) and Lauti (born 2018).[431][27][432] He has a tattoo of his daughter's name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his goal celebration \u2013 this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports\u2019 video game *FIFA 15* as \"Kiss The Wrist\".[433][434] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer to Sof\u00eda's family. On the move, Su\u00e1rez said, \"[Liverpool] did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right.\"[435] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez released his autobiography, *Crossing the Line \u2013 My Story*.[436][437]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez, who is married to an Italian citizen, was eligible to take a B1 Italian Language exam and flew to Perugia in September 2020 to take the test and gain Italian citizenship. Though obtaining the results of the language exam and approval of citizenship takes several months and several years respectively to be processed, Su\u00e1rez reportedly got his language exam results within hours and would have his citizenship approved in several weeks. The Italian media had noted that this led to accusations of special treatment against Su\u00e1rez, especially as Italian laws had been changed in 2018 to make obtaining citizenship by marriage more difficult.[438] In September 2020, an investigation was launched over accusations that he had cheated his way into gaining Italian citizenship.[234]\n\n\nIt is known that Su\u00e1rez has used his experience and knowledge to mentor new Uruguayan footballing talents, most notably Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.[439]\n\n\n\n### Pandora Papers[edit]\n\n\nHe is among the 13 sports personalities mentioned

He later coached Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 187 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Su\u00e1rez, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, C\u00e9sar, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the *midfield general* role and was nicknamed *Surrealista* (*The Surrealist*) and *Home Magosta* (*The Grasshopper Man*)[3] due to his style.\n\n\nAs a manager, he led Barcelona to a title in La Liga in 1945, and as a scout he recruited another Barcelona legend, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala. However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di St\u00e9fano affair,[3] twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco,[3] Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona.[*citation needed*] When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Samitier played as a junior for FC Internacional before, at the age of 17, he made his debut for FC Barcelona in 1919. As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqu\u00e9s, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dal\u00ed. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928.\n\n\n\n### Madrid CF[edit]\n\n\nIn 1933 an aging Samiter found himself in dispute with the FC Barcelona management and he was dropped from the first team. Real Madrid, then known as *Madrid CF*, were quick to take advantage of the situation. Samitier was reunited with both his friend Ricardo Zamora and then Francisco Bru. Although his career with the Madrid club was short, he did help them win a title in La Liga 1932\u201333 and the Copa de Espa\u00f1a in 1934.\n\n\n\n### Samitier Tribute[edit]\n\n\nThe tribute match to Samitier was held on 13 May 1934 at Estadio Chamart\u00edn in Madrid, between Madrid FC and Espanyol, and Samitier scored both the first and the last goals of an 8\u20132 win. Other Madrid goalscorers include the likes of Eugenio, Hilario, Luis Regueiro and Lazcano, while Jos\u00e9 Padr\u00f3n scored one of Espanyol's consolation goals.\n\n\n**Madrid**: Zamora (Cayol 45\u00b4); Quesada, Maci\u00e1, P. Regueiro (Sauto), Bonet, Gurruchaga, (Valle 45\u00b4), Lazcano, L. Regueiro (Olivares 45\u00b4) Samitier, Hilario and Eugenio.\n\n\n**Espanyol**: Martorell (Eizaguirre 45\u00b4); Mas, P\u00e9rez, Cifuentes, Sol\u00e9 (Antero 45\u00b4), Cristi\u00e0, Prats, Edelmiro, Iriondo, Padr\u00f3n and Bosch.\n\n\n\n### Exile in France[edit]\n\n\nIn 1936 Samitier made a brief start to his career as a coach. He succeeded Fred Pentland at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the middle of the season, but failed to prevent them from being relegated. However, Samitier's new career and Atl\u00e9tico's relegation were postponed with the start of the Spanish Civil War. He found himself arrested by an anarchist militia, but was eventually released and left for France on a warship. His *escape* was later used by the Nationalist side in an account printed in *Marca*. In October 1936 he joined OGC Nice as a player, where he was reunited once again with Ricardo Zamora. He subsequently scored 21 goals in 48 matches for the French team.[5] He eventually retired as a player in 1939 and was briefly coach at OGC Nice in 1942.\n\n\n\n### Return to Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nSamitier returned to Spain and became manager of CF Barcelona in 1944. In 1945 he guided them to only their second ever La Liga title. Then they beat the Copa del General\u00edsimo winners Atl\u00e9tico Bilbao to win the Copa de Oro Argentina. Samitier subsequently worked as the clubs *chief scout* and was instrumental in the recruitment of another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1950 Kubala arrived in Spain with his own team, *Hungaria*. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. They played a series of friendlies against a *Madrid Select XI*, a Spain XI and RCD Espa\u00f1ol. During these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Samitier. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was then persuaded by Samitier to sign for CF Barcelona. It has been suggested that Samitier used his connections within Francoist Spain to help arrange the transfer. In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used by Francoist Spain and was made into a film *The Stars Search for Peace* which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1920, together with Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga, Pichichi and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Belauste, Samitier was a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games.[6] He subsequently made 21 appearances and scored 2 goals for Spain.[1]\n\n\nSamitier also played 26 games and scored at least 20 goals for the Catalan XI.[*citation needed*] However, records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played and scored more. Together with Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Sagibarba and Zamora, he helped the Catalan XI win the Prince of Asturias Cup twice in the 1920s, winning the inter-regional competition in 1923\u201324 and 1926. In the 1924 final, he scored twice in a 4\u20134 draw against Castile/Madrid XI and scored again in the replay as the Catalan team won 3\u20132.[7] Catalonia faced Czechoslovakia twice in 1925 and 1926, and Samitier managed to score in both games, a 2\u20131 win and a 2\u20131 defeat, respecteviely.[8][9] His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 19 January 1936 at the *Les Corts*.

Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la m\u00e1scara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017\u201318 league campaign, against Espanyol in *Derbi barcelon\u00ed*, thus helping to secure a 5\u20130 home victory for *Blaugrana* over local rivals.[226] Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Bar\u00e7a defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3\u20130 at home in the UEFA Champions League.[227] On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6\u20131 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga.[228] Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Bar\u00e7a defeat Las Palmas 3\u20130 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n185. **^** Rice, Simon (7 December 2015). \"Lionel Messi, Manchester United and Arsenal: The 10 Most Tweeted Sporting Moments of 2015\". *The Independent*.

A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2\u20130 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which \u2013 a slaloming dribble past three Real players \u2013 was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[108] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[109][110] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Bar\u00e7a's 3\u20131 victory.[111][112] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4\u20130 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2\u20130, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of \u20ac250\u00a0million, while his salary increased to \u20ac12\u00a0million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2003\u201304 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[31] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the *Juveniles* B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the *Juveniles A*, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[32][33] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous.

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice.

debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[37] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[44][45] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys in Montju\u00efc, coming on in the 82nd

by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[148] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3\u20131 home victory over Olympiacos.[230] Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart.[231] On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2\u20131 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.[232] Following the reception of his fourth Golden Boot, Messi signed a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November, keeping him with the club through the 2020\u201321 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2\u20130 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[376] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[377] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[378] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1\u20130 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[379] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[380]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004\u20132005: success at youth level[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIFFHS World's Best Player\n |\n| --- |\n| **Men's winners**\n* 1988: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1989: ![Netherlands](image) Van Basten\n* 1990: ![West Germany](image) Matth\u00e4us\n* 1991\u20132019: not awarded\n* 2020: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2021: ![Poland](image) Lewandowski\n* 2022: ![Argentina](image) Messi\n* 2023: ![Norway](image) Haaland\n |\n| **Women's winners**\n- 2020: ![Denmark](image) Harder\n\n- 2021: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2022: ![Spain](image) Putellas\n\n- 2023: ![Spain](image) Bonmat\u00ed\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bar\u00e7a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[19][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak\u00e1 and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak\u00e1.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007\u201308 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** Jenson, Pete (24 March 2014). \"Real Madrid 3 Barcelona 4 Match Report: Lionel Messi Hat-Trick Out-Guns Cristiano Ronaldo in Seven-Goal El Cl\u00e1sico Thriller\". *The Independent*.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pel\u00e9 as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[508] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3\u20130 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[509] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5\u20130 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s among the all-time international men's top scorers.[510]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[54] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of \u20ac7.8\u00a0million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66\u00a0yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[19][69] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[70] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[71][72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n644. **^** \"Lionel Messi's wife explains her absence at World Cup opener that left him broken hearted\". *USAHint*. 21 June 2018.

He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[662] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[663]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2008 UEFA Team of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK: Casillas\n* RB: Ramos\n* CB: Terry\n* CB: Puyol\n* LB: Lahm\n* MF: C.

Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice.

In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6\u20130 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[391] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0\u20130 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[392][393] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1\u20131. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n623. **^** Henry, Thierry (21 April 2011). \"The 2011 Time 100: Lionel Messi, God of the Field\". *Time*.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent *La Albiceleste* since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8\u20130 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n370. **^** \"Inter Miami CF Signs Seven-Time Ballon d'Or Winner, World Cup Champion, Lionel Messi | Inter Miami CF\". *Inter Miami CF*. 15 July 2023.

During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of '87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[16][17] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment.[19][20] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I've ever seen\".[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[538][539]\n\n\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[540] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[541][542][543] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[532][544] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[545] the most among active players.[546] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[547]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[404] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[405] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2\u20131 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1\u20130 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2\u20131 win in extra time. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n320. **^** Thomas, Lyall; Solhekol, Kaveh (8 August 2021). \"Lionel Messi 'shocked' and 'surprised' at Barcelona contract collapse\". *Sky Sports*.

He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2\u20130 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[529] In the following match against Cura\u00e7ao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7\u20130 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.[530]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n364. **^** Balague, Guillem (7 June 2023). \"Lionel Messi to join Inter Miami after leaving Paris St-Germain\". *BBC Sport*.

He ended the season with the highest number of assists in the league with 16 and was also included in the UNFP's Ligue 1 Team of the Season alongside teammates Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Mbapp\u00e9.[362][363]\n\n\n\n### Inter Miami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Messi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup\nFollowing confirmation of his departure from PSG, Messi was linked with a return to former club Barcelona, as well as with a big-money move to Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal, but his eventual decision to sign for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami was communicated to Barcelona president Joan Laporta by 5 June 2023.[364][365] Barcelona were unable to sign him due to financial constraints.[366]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7\u20130 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[151] These matches gave credence to the notion of *Messidependencia*, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[151]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHis former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[16] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against *La Raz\u00f3n* newspaper and was awarded \u20ac65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[668] Messi made a donation worth \u20ac1\u00a0million ($1.1\u00a0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[669] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[670] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[671]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTowards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the *Juveniles* B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[32][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his debut for the club on 21 July in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a 2\u20131 victory.[374] After scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi opened the scoring in the 2023 Leagues Cup final against Nashville SC on 19 August before Nashville equalised in the second half. The game ended in a penalty shoot-out which Miami won, 10\u20139, with Messi scoring the first, giving the club their first ever trophy.[375]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[655] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The Best FIFA Men's Player | * 2016: ![Portugal](image) C.

At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 32 | 16 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 1[h] | 1 | 41 | 21\n |\n| Total\n | 58 | 22 | 2 | 0 | 14 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 75 | 32\n |\n| Inter Miami | 2023 | MLS | 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 7[i] | 10 | 14 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 615 | 508 | 83 | 56 | 163 | 129 | 37 | 33 | 899 | 726\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[672][673] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel\u00e9's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for \u00a3125,000.[674]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[317] with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[318] On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day.[319] The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[320] Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi's exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\".[321] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[322]\n\n\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain[edit]\n\n\n#### 2021\u201322: first season adjustments and seventh Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He played as a forward for Ferencv\u00e1ros, Slovan Bratislava, Barcelona, and Espanyol, among other clubs. Regarded as one of the best players in history, Kubala is considered a hero of FC Barcelona.[2] A Hungarian national by birth, he also held Czechoslovak and Spanish citizenship, and played for the national teams of all three countries.[3][4][5]\n\n\nKubala was noted for his quick and skilful dribbling, composed and powerful finishing, and accuracy from free kicks. During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\nKubala was born in Budapest, as were his parents, who came from mixed backgrounds. His mother, Anna Stecz, a factory worker, had Polish, Slovak and Hungarian roots, while his father, P\u00e1l Kubala Kurjas, a bricklayer, belonged to the Slovak minority of Hungary. Kubala described himself as a \"cosmopolitan\". He began his career as a junior player with Ganz TE, a factory team that played in the Hungarian third division. At the age of 11, he was playing in teams with other players who were three to five years older.[8] At the age of 18, he signed for Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC where he was a teammate of S\u00e1ndor Kocsis. In 1946, Kubala moved to Czechoslovakia, allegedly to avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined \u0160K Slovan Bratislava. In 1947, he married Anna Viola Dau\u010d\u00edkova, the sister of the Czechoslovakian national coach, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk. In 1948, Kubala returned to Hungary, again to allegedly avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined Vasas SC.\n\n\n\n### Refugee[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1949, as Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a communist satellite state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck. Initially, he arrived in the United States zone of Allied-occupied Austria and then moved on to Italy, where he played briefly for Pro Patria. In May 1949, he also agreed to play for Torino in a testimonial against S.L. Benfica but pulled out after his son became ill. On the way back from Lisbon, the plane carrying the Torino team crashed into the Superga hills, killing all 31 people on board.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian Football Federation accused Kubala of breach of contract, leaving the country without permission, and failure to do military service. FIFA backed them and imposed a one-year international ban. In January 1950, Kubala, with Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk as coach, formed his own team, *Hungaria*, which was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. In the summer of 1950, the team arrived in Spain to play a series of friendlies against a Madrid XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espanyol. They also played a friendly game against the legendary Millonarios FC lead by Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[9][10]\n\n\nDuring these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Jos\u00e9 Samitier, then chief scout at FC Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was persuaded by Samitier to sign for Barcelona. Samitier used his connections within the government of Francisco Franco to help arrange the transfer. Franco's government wanted to utilize Kubala's status as a refugee from one of the USSR's satellite countries to reinforce the regime's validity, thus helping Kubala obtain Spanish citizenship without delay.[11] In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used as propaganda by Franco's government and was made into a successful film, *The Stars Search for Peace*, which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nKubala signed for FC Barcelona on 15 June 1950, and as part of the deal, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk also became the Barcelona coach. However, the ban imposed on Kubala was still in place and he did not make his La Liga debut until 1951. He was permitted to play friendlies, and in two consecutive games against Frankfurter S.V., which FC Barcelona won 4\u20131 and 10\u20134, he scored six goals and assisted another five. He also played in the Copa del General\u00edsimo and helped the club win the trophy in 1951.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kubala (center) with special guests Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (left) and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s in a match held in his honour in 1961\nIn his first La Liga season, 1951\u201352, Kubala scored 26 goals in 19 games. This included 7 goals in a 9\u20130 win over Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, five against Celta de Vigo and hat-tricks against Sevilla and Racing de Santander. His seven goals against Gij\u00f3n remain the record for most goals scored in a single match in La Liga. He also scored in the Copa del General\u00edsimo final as Barcelona beat Valencia 4\u20132. This season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Coach Dau\u010d\u00edk and Kubala, together with players like Emilio Aldecoa, Velasco, Joan Segarra and Ramallets, inspired the team to win five trophies, including La Liga, the Copa del General\u00edsimo, the Latin Cup, and the Copa Eva Duarte. Kubala missed much of the 1952\u201353 season after contracting tuberculosis, which threatened to end his playing career. However, he made a miraculous recovery and returned to help Barcelona retain both La Liga and the Copa del General\u00edsimo. He also scored again in the Copa final win, a 2\u20131 win over Athletic Bilbao. During his time with Barcelona, he scored a total of 14 hat-tricks.\n\n\nIn 1958, Kubala persuaded two fellow Hungarian refugees S\u00e1ndor Kocsis and Zolt\u00e1n Czibor to join him at Barcelona. Together with a young Luis Su\u00e1rez and Evaristo, they formed the nucleus of the team that won a La Liga / Copa del General\u00edsimo double in 1959 and a La Liga / Fairs Cup double in 1960. However, Kubala found himself out of favour with coach Helenio Herrera and lost his place in the team. As a result, he missed the 1960 European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid which Barcelona lost 6\u20132 on aggregate. The result saw Herrera lose his job and Kubala restored to the team. In the 1961 European Cup, Barcelona became the first club to beat Real Madrid in the competition. Inspired by Kubala they won 4\u20133 on aggregate and subsequently reached the final where they lost to Benfica 2\u20133. Kubala briefly retired as a player in 1961 and initially became a youth coach at Barcelona, before becoming coach of the senior team for the 1962\u201363 season. However, after losing a Fairs Cup game to Red Star Belgrade, he was dismissed. In the summer of 1963, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.[14]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A statue of Kubala in the grounds of the Camp Nou\nKubala played for three international teams \u2013 Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Spain. While playing with \u0160K Slovan Bratislava, he appeared in six games and scored four goals for Czechoslovakia between 1946 and 1947. After returning to Budapest in 1948, he played three games for Hungary but failed to score. After adopting Spanish nationality, Kubala played 19 times and scored 11 goals for Spain between 1953 and 1961, being one of a small group to have played for the country having been born elsewhere. The highlight of his international career was a hat-trick for Spain against Turkey in 3\u20130 win in November 1957.[15][16] Despite playing for three countries, Kubala never played in the finals of a major international tournament. He was included in the Spain squad for the 1962 World Cup but, along with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, did not play due to injury.\n\n\nAs well as playing for three international teams, Kubala also played for both a Europe XI and the Catalan XI. On 21 October 1953, England played a Europe XI at Wembley Stadium to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Football Association and Kubala scored twice in the 4\u20134 draw. He also played four games and scored four times for the Catalan XI. On 26 January 1955, in a game against Bologna at Les Corts, he was joined by guest player Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano; the Catalan XI won 6\u20132 with two goals from Kubala and one from Di St\u00e9fano. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 4 March 1993 at the Montju\u00efc Stadium against an International XI. He played the opening ten minutes of the game at age 65.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Kubala accepted a contract as a player-coach with RCD Espanyol and teamed up with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. During his time at Espanyol he gave a La Liga debut to his son, Branko. In 1966, he joined FC Z\u00fcrich, again as player-coach, and made his last appearance in a European Cup game against the competition's eventual winners, Celtic. In 1967, Kubala went to Canada, where at Toronto Falcons he enjoyed something of family reunion with his father-in-law, Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk, his brother-in-law, Yanko Daucik and his son Branko. He appeared in 19 matches for Toronto, scoring five times.[17]\n\n\nBy the end of 1968, he had returned to La Liga, and after a brief spell at C\u00f3rdoba CF, he became coach of the Spain national team. Kubala ended the team's 11-year absence from the World Cup when he guided the team to the 1978 World Cup, but could not steer them through the first-round group stage. He also managed them at Euro 80, where they were again eliminated in the first round.\n\n\nIn 1980, he returned to Barcelona as a manager for a second short spell before moving to Saudi Arabia where he managed Al-Hilal. He subsequently managed three other La Liga clubs, including CD M\u00e1laga whom he guided to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n title in 1988. His last coaching position was with Paraguay in 1995.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\n| Club\n | Season\n | League\n | Cup\n | Continental\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals\n |\n| Ganz TE\n | 1943\u201344[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II | 9 | 2 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 2\n |\n| Ferencv\u00e1rosi | 1944[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1945[20] | 22 | 19 |  |  |  |  | 22 | 19\n |\n| 1945\u201346[20] | 27 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 27 | 14\n |\n| Total\n | 49 | 33 |  |  |  |  | 49 | 33\n |\n| Slovan Bratislava | 1946\u201347[20] | Czechoslovak First League | 24 | 13 |  |  |  |  | 24 | 13\n |\n| 1947\u201348[20] | 9 | 1 |  |  |  |  | 9 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 33 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 33 | 14\n |\n| Vasas | 1948\u201349[20] | Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I\n | 20 | 10 |  |  |  |  | 20 | 10\n |\n| 1949\u201350[20] | 12 | 6 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 6\n |\n| Total\n | 32 | 16 |  |  |  |  | 32 | 16\n |\n| Pro Patria | 1949\u201350[20] | Serie A | 16 | 9 |  |  |  |  | 16 | 9\n |\n| Hung\u00e1ria\n | 1950\u201351[20] |  | 6 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 6 | 5\n |\n| Barcelona | 1951\u201352[20][21] | La Liga | 19 | 26 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 26\n |\n| 1952\u201353[20][21] | 11 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 11 | 7\n |\n| 1953\u201354[20][21] | 28 | 23 |  |  |  |  | 28 | 23\n |\n| 1954\u201355[20][21] | 19 | 14 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 14\n |\n| 1955\u201356[20][21] | 25 | 14 |  |  | 3[a] | 3 | 28 | 17\n |\n| 1956\u201357[21] | 18 | 9 | 1 | 0 |  |  | 19 | 9\n |\n| 1957\u201358[21] | 21 | 12 |  |  |  |  | 21 | 12\n |\n| 1958\u201359[20][21] | 20 | 9 |  |  | 5[a] | 3 | 25 | 12\n |\n| 1959\u201360[20][21] | 12 | 7 |  |  | 3[b] | 6 | 15 | 13\n |\n| 1960\u201361[20][21] | 13 | 10 |  |  | 9[c] | 1 | 22 | 11\n |\n| Total\n | 186 | 131 | 1 | 0 | 20 | 13 | 207 | 144\n |\n| Toronto City | 1962[20] | ECPSL |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Espanyol | 1963\u201364[20][21] | La Liga\n | 29 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 29 | 7\n |\n| Z\u00fcrich | 1965\u201366[20] | Nationalliga A | 12 | 7 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 7\n |\n| 1966\u201367[20][21] | 0 | 0 |  |  | 1[b] | 0 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 12 | 7 |  |  | 1 | 0 | 13 | 7\n |\n| Toronto Falcons | 1967[20] | NPSL | 19 | 5 |  |  |  |  | 19 | 5\n |\n| Career total\n | 391 | 229 | 1 | 0 | 21 | 13 | 413 | 242\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appearances in European Cup\n3. **^** Eight appearances and one goal in European Cup, one appearance in Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[21]\n| National team | Year | Apps | Goals\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Czechoslovakia | 1946 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1947 | 5 | 4\n |\n| Total | 6 | 4\n |\n| Hungary | 1948 | 3 | 0\n |\n| Total | 3 | 0\n |\n| Spain | 1953 | 3 | 1\n |\n| 1954 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1955 | 2 | 0\n |\n| 1956 | 4 | 4\n |\n| 1957 | 2 | 4\n |\n| 1958 | 3 | 2\n |\n| 1959 | 3 | 0\n |\n| 1960 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 1961 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Total | 19 | 11\n |\n| Career total\n | 28\n | 15\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n**Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1951\u201352, 1952\u201353, 1958\u201359, 1959\u201360\n* Copa del General\u00edsimo: 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1959\n* Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: 1955\u201358, 1958\u201360\n* Latin Cup: 1952\n* Copa Eva Duarte: 1952, 1953\n* European Cup runner-up: 1960-61\n\n\n**Individual**\n\n\n\n* Ballon d'Or: fifth place 1957\n\n\n### Manager[edit]\n\n\n**M\u00e1laga**\n\n\n\n* Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 1987\u201388\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gaarskj\u00e6r, Jesper (2010). *Bar\u00e7a: Historien om FC Barcelona*.

Nicknamed \"***El Pistolero\"*** ('The Gunman'), Su\u00e1rez is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest strikers of all time.[2] He has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot and a Pichichi Trophy, and has scored over 500 career goals for club and country.[3]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Su\u00e1rez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth \u00a364.98 million (\u20ac82.3 million adjusted for inflation), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.\n\n\nDubbed *MSN*, Su\u00e1rez was part of a dominant trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, winning the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in his first season. In his second season, he won the Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[4] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.[5][6] With Barcelona, Su\u00e1rez won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2020, winning his fifth La Liga title in his second season.[7]\n\n\nAt international level, Su\u00e1rez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, and formerly held the title of highest scorer in CONMEBOL FIFA World Cup qualifiers before being surpassed by former teammate Lionel Messi.[8] He has represented his nation at four editions of the FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named in the 2010 World Cup All-Star Team and won the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was awarded Best Player. Outside of his football credentials, Su\u00e1rez has been a source of controversy throughout his career,[note 1] including a goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, biting opponents on three occasions,[note 2] accusations of diving,[16][17] and racial incidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Youth[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"As I was growing up, there was only one player I looked up to, and that was Batistuta, the Argentina No.9.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Su\u00e1rez on his childhood idol, Gabriel Batistuta.[18]\n\nSu\u00e1rez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo Artigas.[19] At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he played youth football at Urreta.[20] When he was a child, a car ran over his foot, breaking the fifth metatarsal bone. In spite of the injury, he continued to play.[21]\n\n\n\n### Nacional[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez joined local side Nac's youth team at age 14.[22] At age 16, Su\u00e1rez headbutted a referee after showing his discontent following a red card, although a sports editor claimed he \"accidentally fell into the referee\".[23] One night, he was caught drinking and partying, prompting his coach to threaten he would never play unless he started playing football more seriously.[22] In May 2005, at age 18, Su\u00e1rez made his first-team debut against Atl\u00e9tico Junior in the Copa Libertadores.[22] He scored his first goal in September 2005[24] and helped Nacional win the 2005\u201306 Uruguayan league with 10 goals in 27 matches.[25]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club Groningen when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a \"wonder goal\" against Defensor. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Su\u00e1rez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional \u20ac800,000 for him.[22] Su\u00e1rez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sof\u00eda Balbi, had moved to Barcelona; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Groningen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez on the training field of Groningen in 2006\nSu\u00e1rez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Su\u00e1rez struggled because he could not speak Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game.[26] His teammate and fellow Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, and his teammate R\u00f9fson, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team.[26] He worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language.[26] Su\u00e1rez scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007, he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card.[27] Su\u00e1rez especially made his mark in a 4\u20133 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two goals.[28] Su\u00e1rez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances[29] to help Groningen finish eighth in the 2006\u201307 Eredivisie.[26] He also scored in a 4\u20132 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut on 14 September 2006.[26][30]\n\n\nAjax saw potential in Su\u00e1rez and offered Groningen \u20ac3.5\u00a0million for him, but Groningen rejected the offer.[31] Su\u00e1rez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale.[31] The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to \u20ac7.5\u00a0million and Groningen accepted.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Ajax[edit]\n\n\n#### 2007\u201309: Development and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 August 2007 Su\u00e1rez signed a five-year contract with Ajax, for a transfer fee of \u20ac7.5 million,[31][33] and made his club debut in the UEFA Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague.[34] He scored one goal in his Eredivisie debut for the club[35] and two goals in his home debut at the Amsterdam Arena.[36] Ajax finished second in the league table in the 2007\u201308 season[37] and Su\u00e1rez scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances, setting up a blossoming striking partnership with league top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.[38]\n\n\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Ajax head coach Marco van Basten noted how Su\u00e1rez played an important role in many of Ajax's goals, but Van Basten was also upset by the number of yellow cards Su\u00e1rez received.[35] Su\u00e1rez was suspended for one match[39] because he was given his seventh yellow card of the season against Utrecht in a 2\u20130 win.[40] He was also suspended after a half-time altercation with teammate Albert Luque over a free kick.[27][35] Ajax ended the season in third place.[41] Su\u00e1rez scored 22 goals in 31 league matches[35][38] and finished second in scoring tables, one goal behind Mounir El Hamdaoui of AZ.[42] Su\u00e1rez was also named Ajax Player of the Year.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2009\u201310: League top goal scorer, Eredivisie winner[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (with the Ajax pennant) as Ajax captain in 2010.

Ajax suspended him for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount, which the club said they would donate to a \"good cause\".[58] The Dutch daily newspaper *De Telegraaf* branded Su\u00e1rez the \"Cannibal of Ajax\".[12][56] The KNVB increased Su\u00e1rez's suspension to seven league matches.[59] Su\u00e1rez apologized for his actions through a video he uploaded to his Facebook page.[56]\n\n\n\n### Liverpool[edit]\n\n\n#### Transfer[edit]\n\n\nDuring the suspension, Ajax were in contact with other European clubs interested in Su\u00e1rez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a \u20ac26.5\u00a0million (\u00a322.8\u00a0million) offer for Su\u00e1rez from Premier League club Liverpool.[60][61][62] Despite leaving while suspended, Su\u00e1rez departed Ajax on good terms, and he was given a farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club wished he could stay longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed.[63] Ajax ended the 2010\u201311 season as Eredivisie champions[64] and Su\u00e1rez was given a winner's medal[25][65] for his 7 goals in 13 appearances.[66]\n\n\nOn 31 January 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with Liverpool until 2016,[60][67] and was the club's most expensive signing (\u00a322.8\u00a0million) until the arrival of Andy Carroll (\u00a335\u00a0million) a few hours later.[68] Su\u00e1rez requested the number seven shirt, which had been worn by Liverpool legends Kenny Dalglish, his new manager, Kevin Keegan, and Peter Beardsley[69]\n\n\n\n#### 2011\u201312: Early seasons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (left) was signed by Liverpool on the same day as Andy Carroll.\nSu\u00e1rez made his Liverpool debut on 2 February against Stoke City at Anfield in a 2\u20130 win; he came on as a substitute and scored Liverpool's second goal in front of the Kop in the 79th minute.[68][70] He was one of Liverpool's best players during his partial season[71][72] and helped Liverpool go from 12th in the league in mid-January[71] to finish sixth.[73] He finished the 2010\u201311 season with four goals in 13 games.[66]\n\n\nAfter winning the Player of the Tournament at the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica,[74] Su\u00e1rez had a disappointing 2011\u201312 season by his standards.[75] Liverpool finished in eighth place and Su\u00e1rez scored 11 league goals.[75] On 26 February, Liverpool won the League Cup, defeating Cardiff City in a penalty shootout.[76] On 28 April, Su\u00e1rez scored his first Liverpool hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win against Norwich City at Carrow Road.[77] He finished sixth for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Racial abuse incident[edit]\n\n\nThe season was marked by an incident in which Su\u00e1rez was found guilty by a three-man panel from The Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October; he was issued an eight-match suspension and a \u00a340,000 fine.[79] Su\u00e1rez disputed this decision.[80]\n\n\nAfter a 1\u20131 draw against Manchester United on 15 October 2011, Su\u00e1rez was accused of racially abusing Evra,[81] and the FA opened up an investigation into the incident.[81] Su\u00e1rez wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages that he was upset by the accusation and denied the claims.[82] On 16 November, the FA announced it would charge Su\u00e1rez with \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules\", including \"a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra\". Liverpool later released a statement announcing Su\u00e1rez would plead innocent, adding they would \"remain fully supportive\" of him.[83] On 20 December, the FA concluded a seven-day hearing, handing Su\u00e1rez an eight-match ban and a \u00a340,000 fine for racially abusing Evra.[84][85][86]\n\n\nIn their next meeting in February, during the pregame handshakes, Su\u00e1rez avoided shaking Evra's hand, for which Su\u00e1rez and Dalglish were later forced to apologise.[87] Su\u00e1rez was also banned for one match for making an obscene gesture towards Fulham fans.[88]\n\n\n\n#### 2012\u201313: Return and individual success[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 August 2012, Su\u00e1rez signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool.[89] On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the 2012\u201313 season in a 2\u20132 draw with champions Manchester City at Anfield.[90] On 29 September 2012, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick in Liverpool's Premier League fixture away at Norwich City for the second consecutive season.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez playing for Liverpool against Arsenal in January 2013\nOn 6 January 2013, Su\u00e1rez handled the ball before scoring the decisive goal in Liverpool's 2\u20131 win over Mansfield Town from the Conference National in an FA Cup third round match. Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player by claiming \"it's not his job to own up\", while Mansfield manager Paul Cox said he felt \"a little bit gutted\" by the \"instinctive\" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.[92]\n\n\nOn 19 January, Su\u00e1rez scored his seventh goal in three matches against Norwich, as Liverpool cruised to a 5\u20130 home league victory.[93] The following week, Su\u00e1rez captained Liverpool for the first time for the FA Cup fourth round match against Oldham Athletic; Liverpool lost 2\u20133.[94] On 2 March, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic, leading Liverpool to a dominant 4\u20130 victory at the DW Stadium. In so doing, he became only the third Liverpool player to score 20 Premier League goals in a single season after Robbie Fowler and Fernando Torres.[95] On 10 March, Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th goal in all competitions since joining *the Reds* by scoring the opener in a 3\u20132 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ending Spurs' 12-match unbeaten run. He was also named man of the match for his performance after he won the decisive penalty which Steven Gerrard converted.\n\n\nAt the end of the season, Su\u00e1rez was one of six players named on the shortlist for PFA Players' Player of the Year.[96] Su\u00e1rez finished second in the final ballot behind Gareth Bale of Tottenham[97] and was named in the PFA Team of the Year.[97] He was second-top goalscorer in the Premier League for 2012\u201313 with 23 goals and Liverpool's top scorer in all competitions with 30 goals.[98] On 28 May 2013, he was named as Liverpool's player of the season after receiving 64% of votes in a poll of the club's supporters.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez about to score a 35-yard free kick against Zenit Saint Petersburg, his second goal in a 3\u20131 win, March 2013\n#### Second biting incident[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2013, during a 2\u20132 draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield, Su\u00e1rez bit Branislav Ivanovi\u0107; this was the second time Su\u00e1rez had bitten an opponent.[100] It was not noticed by the officials, and Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer in injury time.[13] The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Su\u00e1rez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club.[101] Contrary to claims from Su\u00e1rez, Ivanovi\u0107 did not accept an apology.[101] Su\u00e1rez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence.[102] A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Su\u00e1rez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticized Su\u00e1rez for not appreciating \"the seriousness\" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game \u2013 especially to young players\".[103]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2013, Su\u00e1rez said he would be seeking an exit from Liverpool in the summer, citing excessive media attention on his family as a reason for wanting to leave.[104] On 6 August, after Liverpool had rejected a bid of \u00a340,000,001 for the player from Arsenal, Su\u00e1rez reiterated his wish to leave Liverpool and said Liverpool had previously promised to allow him a transfer if the club failed to qualify for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League.[105] The following day, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool had not broken any promises to Su\u00e1rez and that the player had shown \"total disrespect\" for the club.[106] After this incident, the British press reported that Su\u00e1rez had been instructed to train away from the Liverpool first-team squad by Rodgers.[106][107][108] On 8 August, Liverpool owner John W. Henry stated that Su\u00e1rez would not be allowed to leave the club.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2013\u201314: European Golden Shoe and departure[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 August, Su\u00e1rez reversed his position about wanting to leave the club, with reports stating he wanted to stay at the club and that he was possibly going to sign a contract extension, citing the support from Liverpool supporters as the reason for his unexpected turnaround.[110][111] Su\u00e1rez returned to first-team training two days later after \"offer[ing] contrition\" to his teammates but reportedly not apologizing to his manager.[112] On 25 September, Su\u00e1rez returned to the Liverpool team after his suspension to make his first appearance of the 2013\u201314 season in a League Cup third round tie against Manchester United at Old Trafford, losing 1\u20130.[113][114] On 29 September, Su\u00e1rez made his first Premier League appearance of the season, scoring twice as Liverpool defeated Sunderland 3\u20131 at the Stadium of Light.[115] On 26 October, he scored his fourth Premier League hat-trick, his first at Anfield, in a 4\u20131 defeat of West Bromwich Albion.[116]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"He [Su\u00e1rez] has shown in his time at Liverpool in the last year or so that he is near unplayable.

His second broke a tie in the 80th minute when he dribbled around a defender and curled a \"spectacular shot\"[281] in off the far post; Su\u00e1rez was again named Man of the Match.[281] This win put Uruguay through to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970.[282] In the quarter-final against Ghana, the score was 1\u20131 at the end of regulation and the match went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free-kick into the box, and Su\u00e1rez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line.[283] He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goal bound header with his hands,[284] committing a professional foul[56] to save what would have been the game winner[285] and was sent off. Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar with the ensuing penalty kick[283] and Su\u00e1rez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading down the tunnel.[286][287] Uruguay won the shootout 4\u20132 and advanced to the semi-finals.[283][288]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"The Hand of God now belongs to me. Mine is the real Hand of God.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014After using his hand in the quarter-final against Ghana, Su\u00e1rez referred to Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal against England in 1986.[289]\n\nAfter the match, Su\u00e1rez said, \"I made the save of the tournament.\"[285] He said he had no alternative, was acting out of instinct, and would do it again if it helped his team win.[290] Ghana head coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an \"injustice\"[286] and Su\u00e1rez was labelled a villain and a cheater.[291][290] Others viewed him as a hero.[56][292] Due to the automatic suspension that accompanies a red card, Su\u00e1rez sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance the penalty would be missed, and his team would later win.[27][291]\n\n\nWhile Su\u00e1rez was suspended for the semi-final match for his red card against Ghana,[293] Uruguay \"lacked a second striker [alongside Diego Forl\u00e1n] of cunning and movement\"[294] and lost 3\u20132 to the Netherlands.[295][296] Su\u00e1rez returned for the third place game against Germany; he was booed almost every time he had the ball because of his handball in the Ghana match.[297] He assisted Cavani on Uruguay's first goal,[298] but Uruguay lost 3\u20132.[297] During the tournament, Su\u00e1rez played 543 minutes in six appearances and scored three goals.[299]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez was named most valuable player of the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica\nIn the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Su\u00e1rez scored in Uruguay's opening game, a 1\u20131 draw with Peru.[300] In their next game, he provided the assist for Alvaro Pereira's goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Chile.[301] Uruguay finished second in their group and advanced to the knockout round[302] with a win, 1\u20130 against Mexico, and two draws, against Peru and Chile.[303] In the quarter-finals, Uruguay drew with tournament hosts Argentina 1\u20131 after regulation and extra time. Uruguay won the shootout 5\u20134 and Su\u00e1rez converted his penalty.[304][305] Su\u00e1rez scored both goals in Uruguay's 2\u20130 semi-final win over Peru and was named Man of the Match.[306] In the final, Su\u00e1rez scored the opening goal and set up Diego Forlan's second goal as Uruguay defeated Paraguay 3\u20130 for their record 15th Copa Am\u00e9rica title.[307][308] Su\u00e1rez scored four goals and provided two assists during the tournament and was named MVP of the Tournament.[307][43][309]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 July 2012, Su\u00e1rez was selected for the Uruguay Olympic football team alongside Liverpool teammate Sebasti\u00e1n Coates to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games.[310] In the first pre-tournament warm-up game against Chile on 11 July, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick for Uruguay as they came from 0\u20132 down to win 6\u20134 in a thrilling match.[311]\n\n\nAs one of Uruguay's three overage players, Su\u00e1rez was named as captain for the Olympic Games.[312] After an opening win over the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay were defeated by Senegal and Great Britain and eliminated at the first round. Su\u00e1rez failed to score during the tournament.\n\n\n\n### 2013 Confederations Cup[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was selected in the Uruguay squad to play in Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup. He scored a curling free-kick from 30 yards (27\u00a0m) in a 2\u20131 defeat to Spain in their opening match at Recife on 16 June.[313] He then scored twice after appearing as a substitute in Uruguay's 8\u20130 win over Tahiti, making him the Uruguay national team's all-time top-goalscorer with 35 goals, surpassing his teammate Diego Forl\u00e1n.[314] Uruguay were eventually eliminated in the semi-finals, losing 2\u20131 to Brazil in Belo Horizonte.[315]\n\n\n\n### 2014 FIFA World Cup, third biting incident[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez (middle) celebrating one of his two goals against England at the 2014 World Cup\nSu\u00e1rez ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the South American section with 11 goals in 14 matches.[316] In November 2013, Uruguay defeated Jordan 5\u20130 on aggregate in an intercontinental play-off to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.[317]\n\n\nOn 22 May, Su\u00e1rez underwent emergency surgery on his left knee. He was confined to a wheelchair for a time, leading to rumours he would be unable to participate in the World Cup.[318][319][320] He was named as a substitute for Uruguay's first match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Costa Rica, but did not play in the match. Su\u00e1rez started Uruguay's second match against England and scored both of the team's goals in a 2\u20131 win at the Arena Corinthians in S\u00e3o Paulo.[321]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"These are just things that happen out on the pitch.

I apologize to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be another incident like [this].\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Su\u00e1rez on 30 June 2014.[324]\n\nFor Uruguay's final group match against Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the knockout stage while Italy only needed a draw.[325] Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0\u20130, Su\u00e1rez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Su\u00e1rez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Su\u00e1rez falling and clutching his face.[14][326] The controversial incident made headline news around the world.[327] As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez for not penalizing Su\u00e1rez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1\u20130 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.[14][326][328]\n\n\nTwo days later, on 26 June, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, banned Su\u00e1rez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup.[145][329] He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000.[145][329] The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Su\u00e1rez's defense that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was \"deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilizing him\". The severity of the penalty was due to the fact it was Su\u00e1rez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse.[323] Soon after the suspension was announced, online gambling firm 888poker cancelled its sponsorship deal with Su\u00e1rez.[330] With Su\u00e1rez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 0\u20132 to Colombia and were eliminated from the World Cup.[331]\n\n\nOn the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal the suspension.[332] Su\u00e1rez's lawyer said that \"we don't have any doubts\" of a European-based campaign against Su\u00e1rez.[333] Various Uruguayan individuals defended Su\u00e1rez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticized the severity of his ban, including President of Uruguay Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who labelled the ban \"fascist\" and called FIFA \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\";[334][335] AUF president Wilmar Valdez;[332] Uruguay captain Diego Lugano;[336] and Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest of the ban.[337] The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood.[338] For non-Uruguayan parties, Chiellini, who was bitten, called the ban \"excessive\", while international players' union FIFPro called for Su\u00e1rez to \"receive all the support he needs\" and that the \"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\" of Su\u00e1rez.[337]\n\n\nSix days after the incident, on 30 June, Su\u00e1rez apologized to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini.[324][339] Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Su\u00e1rez's suspension.[339][340]\n\n\nOn 3 July, the AUF appealed Su\u00e1rez's ban,[341] but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July.[342][343] With Su\u00e1rez's ban not preventing him from transferring to another club,[344] it was announced on 11 July that Su\u00e1rez had agreed to move to Barcelona.[345][346][347] Days before the transfer, Su\u00e1rez's apology to Chiellini had been praised by various Barcelona club individuals. Barcelona club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \"honorable\", sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Su\u00e1rez as being \"humble enough to admit an error\" while new signing Ivan Rakiti\u0107 commended Su\u00e1rez's \"character and strength\".[348][349]\n\n\n\n### Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario and 2018 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez playing against Portugal in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup\nOn 25 March 2016, after over a year of international absence for Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer against Brazil in Recife for a 2\u20132 draw in the qualification process for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[350] Su\u00e1rez was included in Uruguay's 23-man squad for the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, although a hamstring injury sustained in the Copa del Rey final on 22 May put his place in the team in jeopardy.[180][179] Although he remained in the squad, he missed both of his national side's opening group losses to Mexico and Venezuela, which resulted in a first-round elimination from the tournament.[351] He was once again left on the substitutes' bench in Uruguay's final 3\u20130 group win over Jamaica on 13 June.[352]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez scored twice on 10 October 2017 as Uruguay won 4\u20132 at home to Bolivia in their final World Cup qualifying match, thus securing their place for the tournament in Russia, as well as becoming the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Argentina's Lionel Messi, overtaking the previous record which was held by Hern\u00e1n Crespo.[353][354] In March, Uruguay won the 2018 China Cup, and Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th international goal with a penalty against the Czech Republic in the semi-finals, winning it himself when fouled by goalkeeper Ji\u0159\u00ed Pavlenka.[355] He won his 100th cap on 20 June 2018 in Uruguay's second group match at the World Cup, scoring the only goal against Saudi Arabia at the Rostov Arena in Rostov-on-Don to advance the nation into the last 16, for which Su\u00e1rez was given man of the match.[356] In the final group game on 25 June, Su\u00e1rez was again named the man of the match as he scored Uruguay's opener with a free kick into the bottom corner in a 3\u20130 win over hosts Russia.[357] In the Round of 16 match against Portugal on 30 June, he set-up Cavani's opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 victory.[358] Uruguay were eliminated from the tournament following a 2\u20130 defeat to France in the quarter-finals on 6 July.[359]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u20132020: Qualifiers and Copa Am\u00e9rica upset[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, manager Tab\u00e1rez included Su\u00e1rez in the final 23-man Uruguay squad for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[360] On 16 June, he scored the third goal in a 4\u20130 win over Ecuador in the team's opening group match of the tournament, also setting up the opener scored by Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro.[361]\n\n\nIn the quarter-finals against Peru on 29 June, he had a goal disallowed by VAR for offside, and was subsequently the only player to miss his spot-kick in the resulting penalty shoot-out, following a 0\u20130 draw after regulation time, which saw Uruguay eliminated from the competition.[362]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2020, Su\u00e1rez scored the first goal of the South American 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, becoming the first player ever to score the opening goal three times (after his 2010 and 2014 strikes) in the competition's history.[363]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present: Copa Am\u00e9rica and 2022 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 June 2021, Su\u00e1rez scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Chile in Uruguay's second group match of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.[364] However, Uruguay lost against Colombia in the quarter-finals on penalties after a goalless draw.[365]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2022, in Uruguay's final group match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar against Ghana, Su\u00e1rez assisted Giorgian de Arrascaeta's second goal of the match to give Uruguay a 2\u20130 win; however, group rivals South Korea scored a late goal to win 2\u20131 against Portugal, advancing from the group stage having scored four goals to Uruguay\u2019s two (both teams were tied at 4 points and a 0 goal difference).[366]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Su\u00e1rez in action for Liverpool takes on Sylvain Distin of Everton during the Merseyside Derby in 2012\nSu\u00e1rez creates goal scoring chances with his powerful shot, and has \"remarkable technical ability\" according to his FIFA profile.[367] Known for his direct running at players, Su\u00e1rez has a particular penchant for nutmegging opponents (putting the ball through their legs).[368] Liverpool fans (accompanied with a banner) used to say he was so good, \"he could nutmeg a mermaid\".[369] Often regarded by many as one of the best strikers of all time,[note 3] Su\u00e1rez is a prolific goal scorer, having the rare distinction of being the leading scorer in three top-flight European leagues, a feat only matched by Ruud van Nistelrooy[376] and Cristiano Ronaldo.[377] An accurate finisher[378] with either foot,[379] despite being naturally right-footed,[380] he is capable of scoring from both inside[381] and outside the penalty area.[382]\n\n\nHarry Redknapp said that Su\u00e1rez could play anywhere \u2013 as the target man or behind as a second striker. Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez called Su\u00e1rez \"a great forward, an elite player among forwards in the world\",[383] and Liverpool coach Kenny Dalglish said, \"he's intelligent, he's had a fantastic education at Ajax\".[384] Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said his abilities allow him to get into a position to score and evade defenders.[385][386] Meanwhile, Thierry Henry called Su\u00e1rez the best striker in the world, stating, \"He has everything. He's in your face, he's arrogant- in a good way, he can volley it, he can score headers. He has vicious side to his game and I will not call it cheating. He knows how to score goals.\"[387]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been praised for his work rate,[385] movement,[388] and his quickness[384] that allows him to attack from the outside;[367] as such he occasionally played as an inverted winger on the left flank during his time with Ajax.[389] Additionally, Su\u00e1rez has a liking for often executing dummies (going around the defenders with a fake-out) within his style of dribbling.[390] During his time in Barcelona, he was known for constantly scoring through volleys or half-volleys.[391][392] Su\u00e1rez also gained a reputation for consistently scoring acrobatic goals, often shooting off balance, or in air, or with overhead bicycle kicks.[393][394][395] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick taker,[396] and has also been known to take penalties.[397]\n\n\nHe also creates many scoring opportunities for his teammates with his vision and great passing abilities, as is reflected in his numbers of assists, among the very highest within the stat's recorded history.[398] Former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, lauded Su\u00e1rez's unselfish playstyle within his autobiography, stating how that \"It's a rare combination, to be a miraculous footballer who is willing to use his gifts to selflessly assist and create goals for a teammate\", as well as further writing, \"He scores goals. He creates goals. He's hard and horrible to play against. You've got a chance of beating anyone in the world with Luis Su\u00e1rez in your team\".[399][400]\n\n\nIn addition to being a prolific player, Su\u00e1rez has often been praised for his strong mentality and desire to win. Former Liverpool teammate, Jordan Henderson dubbed Su\u00e1rez as a \"warrior\", claiming that his attitude inspired confidence among his teammates.[401] Meanwhile, Gerrard eulogized his drive to succeed, stating \"Luis played to win a five-a-side training session like he was chasing the Champions League or the World Cup. If his team lost a kickaround he went home angry; he always needed to win that badly\".[400] Atletico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone hailed Su\u00e1rez for the \"desire and energy\" he brought to the club.[402] Su\u00e1rez, himself, has stated that he's the kind of player who would \"kill himself just to prevent a throw-in at the 90th minute.\" in his autobiography.[403]\n\n\nFormer Ajax coach Marco van Basten criticized Su\u00e1rez for his tendency to receive yellow cards.[35] Van Basten said he had a tense relationship with Su\u00e1rez,[35] although he conceded that \"Luis is unpredictable, he's hard to influence but that makes him special.\"[35] At times, Su\u00e1rez can be dominant but fail to convert his efforts into goals.[404] Despite his weaknesses, Su\u00e1rez's leadership stood out to Ajax management.[60]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez has been widely accused of diving.[note 4] His manager, teammates and various analysts have commented that this reputation for simulation has caused referees not to award him legitimate penalties.[408][409] In January 2013, Su\u00e1rez admitted to diving against Stoke City in an October 2012 match. This led his manager Brendan Rodgers to comment his actions were \"unacceptable\" and that he would be dealt with \"internally\" by the club.[410] During the 2018 World Cup game against Portugal, after collisions with Portuguese players, Suarez twice acted like he had a head injury despite his head having been untouched.[411]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez is infamous for biting opponents on multiple occasions. In a Group D matchup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Suarez was shown to have bitten Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, resulting in FIFA suspending Suarez from all football activities for 4 months. While playing for Liverpool, Suarez bit Chelsea player Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 in a Premier League match, and was punished with a ten match ban. In an earlier incident while playing for AFC Ajax he was caught biting PSV Eindhoven player Otman Bakkal and was suspended for seven games.[100] Su\u00e1rez has also been accused of stamping on opponents in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League.[412][413][414][415]\n\n\nDue to his diving, biting, stamping, and other antics, Su\u00e1rez has been frequently labelled as a pest and a cheat.[416] In December 2013, Spanish football website *El Gol Digital* ranked Su\u00e1rez at fifth in its list of the world's dirtiest footballers.[417]\n\n\n\n## Media and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Previously with Adidas, Su\u00e1rez has been sponsored by Puma since 2018. He wears Puma Future 2.1.\nSu\u00e1rez had a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas, before switching to rivals Puma in 2018.[418] Su\u00e1rez starred in a 2014 advert for Beats with other global football stars including Neymar and Thierry Henry, with the theme of \"The Game Before the Game\" and the players' pre-game ritual of listening to music.[419] In Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez has also appeared in advertisements for Abitab, Antel, Cablevisi\u00f3n, Garnier, Pepsi and Samsung.[420][421]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez features in EA Sports' *FIFA* video game series: as a result of Su\u00e1rez's ban for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup, players in *FIFA 15* were unable to select Su\u00e1rez until his ban ended on 26 October.[422]\n\n\nActive on social media, Su\u00e1rez has over 40 million Instagram followers as of May 2020, the most for a person from Uruguay.[423][424]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez was born in Salto, Uruguay to Sandra Diaz and Rodolfo Su\u00e1rez, the fourth of seven boys.[27][425] His older brother, Paolo Su\u00e1rez, is a retired professional footballer, who last played for Isidro Metap\u00e1n in El Salvador.\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez moved with his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.[425] In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,[24][425] while also taking up work as a street sweeper at the age of 15.[23] In 1998, aged 11 he appeared as a contestant on children's game show *Aventujuegos*, with his team winning: his episode was brought up in a 2011 episode of chat show *Noche de Locura* and he was surprised the footage had been kept.[3]\n\n\nThe contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.[23] Besides his native tongue, Su\u00e1rez is able to speak Dutch and English.[426][427]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mural of Su\u00e1rez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay\nSu\u00e1rez is of mixed race and has a black grandfather.[428] The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the Patrice Evra incident, where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of \"*mi negrito*\" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Su\u00e1rez's repeated use of \"negro\" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable, issuing him an eight-match ban. His mother also supported the claim Su\u00e1rez made that using the word was not racist in Uruguay. She said it was \"normal\", and that it was \"a word people use with their friends. It's like calling someone fat, thin or whatever.\"[429]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez began dating Sof\u00eda Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to Barcelona in 2003, and Su\u00e1rez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sof\u00eda again.[23] Su\u00e1rez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter named Delfina (born 2010) [430]and two sons named Benjamin (born 2013) and Lauti (born 2018).[431][27][432] He has a tattoo of his daughter's name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his goal celebration \u2013 this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports\u2019 video game *FIFA 15* as \"Kiss The Wrist\".[433][434] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer to Sof\u00eda's family. On the move, Su\u00e1rez said, \"[Liverpool] did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right.\"[435] In 2014, Su\u00e1rez released his autobiography, *Crossing the Line \u2013 My Story*.[436][437]\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez, who is married to an Italian citizen, was eligible to take a B1 Italian Language exam and flew to Perugia in September 2020 to take the test and gain Italian citizenship. Though obtaining the results of the language exam and approval of citizenship takes several months and several years respectively to be processed, Su\u00e1rez reportedly got his language exam results within hours and would have his citizenship approved in several weeks. The Italian media had noted that this led to accusations of special treatment against Su\u00e1rez, especially as Italian laws had been changed in 2018 to make obtaining citizenship by marriage more difficult.[438] In September 2020, an investigation was launched over accusations that he had cheated his way into gaining Italian citizenship.[234]\n\n\nIt is known that Su\u00e1rez has used his experience and knowledge to mentor new Uruguayan footballing talents, most notably Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.[439]\n\n\n\n### Pandora Papers[edit]\n\n\nHe is among the 13 sports personalities mentioned

He later coached Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 187 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Su\u00e1rez, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, C\u00e9sar, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the *midfield general* role and was nicknamed *Surrealista* (*The Surrealist*) and *Home Magosta* (*The Grasshopper Man*)[3] due to his style.\n\n\nAs a manager, he led Barcelona to a title in La Liga in 1945, and as a scout he recruited another Barcelona legend, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala. However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di St\u00e9fano affair,[3] twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco,[3] Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona.[*citation needed*] When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Samitier played as a junior for FC Internacional before, at the age of 17, he made his debut for FC Barcelona in 1919. As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqu\u00e9s, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dal\u00ed. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928.\n\n\n\n### Madrid CF[edit]\n\n\nIn 1933 an aging Samiter found himself in dispute with the FC Barcelona management and he was dropped from the first team. Real Madrid, then known as *Madrid CF*, were quick to take advantage of the situation. Samitier was reunited with both his friend Ricardo Zamora and then Francisco Bru. Although his career with the Madrid club was short, he did help them win a title in La Liga 1932\u201333 and the Copa de Espa\u00f1a in 1934.\n\n\n\n### Samitier Tribute[edit]\n\n\nThe tribute match to Samitier was held on 13 May 1934 at Estadio Chamart\u00edn in Madrid, between Madrid FC and Espanyol, and Samitier scored both the first and the last goals of an 8\u20132 win. Other Madrid goalscorers include the likes of Eugenio, Hilario, Luis Regueiro and Lazcano, while Jos\u00e9 Padr\u00f3n scored one of Espanyol's consolation goals.\n\n\n**Madrid**: Zamora (Cayol 45\u00b4); Quesada, Maci\u00e1, P. Regueiro (Sauto), Bonet, Gurruchaga, (Valle 45\u00b4), Lazcano, L. Regueiro (Olivares 45\u00b4) Samitier, Hilario and Eugenio.\n\n\n**Espanyol**: Martorell (Eizaguirre 45\u00b4); Mas, P\u00e9rez, Cifuentes, Sol\u00e9 (Antero 45\u00b4), Cristi\u00e0, Prats, Edelmiro, Iriondo, Padr\u00f3n and Bosch.\n\n\n\n### Exile in France[edit]\n\n\nIn 1936 Samitier made a brief start to his career as a coach. He succeeded Fred Pentland at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the middle of the season, but failed to prevent them from being relegated. However, Samitier's new career and Atl\u00e9tico's relegation were postponed with the start of the Spanish Civil War. He found himself arrested by an anarchist militia, but was eventually released and left for France on a warship. His *escape* was later used by the Nationalist side in an account printed in *Marca*. In October 1936 he joined OGC Nice as a player, where he was reunited once again with Ricardo Zamora. He subsequently scored 21 goals in 48 matches for the French team.[5] He eventually retired as a player in 1939 and was briefly coach at OGC Nice in 1942.\n\n\n\n### Return to Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nSamitier returned to Spain and became manager of CF Barcelona in 1944. In 1945 he guided them to only their second ever La Liga title. Then they beat the Copa del General\u00edsimo winners Atl\u00e9tico Bilbao to win the Copa de Oro Argentina. Samitier subsequently worked as the clubs *chief scout* and was instrumental in the recruitment of another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1950 Kubala arrived in Spain with his own team, *Hungaria*. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. They played a series of friendlies against a *Madrid Select XI*, a Spain XI and RCD Espa\u00f1ol. During these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Samitier. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was then persuaded by Samitier to sign for CF Barcelona. It has been suggested that Samitier used his connections within Francoist Spain to help arrange the transfer. In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used by Francoist Spain and was made into a film *The Stars Search for Peace* which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1920, together with Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga, Pichichi and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Belauste, Samitier was a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games.[6] He subsequently made 21 appearances and scored 2 goals for Spain.[1]\n\n\nSamitier also played 26 games and scored at least 20 goals for the Catalan XI.[*citation needed*] However, records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played and scored more. Together with Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, Sagibarba and Zamora, he helped the Catalan XI win the Prince of Asturias Cup twice in the 1920s, winning the inter-regional competition in 1923\u201324 and 1926. In the 1924 final, he scored twice in a 4\u20134 draw against Castile/Madrid XI and scored again in the replay as the Catalan team won 3\u20132.[7] Catalonia faced Czechoslovakia twice in 1925 and 1926, and Samitier managed to score in both games, a 2\u20131 win and a 2\u20131 defeat, respecteviely.[8][9] His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 19 January 1936 at the *Les Corts*.
