Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7\u00a0billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3\u00a0billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules\u2014especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year\u2014and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000\u2013100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000\u2013800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000\u201322,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Pincus-Roth, Zachary (January 8, 2006). \"Movies aren't the only B.O. monsters\". *Variety*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hall & Neale 2010, pp.\u00a06\u20137. \"For similar reasons of accountability, *Variety* has typically used figures for domestic (U.S. and Canadian) rather than worldwide revenue. This became its standard policy in 1940, when the advent of war in Europe persuaded the American film industry (temporarily, as it turned out) that it should be wholly reliant on the home market for profitability. Where specific rentals data are reported in *Variety* before this (which tended to be only sporadically) they were often for worldwide rather domestic performance. This was also the case with other trade sources, such as *Quigley*'s annual *Motion Picture Almanac*, which published its own all-time hits lists from the early 1930s onward. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939\u20131942 release (roadshow/\u200bgeneral release/\u200bsecond-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry\u2014after it took back the record\u2014includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The New Mutants* (2020) | $49,169,594\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 11\n | *Jurassic Park* | $6,006,943,987\n | 6\n | $1,001,157,331\n | *Jurassic World* ($1,671,537,444)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Jurassic World* trilogy | $3,981,988,949\n | 3\n | $1,327,329,650\n | *Jurassic World* ($1,671,537,444)\n |\n| 1\n | *Jurassic World* (2015) | $1,671,537,444 |\n| 2\n | *Fallen Kingdom* (2018) | $1,308,473,425 |\n| 3\n | *Dominion* (2022) | $1,001,978,080\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Jurassic Park* trilogy | $2,024,955,038\n | 3\n | $674,985,013\n | *Jurassic Park* ($1,037,535,230)\n |\n| 1\n | *Jurassic Park* (1993) | $1,037,535,230 |\n| 2\n | *The Lost World* (1997) | $618,638,999 |\n| 3\n | *Jurassic Park III* (2001) | $368,780,809\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1989 | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | $474,171,806\u2013494,000,000 | $36,000,000\u201355,400,000 | [# 283][# 274][# 284] |\n| 1990 | *Ghost* | $505,870,681 ($505,702,588)\n | $22,000,000 | [# 285][# 274] |\n| 1991 | *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* | $523,774,456 ($519,843,345)\n | $94,000,000 | [# 286][# 287] |\n| 1992 | *Aladdin* | $504,050,219 | $28,000,000 | [# 288][# 146] |\n| 1993 | *Jurassic Park* | $1,037,535,230 ($912,667,947)\n | $63,000,000\u201370,000,000 | [# 73] |\n| 1994 | *The Lion King* | $968,511,805 ($763,455,561)\n | $45,000,000\u201379,300,000 | [# 289] |\n| 1995 | *Toy Story* | $373,554,033 ($364,873,776)\n | $30,000,000 | [# 290][# 291] |\n| *Die Hard with a Vengeance* | $366,101,666 | $70,000,000 | [# 292][# 293] |\n| 1996 | *Independence Day* | $817,400,891 | $75,000,000 | [# 294] |\n| 1997 | *Titanic* | $2,257,844,554 ($1,843,373,318)\n | $200,000,000 | [# 7] |\n| 1998 | *Armageddon* | $553,709,788 | $140,000,000 | [# 295][# 296] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFHSome sources such as The Numbers state that *Aloma of the South Seas* is the highest grossing film of the year, earning $3\u00a0million.[54] However, no contemporary sources provide figures for *Aloma of the South Seas*, so it is unclear what the $3\u00a0million figure relates to. If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide. Other sources put its earnings at $2\u00a0million,[55] which may suggest the higher figure is the worldwide rental, given the confusion over international figures during this period.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Pre-2020 releases: \"Titanic (1997)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Distributor rentals: It is also important to know and recognize the difference between the distributor's gross receipts and the gross rentals. The term \"rentals\" refers to the aggregate amount of the film distributor's share of monies paid at theatre box offices computed on the basis of negotiated agreements between the distributor and the exhibitor. Note that gross receipts refers to amounts actually received and from all markets and media, whereas gross rentals refers to amounts earned from theatrical exhibition only, regardless of whether received by the distributor.

Keats claimed the picture cost $4\u00a0million to make and that it earned twice that much within twenty years. The production cost estimate is probably correct. Hughes worked on the picture for over two years, shooting it first as a silent and then as a talkie. Lewis Milestone said that in between Hughes experimented with shooting it in color as well.

It is the sequel to *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) and *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017), and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Will Poulter, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Linda Cardellini, Nathan Fillion, and Sylvester Stallone. In the film, the Guardians must protect Rocket (Cooper) from the High Evolutionary (Iwuji).\n\n\nGunn stated in November 2014 that he had initial ideas for a third and final film in the series, and announced his return to write and direct in April 2017. Disney fired him from the film in July 2018 following the resurfacing of controversial posts on Twitter, but the studio reversed course by that October and reinstated him. Gunn's return was publicly revealed in March 2019, with production resuming after he completed work for DC on *The Suicide Squad* (2021) and the first season of its spin-off series *Peacemaker* (2022). Filming began in November 2021 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and lasted until May 2022.\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 5, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. Like its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success. Critics praised the film for Gunn's direction and screenplay, its visuals, soundtrack, performances, action sequences, emotional weight and humor; many deemed the film as a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It grossed over $845\u00a0million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nAt their new headquarters on Knowhere,[a] the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam Warlock, a Sovereign warrior created by High Priestess Ayesha, who seeks to destroy them for stealing from her.[b] After critically wounding Rocket, Adam is stabbed by Nebula, and flees. The Guardians' med-packs are useless at healing Rocket's wounds, who has a kill switch embedded in him by Orgocorp, a company helmed by the High Evolutionary, Rocket's creator. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life.\n\n\nAs Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. As a baby, he was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth. Rocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's growing intelligence but became furious once it exceeded his own. The High Evolutionary used Rocket to perfect his Humanimal creations, then planned to harvest Rocket's brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89. Rocket freed his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor in the ensuing firefight. Rocket eventually fled Counter-Earth in a spaceship.\n\n\nIn the present, the Ravagers, including an alternate version of Gamora,[c] help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors. The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket. The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the Ar\u00eate Laboratories complex. Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket as Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to Ar\u00eate. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards as Quill and Groot enter Ar\u00eate, while Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group. Gamora saves Rocket from being captured by Adam and the High Evolutionary's guard War Pig.\n\n\nQuestioned by Quill, the High Evolutionary admits disillusionment with Counter-Earth\u2019s imperfect society, so he destroys the planet, killing the Humanimals as well as Ayesha. Ar\u00eate departs as a spaceship, with Nebula, Drax and Mantis boarding to rescue Quill and Groot, who instead escape Ar\u00eate with Theel, who they kill, before retrieving the code from his corpse and being rescued by Gamora in their ship. As Quill's group uses the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience, in which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. He learns from Lylla that his time has not yet come, as Quill uses the code to disable the kill switch and restart Rocket's heart.\n\n\nDrax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter several genetically modified humanoid children on Ar\u00eate before being captured. The other Guardians stage a rescue mission, leading to a battle against the High Evolutionary's forces. Kraglin fires on Ar\u00eate with Knowhere, dooming Ar\u00eate, then helps to save Knowhere's citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutiny only to be killed by their leader. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with Quill's group. The Guardians delay leaving Ar\u00eate, choosing to rescue the Star Children, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo's telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being confronted by the High Evolutionary, who the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary,[d] and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over, but is saved by Adam, who had a change of heart when Groot saved him from Ar\u00eate.\n\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill decides to leave the Guardians, naming Rocket as Captain, and travels to Earth to reunite with Jason, his grandfather. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora reunites with the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued Star Children), and Adam's pet Blurp, take on a new mission. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord:  \nThe half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers, the Ravagers.[6] In the film, Quill is in a \"state of depression\" following the appearance of a variant of his dead lover Gamora, who does not share the same affection for Quill as her older version had for him, which in turn affects his leadership of the Guardians.[7]\n* Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora:  \nAn orphan who seeks redemption for her past crimes, and was adopted and trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin.[6] The original version of Gamora, a member of the Guardians, was killed by Thanos in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and an alternate version of the character traveled to the present in *Avengers: Endgame* (2019); Salda\u00f1a reprises the latter role in this film,[8][9] now serving as a member of the Ravagers.[10] Salda\u00f1a stated that *Vol. 3* would be the final time she would portray Gamora, noting that she originally signed to play her in one film and ended up playing the role for much longer, a role she was grateful to play due to the impact it especially had on female fans.[11]\n* Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer:  \nA member of the Guardians and a highly skilled warrior whose family was slaughtered by Ronan the Accuser, under the instructions of Thanos.[6] Bautista stated that *Vol. 3* would be the final time he would portray Drax, having been grateful for the role, while still calling it a \"relief\" to have concluded his time with the character, given the long hours needed to get into makeup and hoping to pursue more dramatic acting roles.[12] Because of Bautista's decision, Gunn opted not to include Drax in the post-credits scene.[13]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:  \nA member of the Guardians, a former Avenger, and Gamora's adoptive sister who, similarly to her, was trained by their adoptive father Thanos to be his personal assassin.[14] Gillan believed Nebula was developing into a \"slightly different person\" with more levity as she starts to heal psychologically following the death of Thanos, who was the source of her abuse and torment.[15] *Vol. 3* fulfills a character arc for the character writer and director James Gunn envisioned when starting work on *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014), going from a minor villain to a member of the Guardians.[16] Although the film teases a possible romance between Star-Lord and Nebula, Gunn denies having ever considered the two becoming a couple, though Gillan does believe she harbors a small crush on Quill.[13]\n* Pom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians with empathic powers, and Quill's half-sister.[17]\n* Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot: A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket.[6] Austin Freeman provided the motion-capture for Groot.\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:  \nA member of the Guardians and a former Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter and a master of weapons and military tactics.[6] Gunn said that the film tells Rocket's story, including his background and \"where he's going\", along with how that ties into the other Guardians and the end of this iteration of the team.[18] The film completes a character arc that was established in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017), and continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[19] Sean Gunn once again provided on set motion capture for the character, while also voicing young Rocket.[20] Cooper also voiced adolescent Rocket while Noah Raskin voiced baby Rocket.[21]\n* Will Poulter as Adam Warlock:  \nA powerful artificial being created by the Sovereign to destroy the Guardians.[22] Given Warlock is newly born from the Sovereign's cocoon, he is \"basically a baby\" that \"does not understand life very well\".[23] Poulter believed there was \"a lot of comedy\" in someone just entering the world for the first time and \"trying to develop his moral compass\", while also having \"some genuine pathos\".[7] Gunn thought Warlock's interactions with the Guardians provided \"an interesting juxtaposition\" to what their journey has been, and described him as a more traditional superhero compared to the Guardians, although not necessarily a hero.[24]\n* Sean Gunn as Kraglin: A member of the Guardians and Yondu Udonta's former second-in-command in the Ravagers.[25]\n* Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary:  \nAn alien cyborg scientist and CEO of OrgoCorp specializing in creating hybrid creatures and Rocket's creator, seeking to forcibly enhance all living beings into a \"special race\" where he has been credited as creating the Animen, the Humanimals, the Hell Spawn, the Sovereign, the Xeronians, and the Star Children.[7][26][27] Iwuji described the character as \"narcissistic, sociopathic, but very charming\", adding that there was \"something very Shakespearean about him, there's something very emotionally dark about him, and he's a lot of fun on top of all that\".[28] In preparation for the role, Iwuji listened to his character's taste for classical music in contrast to the American rock and pop music songs played in the film, allowing Iwuji to go back to his favorite arias and operas, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's *The Marriage of Figaro* (1786) and *Don Giovanni* (1787).[29] Gunn likened the High Evolutionary to \"a space version\" of Doctor Moreau from *Island of Lost Souls* (1932), a film Gunn is a big fan of, calling him \"a detestable character\".[7] When asked by Rachel Lindsay of *Extra* about the character, Gunn referred to the High Evolutionary as the \"cruelest MCU villain\" to date the franchise has ever seen due to how he negatively impacts on the lives of Rocket and his fellow subject friends,[30] while Iwuji made sure along with Gunn to avoid giving the Evolutionary, at least intentionally, any sympathy unlike previous villains like Thanos or Killmonger, focusing under Gunn's orders on commenting in the character's single mindedness, narcissistic and zealous personality like the \"most horrific\" figures in history have been shown to be.[31]\n* Linda Cardellini as Lylla: An anthropomorphic otter who is an associate and friend of Rocket.[32] Cardellini provided both the voice and motion capture for Lylla, having previously played Laura Barton in past MCU media.[33][34]\n* Nathan Fillion as Master Karja: An orgosentry at Orgocorp.[35][36]\n* Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord: A high-ranking Ravager.[37]\n\n\nReprising their respective roles from previous *Guardians* films and/or *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* (2022) are Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, the golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people who had Adam Warlock created to destroy the Guardians;[38] Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, a high-ranking Ravager;[39] Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck;[40] Christopher Fairbank as the Broker;[40] Stephen Blackehart and Rhett Miller as Steemie and Bzermikitokolok, two denizens of Knowhere;[41][42] Gregg Henry as Quill's grandfather Jason;[43] and Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, the former head of the Ravagers and Peter's deceased mentor.[40] Maria Bakalova reprises her voice and motion capture role from the *Holiday Special* as Cosmo,[44][45] a member of the Guardians who is a sapient dog that developed psionic abilities after being abandoned in outer space by the Soviet Union.[46] Gunn changed Cosmo's gender from male, as depicted in the comics, to female for the film, as a tribute to the character's original inspiration, Laika, a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space.[47] Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Slate,[45] after also doing so for the *Holiday Special*,[48] and was previously portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two *Guardians* films.[49][50] Tara Strong (who voiced Miss Minutes in the Disney+ series *Loki*) voices Mainframe who was previously voiced by an uncredited Miley Cyrus in *Vol. 2*.[51][52] Jared Gore provides motion capture for Krugarr, a Ravager who wields sorcery powers and speaks through his sorcery.[53]\n\n\nAsim Chaudhry voices Teefs, an anthropomorphic walrus; Mikaela Hoover (who played Nova Prime's assistant in the first film) voices Floor, an anthropomorphic rabbit;[34] Daniela Melchior appears as Ura,[38][54] the receptionist at Orgocorp;[40] Miriam Shor and Nico Santos appear as Recorder Vim and Recorder Theel, respectively,[55] the scientifically-minded henchmen of the High Evolutionary;[56] Jennifer Holland appears as Administrator Kwol,[57] a security employee of Orgocorp;[40] Kai Zen appears as Phyla, one of the High Evolutionary's Star Child prisoners;[58] Judy Greer (who played Maggie Lang in the first two *Ant-Man* films) voices War Pig, a cyborg pig and member of the Hell Spawns working for the High Evolutionary;[59] Reinaldo Faberlle voices Behemoth, a cyborg bird and member of the Hell Spawns who also works for the High Evolutionary;[60] Dee Bradley Baker voices Blurp,[61] a furry F'saki that is an unnamed Ravager's pet;[62][63] and Dane DiLiegro appears as an Humanimal octopus drug dealer on Counter-Earth (credited as \"Unsavory Octopus\").[64]\n\n\nCameos in the film include Lloyd Kaufman as Gridlemop, a Krylorian on Knowhere who partakes in a card game with Kraglin; Pete Davidson as Phlektik, a guard at Ar\u00eate Laboratories;[65][66] and writer and director James Gunn as the voice of Lambshank, a deformed experiment of the High Evolutionary that is among those freed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[67]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial work[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) writer and director James Gunn stated in November 2014 that, in addition to having the \"basic story\" for *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017) while working on the first film, he also had ideas for a potential third film.[68] Despite this, he was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third *Guardians* film, saying that it would depend on how he felt after making *Vol. 2*.[69] In April 2016, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, the producer of the *Guardians* films, said a third film was planned for the franchise as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in \"2020 and beyond\".[70] In March 2017, Gunn said there would be a third film \"for sure. We're trying to figure it out\",[71] soon adding that there were no specific plans for the film yet, but that Marvel would want to make it \"unless something goes horribly\u2014which is always possible, you never know\".[72] He also reiterated that he had not decided whether he would be directing the film, and that he was going to figure out his involvement and his next project \"over the next couple of weeks\".[71] Part of Gunn's reluctance to return to the franchise came from not wanting to work on it without Michael Rooker, whose character from the first two films, Yondu Udonta, died at the end of *Vol. 2*.[73]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula\u2014and some of the other forthcoming heroes\u2014goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014James Gunn, writer and director of *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, on his decision to return for the film[74]\n\nGunn announced in April 2017 that he would return to write and direct *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*. He said the film would be set after *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), and would \"conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond\".[74] He also felt that the three *Guardians* films would \"work together as a whole\", telling one story,[75] with the third film \"tying a lot of stuff together\" from the first two and giving \"a lot of answers on a lot of different things\".[76] Gunn also planned to work with Marvel on the future of the \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\".[74] He was set to begin work on *Vol. 3* shortly after completing his work as executive producer and consultant on *Infinity War*.[77] On returning for the third film, Gunn said, \"I wouldn't have said yes if I didn't have a fairly clear idea of where we were going and what we were going to do. I'm not a guy that's just going to do it if I don't have a vision for it\".[75]\n\n\nAfter originally including Adam Warlock in his script treatment for *Vol. 2*, Gunn and Feige noted the importance of the character on the cosmic side of the MCU and hinted that he would make an appearance in *Vol. 3*.[78] In May 2017, after the release of *Vol. 2*, Gunn said he would be creating the third film \"over the next three years\",[79] and confirmed that Pom Klementieff would reprise her role as Mantis.[17][80] He also intended to have Elizabeth Debicki reprise her role as Ayesha.[81] By mid-June, Gunn had completed the first draft of his script treatment for the third film, and was considering changing a piece of character info he had placed in the background of the mugshot sequence in the first film (when the Guardians are captured by the Nova Corps).[82] In September, Gunn reiterated that *Vol. 3* would be released \"in a little under three years\",[83] as the film had privately been set for release on May 1, 2020.[84] At the end of February 2018, Gunn planned to meet with Mark Hamill about possibly appearing in the film.[85] In April, Chris Pratt was set to reprise his role as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[17][86] and the following month, Dave Bautista confirmed that he would reprise his role as Drax the Destroyer.[87] Marvel received the completed first draft of the screenplay from Gunn by the end of June, ahead of the beginning of official pre-production on the film.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Firing of James Gunn[edit]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn. This came after conservative commentators, such as Mike Cernovich, began circulating old tweets he had made regarding controversial topics such as rape and pedophilia, and called for his firing.[89][90] The Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn stated, \"The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him\".[89] While not part of the decision to fire Gunn, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger supported the \"unanimous decision\" from the various executives at Marvel and Walt Disney Studios.[91] In response, Gunn said in a series of tweets that when he started his career he was \"making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo\" but felt as he has \"developed as a person, so has my work and my humor\". He continued, \"It's not to say I'm better, but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger. My days saying something just because it's shocking and trying to get a reaction are over\". In a separate statement, Gunn said the tweets at the time were \"totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative\", adding \"I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then\".[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)James Gunn, writer and director of *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*\nIn response to the firing, many of the *Guardians* cast members tweeted support for Gunn. Rooker decided to leave Twitter,[92][93] while fans signed an online petition asking for Gunn to be reinstated which received over 300,000 signatures.[94] The firing also garnered reaction from other Hollywood personalities, such as actress Selma Blair and comedian Bobcat Goldthwait,[93] and inspired opinion pieces on the firing and how it would affect Hollywood from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[95] and news organizations such as *The Hollywood Reporter*,[96] *Variety*,[97] *Deadline Hollywood*,[98] and *Forbes*.[99] On July 30, the cast of the *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, including Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, and Karen Gillan, issued a statement in support of James Gunn, saying, \"We fully support James Gunn. We were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these ten days to respond in order to think, pray, listen, and discuss. In that time, we've been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wish to see James reinstated as director of *Volume 3* as well as discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him\".[94] Despite this and the notable \"vociferous support\" Gunn received, *Variety* reported that Disney was not planning to rehire him as the jokes were \"unacceptable in the #MeToo era and are not in line with Disney's family-friendly image\". *Variety* continued that, despite rumors of Gunn being replaced by established Marvel directors such as Jon Favreau, Taika Waititi, or the Russo brothers, Marvel had yet to meet with any other director, and would most likely hire someone new.[100] In early August, Bautista said that he would fulfill his contract and appear in the film as long as Marvel chose to use Gunn's existing script.[101]\n\n\nDisney and Marvel still wanted to \"move forward quickly\" on the film,[102] and were soon confirmed to be keeping Gunn's script. This, combined with the fact that Gunn did not breach his contract since the tweets were written years before he signed on to the film, had led to \"complicated negotiations\" between Gunn and Disney over his exit settlement. Gunn was expected to be paid $7\u201310\u00a0million or more, and there was some hope that the negotiations could lead to him eventually returning in some capacity, \"even if [it was] to develop and direct another Marvel movie\". Gunn would be free to move on to new projects following the settlement, and other major studios were interested in hiring him including Warner Bros. for their rival superhero franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).[103] During this time, executives at Marvel Studios began \"back channel conversations\" with Disney in an attempt to find a compromise that could lead to Gunn returning to the film in some way. This \"eleventh-hour\" effort from Marvel was inspired by the statements from the film's cast.[102] In mid-August, Gunn met with Horn following a strong push from Gunn's talent agency for him to be given a second chance. Despite this and the reported \"civil and professional\" nature of the meeting, Horn only took it as a courtesy and used it to reaffirm Disney's decision to fire Gunn.[104]\n\n\nLater in August, the small crew that was preparing for pre-production were dismissed as production of the film was postponed so Marvel and Disney could find a director to replace Gunn.[105] Pre-production was to have begun by the end of 2018, with principal photography set for January or February 2019.[105][106] At this time, Bautista was unsure if he would return for the film, as he did not know if he would \"want to work for Disney\" given how they handled the firing of Gunn.[107] In late September, James Gunn's brother Sean, who played Kraglin Obfonteri and provided motion capture for Rocket in the previous *Guardians* films, reiterated that Disney still intended on making the film with James's script, but had not revealed to the cast when production may continue. Sean added that he had been preparing to reprise his roles for the third film before his brother's firing.[25] At the end of the month, Cooper was asked if he would consider directing *Vol. 3* after the success of his directorial debut *A Star Is Born* (2018), but said that he \"could never imagine\" directing a film that he did not write.[108] By mid-October, James Gunn had completed his exit settlement with Disney and was set to write and potentially direct *The Suicide Squad* (2021) for Warner Bros / DC Films.[109]\n\n\n\n#### Rehiring Gunn[edit]\n\n\nThe day after Gunn joined *The Suicide Squad* in mid-October 2018, he was privately notified by Horn that he could return as director for *Vol. 3*. This came after further meetings between the studios and Gunn. Horn had changed his mind after being impressed by Gunn's response to the situation.[110][111] Gunn discussed his commitments to *The Suicide Squad* with Feige,[110] and production on *Vol. 3* was put on hold until February 2021 to allow Gunn to complete *The Suicide Squad* first.[111][112][113] In December, after working with Marvel Studios on the script for *Ant-Man* (2015), Adam McKay said he was willing to work with the studio again and stated that he had discussed taking over as director for *Vol. 3* with Feige, among other projects.[114] In early 2019, Feige and Pratt reiterated that Marvel would still make *Vol. 3*,[115][116] and in March 2019, Gunn was publicly revealed to have been rehired as director of the film. *Deadline Hollywood* stated that Marvel Studios had \"never met with or considered any other director\" for the film.[111] By the end of April, the franchise's five main stars\u2014Pratt, Salda\u00f1a, Bautista, Cooper, and Diesel\u2014were all expected to return for the sequel, with filming to take place in 2020.[6]\n\n\nDiscussing his firing and re-hiring in May 2019, Gunn said that of all the elements of the film that he had been sad to leave when he was fired, the most meaningful to him was the character of Rocket. Gunn personally identifies with Rocket, describing himself and the character as \"the same\".[19] He had actually grown to love the character since working on the first film due to feeling that an origin story for Rocket could justify what a Bugs Bunny-like \"goofy character\" like him could exist in the MCU if it were the saddest one in the universe, crediting it as the \"seed\" of the trilogy. While *Vol. 3* effectively reveals Rocket's backstory through flashbacks akin to those from the story structure of *The Godfather Part II* (1974), Gunn initially considered to tell Rocket's origins in a team-up movie between him and Groot without the other Guardians, but ultimately felt that he had to conclude Peter Quill's story first and then focus on Rocket in a third Guardians-centric film.[117] That month, Gillan confirmed that she was returning for the sequel and expressed excitement for Gunn's return to the franchise.[14] In June, Salda\u00f1a was asked about her role in the film after her character Gamora was killed in *Infinity War*, and she returned to play a younger version in *Endgame* who travels through time to the present. Salda\u00f1a said that Gamora's fate would depend on the plans that Marvel and Gunn have for *Vol. 3*, but that she would like to see Gamora rejoin the Guardians and also be portrayed as \"the most lethal woman in the galaxy\" as she has been referred to previously.[8] Gunn was asked in October if he was unhappy about Marvel's decision to kill Gamora in *Infinity War* and said he was not, adding that he had discussed the storyline with the studio beforehand.[118] According to *Infinity War* and *Endgame* screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Gamora was brought back in *Endgame* specifically so that Gunn could include her in *Vol. 3*,[9] so Gunn found no complications over writing her character arc in *Vol. 3* due to having been told in advance.[119] In December, Gunn was asked if he would have Yondu return in the film and said as long as he was involved with the *Guardians* characters, he would not have the character be resurrected. Gunn felt the stakes of a character's death were important and said characters who die in his films would likely remain dead.[120] Gunn said in February 2020 that bringing Yondu back to life would \"nullify Yondu's sacrifice\" in *Vol. 2*, and said the character would not return unless it was for a prequel or flashback;[121] Gunn later said Yondu would not be resurrected in the film to not diminish his death's meaning.[122] In April, Gunn said the COVID-19 pandemic would not affect production plans for the film at that time,[123] saying the next month that the film would be released \"a little after 2021\".[84]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Gunn turned in a new draft of the film's script and began writing a spin-off television series from *The Suicide Squad* titled *Peacemaker* (2022).[124] A month later, he was planning to begin work on *Vol. 3* in 2021 after completing that film and series.[125] He confirmed in November that the script for *Vol. 3* was finished,[126] and said that very little had changed from his initial ideas despite the production setbacks.[127] The film was given a 2023 release date a month later,[128] with filming set to begin in late 2021.[127][129] Shortly after, it was revealed to also be set after *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* (2022).[130]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nPre-production work creating the designs and visuals for the film began by April 2021.[131] In early May, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released on May 5, 2023.[132] Later that month, Gunn said *Vol. 3* would take place after the events of *Thor: Love and Thunder* (2022), which features several *Guardians* characters.[133] That film concludes the storyline established in *Endgame* which sees Thor journey off with the Guardians. Gunn noted this ending was decided upon \"in editing\" and conflicted with his already-submitted screenplay for *Vol. 3*, since he never planned to feature Thor in the film.[134] Gunn had begun storyboarding the film by June,[135] with filming later revealed to begin in November 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia for an expected end around April 2022.[136][137][138] By then, Bautista said he had not read a script for *Vol. 3* and was unsure if it had changed during the production delays.[136] The next month, Gillan said that she and Klementieff had read the script together and she found it to be incredible, brilliant, emotional and funny. She also felt it was Gunn's \"strongest work yet\" with the Guardians characters.[139] Gunn reiterated that the script had \"basically stayed the same\" from three years prior but he had been \"playing with it in little ways\" over the years. He was in the middle of another draft by the end of the month and said the film would be emotional and have a \"heavier\" story than the previous films,[138][140] with a more grounded approach that was inspired by *The Suicide Squad* and *Peacemaker*.[141] An early option Gunn had in mind for the character who would become the film's main villain and be revealed to be the one who created Rocket was the Fantastic Four villain Annihilus, but Gunn ultimately opted to fill that role with the High Evolutionary.[142] Gunn originally wrote a cameo appearance for Kumail Nanjiani, a friend of his, but removed this after learning Nanjiani was cast as Kingo in Marvel Studios' *Eternals* (2021).[143]\n\n\nBy late August, Gunn and Marvel Studios began meeting with actors for the role of Adam Warlock, including Will Poulter. George MacKay was also on the shortlist and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page was considered for the part.[22][144] Poulter auditioned for the role over Zoom before an in-person screen test with Gunn in Atlanta.[145] When first auditioning for Warlock, Poulter was unaware of who his character's name was other than he had been teased at the post-credits scene of *Vol. 2*, but Marvel just described the role to him as \"an untitled character\" until Poulter was \"drip-fed\" with more information over and over until discovering how steeped Adam Warlock is in the source material.[146] In September, Gillan reiterated her positive comments about the script and said the film would explore the characters from the previous *Guardians* films on a deeper level,[147] while Seth Green, who voices Howard the Duck in the MCU, said the film would be about Gamora and Nebula's story. He did not know at that time if Howard would appear after doing so in the previous *Guardians* films.[148] Poulter was cast as Adam Warlock in October,[22][144] and Gunn said \"dozens of roles\" had already been cast.[149] Poulter was chosen for the part because of his dramatic and comedic abilities and because Gunn \"wanted somebody who was youthful\" and would fit with Marvel Studios' future plans for the character.[23] Casting also took place for various background roles, including aliens and security guards.[150][151] Pratt began rehearsals and camera tests later that month,[152] and a production meeting was held in early November, shortly before the start of filming. Gunn also reiterated his comments on not resurrecting Yondu in the film.[153]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on November 8, 2021,[154] at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia,[151][155] under the working title *Hot Christmas*.[113] Henry Braham serves as cinematographer, after doing so for *Vol. 2*, *The Suicide Squad*, and *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special*.[156] Filming was previously scheduled to begin in January or February 2019 prior to Gunn's firing,[105][106] and then in February 2021,[113] before Gunn began work on *Peacemaker*.[125] With the start of filming, Sylvester Stallone revealed that he would return as Stakar Ogord from *Vol. 2*,[37] and Gunn posted a photo of the main cast members which revealed that Chukwudi Iwuji was part of the film following his collaboration with Gunn on *Peacemaker*.[154][157] Iwuji's screen test for the film was shot on the set of *Peacemaker* with that series' crew, and Marvel repaid this favor by letting Gunn use the *Vol. 3* set and crew to film Ezra Miller's cameo appearance as Barry Allen / The Flash for the *Peacemaker* season finale.[141]\n\n\nProduction designer Beth Mickle said Gunn chose to mainly use practical effects for *Vol. 3* after they did so with their work on *The Suicide Squad*.[158] In February 2021, Gunn stated the film would be shot using Industrial Light & Magic's StageCraft virtual production technology that was developed for the Disney+ *Star Wars* series *The Mandalorian*,[159] but in October, he said they would not be able to use the technology because the sets were too big,[160] believing they were larger than the sets used on *The Suicide Squad*.[161] The interior of the Guardians' new ship, the *Bowie*, was a four-story set.[162] Judianna Makovsky serves as costume designer.[163] *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* was filmed at the same time as *Vol. 3*,[16][164] from February to late April 2022,[165][166] with the same main cast and sets.[130][140][162] Gunn enjoyed being able to switch to filming the special after doing scenes for *Vol. 3*, given the tonal difference between the two with *Vol. 3* being more \"emotional\",[167] feeling it helped provide a \"relief\" to the actors as well,[16] and called the *Holiday Special* shoot easier than *Vol. 3*.[162] In February 2022, Callie Brand was revealed to appear in the film as an alien.[63] Shooting was also expected to occur in London, England, in late 2021.[168] *Vol. 3* is the first MCU film to feature the word \"fuck\" uncensored; it is spoken by Quill. The dialogue \"Open the fucking door\" was not scripted, but improvised by Pratt on Gunn's suggestion,[169][170][171] though there was some consideration over giving the one-liner to Groot instead.[172] Gunn mentioned that the Korean film *The Villainess* (2017) inspired one of the fight scenes in *Vol. 3*.[173][174][175] Filming on *Vol. 3* wrapped on May 6, 2022.[176]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn early June 2022, Daniela Melchior was revealed to have a small role in the film, after previously starring in *The Suicide Squad*. Debicki was also confirmed to be reprising her role as Ayesha,[38] while Maria Bakalova and Nico Santos were also revealed to be appearing in the film.[177][178] In July, Iwuji and Bakalova were revealed to be portraying the High Evolutionary and Cosmo the Spacedog, respectively.[46] Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two *Guardians* films,[49][50] and Slate in the *Holiday Special* and *Vol. 3*.[45][48] The following month, Michael Rosenbaum revealed that he had reprised his role as Martinex from *Vol. 2* in the film.[39] In October 2022, it was revealed that Bakalova would portray Cosmo in the *Holiday Special* ahead of her role in *Vol. 3*.[179] In February 2023, Asim Chaudhry revealed he would appear in the film in an undisclosed role.[180] In April 2023, Linda Cardellini was revealed to be voicing Lylla; she previously appeared in multiple MCU projects as Laura Barton, and starred as Velma Dinkley in the Gunn-written films *Scooby-Doo* (2002) and *Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed* (2004), as well as a cameo in the Gunn-written and directed *Super* (2010).[34] Two days of reshoots occurred.[20] In late April, Tara Strong revealed that she was cast in an undisclosed role.[51] Strong was later revealed to have been cast as Mainframe, replacing Miley Cyrus from *Vol. 2* due to Cyrus' unavailability.[181]\n\n\nThe visual effects were provided by Framestore, Weta FX, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Rodeo FX, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, BUF, Lola VFX, Perception, and Compuhire.[182] Stephane Ceretti returns from the first film to serve as the visual effects supervisor,[183] while Fred Raskin returns from the first two films to serve as the editor,[184] alongside Greg D'Auria, who returns from the *Holiday Special*.[185] Additional editing was provided by Tatiana S. Riegel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (soundtrack)\n\nIn April 2017, Gunn felt the music for the film would be different from what was used for the first two films' soundtracks, *Awesome Mix Vol. 1* and *Vol. 2*.[75] The next month, he added that he was \"panicking\" about the soundtrack and had to make some \"pretty specific choices\" shortly due to the wider range of available music for the story,[186] By early July 2017, Gunn had narrowed down his choices for potential songs to 181, but noted that this list could grow again.[187] All of the songs for the film had been selected by the following month;[188] the songs are not modern and come from Quill's Zune that he received at the end of *Vol. 2*,[189] although Gunn added that the soundtrack was not limited to 1970s pop songs compared to the first two films,[24] instead spanning multiple decades.[134] Gunn was unable to use the song \"Russian Roulette\" by the Lords of the New Church for *Vol. 3* due to a legal battle over its ownership.[190][191] The film opens with an acoustic version of \"Creep\" by Radiohead, which provided \"a much different tone from the beginning than the other two films\".[134] The film ends with \"Dog Days Are Over\" by Florence and the Machine, as Gunn is a fan of its album *Lungs*; he had thought about including the song to wrap-up the trilogy since he started writing *Vol. 2*.[13]\n\n\nThe track list for *Awesome Mix Vol. 3* was revealed in April 2023,[192] and was made available on Spotify and Apple Music on April 3 as part of a larger *Guardians of the Galaxy: The Official Mixtape* playlist, which also featured the soundtracks and scores from the previous two films.[192][193] *Awesome Mix Vol. 3* was released by Hollywood Records on CD and digital download on May 3, 2023, a 12\" 2-LP vinyl on May 5, and is set to release on cassette on July 7.[194]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Gunn revealed that John Murphy was composing the film's score and had already recorded music to be played on set during filming.[195][196] Murphy replaces Tyler Bates, who composed the score for the first two films. However, Bates' theme from the previous films were referenced; Murphy had also replaced Bates as composer of *The Suicide Squad* after Bates left that film during production.[197] Murphy's original score for the film was released digitally on May 3, 2023.[194]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe film was discussed during Marvel Studios' panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, where the first footage was revealed. Iwuji was also announced as playing the High Evolutionary, appearing at the panel in costume.[46] Gunn stated the footage was not released publicly because the visual effects were not complete enough for \"repeated views and close inspection\".[198] An official trailer was released on December 1, 2022, during the CCXP.[27] It featured \"In the Meantime\" by Spacehog. Drew Taylor of *TheWrap* called the trailer a doozy, thrilling, and emotional, and stated that \"Gunn's patented, rollicking 'Guardians of the Galaxy' tone is very much in place\", and noted \"an undercurrent of extreme melancholy\".[199] Carson Burton of *Variety* predicted from the trailer that the film would be \"shaping up to be an emotional ending\" by showing Rocket's memories and Star-Lord missing Gamora.[27] Jay Peters at *The Verge* said the trailer intrigued him as a \"wild ride across the stars\" with different planets.[200]\n\n\nA second trailer for the film was released during Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023. It featured \"Since You Been Gone\" by Rainbow.[201] Grant Hermanns of *Screen Rant* felt the trailer gave \"a deeper look\" at the film, particularly Adam Warlock's powers as compared to his brief appearance in the first one. Hermanns also said the second trailer \"goes a step further in highlighting the emotional story\" after the first one \"efficiently set [the film's] tone, featuring plenty of melancholic shots of the [Guardians of the Galaxy] facing the music\".[202] The trailer accumulated 134.1\u00a0million views across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, and was the most-watched Super Bowl trailer in post-game day traffic according to RelishMix. It was also the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that a Super Bowl trailer exceeded 100 million views on social media in a 24-hour period.[203]\n\n\nDisney and Marvel Music partnered with the music streaming service Spotify in May 2023, to promote the film. As part of the promotion, a playlist, titled the \"K-GOTG Radio Experience\", was created.[204] Marvel Studios also promoted the film with General Mills limited-edition cereals and snacks, including Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Lucky Charms, Trix, Reese's Puffs, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Go-Gurt.[205] Microsoft also partnered with Marvel Studios to promote the film with a limited-edition Zune MP3 player; a single non-functional model would be created using 3D printing and launched inside the International Space Station.[206]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* had an early screening at Dongdaemun Design Plaza on April 19, 2023.[207] The film premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023,[208][209] and its North American premiere was held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 27.[210] The film was released in several countries including the United Kingdom on May 3, 2023, and in the United States on May 5.[211][212][213][214] It was previously set for release on May 1, 2020,[84] before it was dropped from that date.[215] It is part of Phase Five of the MCU.[46] It was released in 3D, IMAX, Dolby Cinema, 4DX, and ScreenX.[216]\n\n\nDisney released over 600 unique versions of the film to theaters, including a version with variable aspect ratios. Forty-five minutes of the film was presented in the flat 1.85:1 aspect ratio, while the rest of the film is in the 2.39:1 letterboxed aspect ratio.[217]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on digital download on July 7, 2023; on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 1;[218] and on Disney+ on August 2,[219] where an IMAX Enhanced version was also available.[220] The film was the final physical media release for Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in Australia, as they decided to discontinue selling their films on physical home media there.[221]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* has grossed $359\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $486.6\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $845.6\u00a0million.[3][4]\n\n\nIn the US and Canada, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* was projected to gross around $110\u00a0million from 4,450 theaters in its opening weekend.[207] The film made $48.2\u00a0million on its first day,[222] including $17.5\u00a0million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut with $118.4\u00a0million, topping the box office.[223] In its second weekend, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* retained the top spot at the box office with $62\u00a0million,[224][225][226] a 48% decline from its opening weekend and the best second-weekend hold of any sequel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a notably smaller second-weekend decline than those of the franchise's recent releases, including *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (70%), *Thor: Love and Thunder* (68%), and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (67%).[226][227] The film made $32 million in its third weekend, being dethroned by *Fast X*.[228]\n\n\nOutside the US and Canada, the film grossed $168.1 million in its opening weekend.[229] In its second weekend, the film grossed $92 million for a drop of 40% from its opening weekend. As of May 27, 2023, the highest grossing territories were China ($77.4 million), the United Kingdom ($36 million), Mexico ($30.8 million), South Korea ($26.7 million), and France ($24.3 million).[230]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 82% based on 401 reviews with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"A galactic group hug that might squeeze a little too tight on the heartstrings, the final *Guardians of the Galaxy* is a loving last hurrah for the MCU's most ragtag family.\"[231] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[232] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the previous two *Guardians* films, while PostTrak reported that moviegoers gave the film a 91% positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend it.[223]\n\n\n*The Independent* found it was \"the best Marvel movie in years\"[233] as did *Vox*[234] and the CBC.[235] In mixed reviews, Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian*[236] and Nicholas Barber of the BBC agreed the film was overlong, Barber opining that \"the film's saving grace is that, just as Gunn has been allowed to unleash his gonzo imagination, he has also been allowed to pour out his emotions.\"[237] Wendy Ide of *The Observer* lauded the films for its emotional weight and deemed it a satisfying conclusion, stating that \"What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the *GOTG* series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the *Guardians* USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.\"[238] Matt Singer from *ScreenCrush* praised the film for concluding Rocket's arc story stating that \"a character tells Rocket that the events unfolding onscreen have been *his* story all along \u2014 and with *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, it does feel like Marvel has spent $200 million on a movie about a melancholy space raccoon looking for love and acceptance.\"[239] Writing for *The Verge,* Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the film's action sequences and storyline and commented that \"*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* tells the action-packed, flashback-filled story of how Rocket Raccoon's (Bradley Cooper) life being gravely endangered gives the rest of the Guardians a reason to come together and really start working on some of the emotional issues that've been haunting them since *Endgame*.\"[240] *The Hindustan Times* praised Gunn's direction and writing, commenting that \"As James Gunn concludes his journey with these characters he clearly cares so deeply about, you can't help but reflect on your own. Walking out, I had my own little flashback montage playing in my head of all the adventures we've been on and foes we've faced with this lovable group of galaxy-saving idiots.\"[241] Nathan Durr of CBS News praised the film's soundtrack and stated that \"There's no exception here regarding the soundtrack as Gunn and company cleverly implement songs that add weight to the complexities and emotions of the characters.\"[242]\n\n\nA negative review from NPR criticized the approach of cruelty to animals in the film[243] while *The New York Times* called it a \"dour, visually off-putting two-and-a-half-hour A.S.P.C.A. nightmare of a film (that) may only be for completionist fans\",[244] and the *Chicago Tribune*, \"the most empty, brutal MCU movie yet\".[245] Conversely, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) declared the film to be \"the best animal rights film of the year\", and gave Gunn a \"Not a Number Award\" for his depiction of animal testing.[246]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nCynthia Blondelle and Heather Kreamer were nominated at the 2023 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards for Best Music Supervision in a Trailer \u2013 Film.[247] *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* received nominations for Best Fantasy Adventure, Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer, and Best Teaser at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.[248][249] The film was nominated for Best Picture at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.[250] The *Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3: Awesome Mix, Vol. 3* soundtrack is nominated for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 66th Grammy Awards.[251]\n\n\n\n## Documentary special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Marvel Studios: Assembled*\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series *Marvel Studios: Assembled* was announced.[252] The special on this film, *Assembled: The Making of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, was released on Disney+ on September 13, 2023.[253]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nGunn said in April 2017 that a fourth *Guardians* film could happen, though it would likely center on a new group of characters since Gunn planned to conclude the story of the current team in *Vol. 3*.[254] Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for another *Guardians* film but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters.[255] One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called \"brilliant\". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not \"very interested, or it doesn't fit into the way they have things mapped out\".[256] Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended for *Vol. 3* to be his last *Guardians* film,[257] which he reaffirmed in May 2021.[258] In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula after *Vol. 3*.[259] In April 2023, Salda\u00f1a confirmed that *Vol. 3* would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue.[11] The following month, Pratt indicated his willingness to continue playing Peter Quill in the future if the right script came along,[260] and a note at the end of *Vol. 3*'s post-credits scene states that the \"Legendary Star-Lord\" would return to the MCU.[43]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As established in *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* (2022)\n2. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017)\n3. **^** Introduced through time travel in *Avengers: Endgame* (2019)\n4. **^** Director James Gunn confirmed on Twitter that the film shows the High Evolutionary being rescued by Drax during the evacuation of the ship, with the High Evolutionary being imprisoned on Knowhere off-screen afterwards.[5]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (12A)\". *BBFC*.

It is the sequel to *F9* (2021), the tenth main installment, and the eleventh installment overall in the *Fast & Furious* franchise. It stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto alongside an ensemble cast including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Jason Momoa, and Charlize Theron. In the film, Toretto must protect his family from Dante Reyes (Momoa), who seeks revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune.\n\n\nWith a tenth film planned since 2014, and a two-part finale planned since October 2020, Lin was confirmed to return to direct with the main cast attached. The film's official title was revealed when principal photography began in April 2022. Lin left as director later that month, citing creative differences, though he retained writing and producing credits. Leterrier was then hired as his replacement a week later and performed several uncredited rewrites to the screenplay. Longtime franchise composer Brian Tyler returned to score the film. With an estimated production budget of $340\u00a0million, *Fast X* would be the eighth-most expensive film ever made. Filming lasted until that August, taking place in London, Rome, Turin, other Italian cities, Lisbon, and Los Angeles.\n\n\n*Fast X* premiered in Rome on May 12, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 19, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences and Momoa's performance but criticism towards the writing. The film grossed $714\u00a0million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2023. A sequel is in development and scheduled to be released on April 4, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nDominic Toretto and his team are requested by the Agency to steal a computer chip during its transit in Rome. Dom and his wife Letty Ortiz stay behind with his son Brian \"Little B\" Marcos, while the rest of the team, consisting of Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, Han Lue, and Ramsey, travels to Rome. A wounded Cipher arrives at Dom's home and informs him and Letty that Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, has turned her crew against her and is using them to target Dom as revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune ten years prior.[b] When Little Nobody says that there is no Agency mission in Rome, Dom and Letty realize that Dante set them up and they go to rescue the team.\n\n\nIn Rome, Dante releases a metal ball bomb into the streets. Dom pushes it into the Tiber River, minimizing the damage, but Letty is arrested. Agent Aimes, the Agency's de facto leader since Mr. Nobody's disappearance,[c] believes that Dom and his team are responsible for the bombing and begins a manhunt. In Los Angeles, Dom's brother Jakob rescues Little B and Mia, his and Dom's sister, from a squad sent by Dante to kidnap Little B and with her approval, takes Little B to a secret location in Portugal, where they will await Dom. Mr. Nobody's daughter, Tess, is convinced of the team's innocence and uses God's Eye[d] to find Dom in Naples, informing him that Dante is in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\nThere, Dom confronts Dante and meets Isabel Neves, the sister of Little B's late mother Elena.[e] Dom later challenges Dante to a race, along with Isabel and his ally, Diogo. However, Dante wins while killing Diogo and injuring Isabel. Tess visits Letty at the black site and covertly wounds her to send her to the prison's treatment center, where Letty meets Cipher. They discover the black site is located in Antarctica and they must work together to escape. In London, Dom's team turns to Deckard Shaw for help, through the convincing of Han after a scuffle between himself and Deckard. \n\n\nAimes joins forces with Dom to fight Dante. Dante locates Little B in Portugal and kidnaps him. As Dom is cornered by mercenaries, Jakob sacrifices himself to take them all out, allowing Dom to rescue his son. Dante again corners Dom and his son, just as Roman, Tej, Han, and Ramsey arrive by plane to aid Dom. Realizing too late, Dom tells Roman to turn the plane around, but Aimes, revealed to be working for Dante, shoots down the plane, leaving each member of the team's fates unknown.

He's got a lot of issues. He's definitely got some daddy issues\".[27] Momoa expressed a desire to play against type when portraying Dante, taking on a \"less macho\" character,[28] and he performed his own stunts for the film.[29]\n* Charlize Theron as Cipher: A criminal mastermind and cyberterrorist who was previously an enemy of Dom's team.[6][9] Leterrier described Cipher as the \"devil\", and speaking on her dynamic with Dante, Leterrier said, \"They are bad news, but one is more afraid than the other. One is worse news than the other\".[7][30]\n\n\nGal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson reprise their roles from the franchise uncredited as Gisele Yashar and Luke Hobbs during the final scene and mid-credits scene, respectively.[31][32][33] Joaquim de Almeida reprises his role as Hernan Reyes, a ruthless drug lord and Dante's father, from *Fast Five*, while Leo Abelo Perry portrays Brian \"Little B\" Marcos, Dom's son.[34] Luis Da Silva reprises his role from *Fast Five* as Diogo, a Brazilian street racer who allies with Dom and his crew.[35] Making cameo appearances are Brazilian singer Ludmilla as a race starter in Rio de Janeiro,[36] Pete Davidson as Bowie, a friend of Ramsey,[37] Paul Walker's daughter Meadow as a flight attendant helping Jakob,[38] and Debby Ryan and Josh Dun (credited as themselves) as a couple in an airport.[39]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justin Lin, who directed five films in the franchise, originally returned as director of *Fast X*.\nIn November 2014, Universal Pictures chairwoman Donna Langley said there would be at least three more films in the franchise after *Furious 7* (2015).[40] In April 2017, producer Neal H. Moritz stated that the tenth entry would serve as the finale for the franchise with Chris Morgan attached as screenwriter.[41] In October 2017, Justin Lin entered negotiations to direct the ninth and tenth installments after directing four films in the series.[42] In February 2020, Vin Diesel hinted the film could be split in two,[43] which he confirmed in an April 2021 press conference, stating, \"There's so much ground to cover and so many places in so many locations that we have to visit\" as the rationale behind the decision for a two-part finale.[44] Prior to production, Diesel announced filming would take place in Italy, stating, \"I was asked, 'Would there ever be a *Fast* where you could film in Italy?', and I [promised] we would\".[45] While Morgan ultimately did not return as screenwriter, it was confirmed he would serve as an executive producer on the film, alongside Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Amanda Lewis, and Mark Bomback.[46]\n\n\nBy April 2022, a new screenplay draft was written by Lin and Dan Mazeau.[47] On June 5, 2022, Tyrese Gibson announced *Fast X* would see the franchise \"going back to its roots\", with reports indicating this to be a return to street racing elements of previous entries,[48] although shared details the film would also continue to explore the history of the Toretto family in a \"similar\" vein to *F9*;[49] Leterrier later revealed the film focuses on increased familial responsibilities, saying, \"Dom was always a lone wolf. He was living a quarter mile at a time [but] the stakes are real now. [He is] responsible for a human being, an innocent life [he] brought into the world\".[30] Gibson also expressed a desire for the franchise to film in South Africa, stating, \"me and Luda always had this idea [that] it's time for us to head to South Africa. It needs real estate in this franchise [because] it [has] a beautiful skyline with ocean. It's the *Fast and Furious* package\".[50] Ludacris later stated his favorite franchise filming location was his home city of Atlanta, Georgia,[51] and revealed that he did not anticipate returning to the franchise after his initial appearance in *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003).[52] During an August 2022 interview with *ComicBook*, Nathalie Emmanuel said \"the stakes are higher on a more personal level in this [film]\", indicating a more grounded approach compared to previous installments.[53] In developing the character of Dante, Leterrier revealed they wanted to forge the \"anti-Dom\", saying, \"[Dante] is the yang of [Dom's] yin, the antichrist of his Christ\", and wanted to give Dante clear motivation with Dom's role in Dante's origin story, noting, \"There are strong ties with [Dante and Dom] and that is what makes an amazing villain because you understand why they became this and [their motivations]\".[30] Leterrier noted Larson's character as also being influenced by \"the generational legacy of the characters\", saying, \"Everybody [in the franchise] has a different point of view on Dom and his own influence on their lives. And that's how she [fits in]\".[30]\n\n\nDescribing the film's retcon of *Fast Five* (2011), Leterrier said it was to \"explore the price of justice\", noting, \"[We] *Rashomon*'ed [the fifth film] to experience it through the eyes of Reyes, with Dom and Brian the thieves. We [wanted to] guide the audience to rethink everything they've experienced in the franchise [because] a good antagonist has their own truth, [separate] from the protagonists\".[30] Leterrier noted the film touches on each previous installment, saying, \"The snowball [of Dom's actions] has picked up speed and became an avalanche\", and said his favorite film in the franchise is *Fast Five*.[30] Leterrier later revealed he performed several uncredited rewrites to the entire screenplay on his initial travel to the set, stating he lacked sleep for the first four days he worked on the film.[54] During the film's early promotional run, Leterrier said *Fast X* explores the potential breakup of family, noting \"people are going to need to take sides [and] alliances will need to be made\" compounded by \"[the] war brewing\" between the characters, saying \"there will be some tremendous casualties\".[55] He later confirmed the film will end on a cliffhanger,[56] and further hinted at character deaths, saying, \"The beauty of the end of this franchise [is] understanding these characters will [not] live forever. Only in Westerns do cowboys gallop out into the sunset. This is different; the stakes even more than they've been before\".[57] This was seemingly confirmed by Michelle Rodriguez, who considered the fan reaction to the ending, saying, \"You're going to feel so cheated in a way, but then so gratified and excited about what's to come. After 23 years of [making films], it's really tough at this stage to shock me, and they got me good\".[58] She reiterated this in a promotional interview with *Collider* for *Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves* (2023), saying the ending of *Fast X* would \"[leave] people really surprised and we're [going to] get open mouths at the end. In [the] theater, I was like, 'Oh my god. What have we done?!'\".[59]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Collider*, Universal Pictures producer Kelly McCormick stated the impact of COVID-19 and the production schedules of \"our interfering projects\" (like *Fast X* and its sequel) caused delays in developing the sequel to *Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw* (2019).[60] Filming in Turin required the Film Commission Torino Piemonte, local authorities, and city councilors to conduct a five-month planning schedule from September 2021 to January 2022, collaborating with the Departments of Culture to coordinate the city's major events, roads and transport, public, and security around filming requirements. Such planning included managing the overflight of drones and limitations on circulation made necessary for the management and safety of the set.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Vehicles[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* is the first film in the series to feature electric cars, with leaked set photos featuring the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Banshee Concept and the gull-winged DeLorean Alpha5. Other vehicles set to feature include the 2022 TorRed Dodge Charger R/T, the 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye, and the 1970 Charger R/T, the latter a franchise staple.[62] On June 27, 2022, it was reported *Fast X* would include the fan favorite orange and black Veilside Mazda RX-7 FD Fortune, which first featured in *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift* (2006).[63] The inclusion of the electric Dodge Chargers in the film was confirmed upon release of the first trailer on February 9, 2023, with the \"Greys of Thunder\" Dodge Charger Daytona SRT also appearing in other promotional material. In an interview with Fox News, a Dodge spokesperson said the company \"has a long-standing marketing partnership with *Fast & Furious*\", which will continue with *Fast X*.[64] Other vehicles expected to feature in the film include the foreign-made Lamborghini Gallardo, Alfa Romeo 159, Nissan Silvia, Porsche 911 997 GT3 RS, Pagani Huayra Tricolore, and the Datsun 240Z, as well as the U.S.-made Chevrolet Impala and El Camino, Lenco BearCat Armoured Vehicle, and the 1966 Ford Fairlane.[65] In an interview with vehicle co-ordinator Dennis McCarthy, who worked on every *Fast & Furious* film since *Tokyo Drift* (2006), each significant car featured on screen required around seven duplicates, resulting in an estimated 200 cars built for *Fast X* to race-car standards required for the stunt work.[66] In April 2023, Momoa revealed that he personally contacted Jochen Zeitz, the CEO of Harley-Davidson, to secure six motorcycles to be used in the film for his character.[67] He is seen riding the Harley-Davidson Pan America throughout the movie, which was modified with an upgraded exhaust system and extra shielding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJason Momoa, Daniela Melchior, Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson and Rita Moreno joined the main cast for *Fast X*.\n\nIn June 2021, Diesel announced the film would be split in a two-part culmination to the franchise, with principal photography slated to begin in January 2022 and take place back-to-back.[69][70] In December 2021, Dwayne Johnson ruled out returning for *Fast X*, and labeled an Instagram post by Diesel asking for his return as \"manipulation\",[71] with publications indicating he was referring to a feud with Diesel stemming from Diesel's role as an executive producer on *The Fate of the Furious* (2017).[72][73] He ultimately reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in a mid-credits scene cameo appearance.[32][33][31]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Jason Momoa was cast as Dante, the villain,[24] while Daniela Melchior, Brie Larson, and Alan Ritchson joined the cast by that April.[11][16][12] Keanu Reeves was originally approached to play Aimes, having been previously in talks to join the franchise with the role of the Eteon Director in *Hobbs & Shaw*, but plans shifted and Ritchson was contacted about taking over the role while filming *Ordinary Angels* (TBA), an offer he considered and accepted once production on that film was halted because of the announcement that the biggest blizzard in Winnipeg's history was coming to the set.[74] Larson was initially hesitant to join another franchise after the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), saying, \"I was scared of what would happen to me [by joining *Fast & Furious*]. But what I always come back to is, I have to live with myself in a way that nobody else has to. The choices I make, I have to live with, whether I regret them or not\",[75] but stated *Fast & Furious* was her \"dream franchise\", saying, \"I've been begging to be in this for years. Being part of something you've watched your whole life and that you love is an amazing feeling\".[76]\n\n\nIn a March 2023 interview with *Total Film*, Larson revealed she would portray Tess, the daughter of government agent and covert operations team leader Mr. Nobody; she described Tess as \"a bridge\", saying, \"she doesn't go along with the Agency. She believes in the legacy her father set up, standing with Dom and the Toretto family\".[77] Describing Momoa's addition, director Louis Leterrier said Dante is \"an incredible new character. It's 1,000 per cent Momoa\",[78] while Michelle Rodriguez said Dante is \"malicious but he can be playful. It's like a fresh energy. There's something charming about him\".[79] She later labeled Dante as the best male villain in the franchise's history, describing him as \"revenge with a smirk\".[80] After being cast, Momoa was initially apprehensive over filming conditions due to reports of conflict on set between Diesel and Lin,[81] and said he accepted the role to play against type.[82] In May, Rita Moreno was cast as Abuelita, the grandmother of Dom, Jakob, and Mia,[21] with Leterrier describing her inclusion as the \"guiding light that Dom is following\", adding, \"[Abuelita] is his conscience, [she is one] of the people that keep him grounded. When your grandmother you haven't seen for years gives you a message that becomes guiding for the second part of your life, you listen\".[30] In a February 2023 interview with *Collider*, Moreno's grandson said he pitched for her inclusion in *Fast X* after he met Diesel at the premiere for *West Side Story* (2021), which starred Moreno.[83]\n\n\nOn December 23, 2022, it was revealed that Gal Gadot, who portrayed Gisele Yashar in three previous installments, filmed a scene for *Fast X*; according to social media reports, she appeared in one of two versions of the film screened three days prior, with further details about the nature of her return undisclosed.[84] Gadot's potential return was met with mixed reception by fans and critics; some criticized the franchise's history of reviving dead characters to capitalize on star power, labeling it \"ineffective\" fan service which negatively impacts the previous installments and the story of the franchise.[85][86][87] Others were positive about Gadot's potential return, citing her portrayal of one of the franchise's most popular characters.[88] In a February 2023 interview with *ComicBook*, Sung Kang refused to rule out Gadot's character being resurrected in *Fast X*.[89] As the final cast rounded out, it sparked debate that it could create a story problem for the film; writing for *Screen Rant*, Ryan Northrup said, \"With such a large cast, it's uncertain whether *Fast X* will be able to serve [every] character in a satisfying way. With many new and returning characters, [every] arc may not be as fleshed out [and if] new characters aren't given much screen time or development, [it will be] a disappointment. [It may be] up to the finale to rectify [it]\".[90]\n\n\nA month later, a leaked email from *The Hollywood Reporter* revealed some crew returned after principal photography had completed to film a \"button or tag\" (a mid or post-credits scene) that will feature \"a guest cameo\".[91] Gadot and Johnson ultimately reprised their roles in cameo appearances.[31] Rodriguez and Diesel later said Gadot's return had been planned for previous installments (going as far as to film unused cameos), with Diesel reasoning the decision to include Gadot in *Fast X* was done because it \"fit the [film]\". He also said, \"Doing tags is tricky because you want great talent but at the same time you have to be very careful to maintain the emotional state of your audience\".[92] Several actors who were reported to be reprising their roles from previous films in *Fast X* did not end up doing so, including Michael Rooker as Buddy,[6][93] Cardi B as Leysa,[94] Don Omar as Rico Santos, and Tego Calder\u00f3n as Tego Leo, respectively.[95]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the film's trailer on February 9, 2023, Leterrier hinted archival footage featuring Paul Walker from previous films may be used in *Fast X*, saying, \"Brian is very much alive in [this franchise]. This [film] jumps back and forth between the past and the present. You will see Brian in the past, you won't see Brian in the present. [His] family is part of this franchise. It has to be the right moment, the right tone [if] Brian has to re-enter the franchise. [It must be] as perfect as how he left\".[96] Regarding Walker's inclusion, Rodriguez said, \"It's really hard to [make the films] without a blessing of some sort from [his] family because it's everything. Without that kind of like that love from them, we would be lost\". She also revealed *Furious 7* (2015) is her favorite film in the franchise, citing its emotional tribute to Walker.[97] Diesel similarly commented on Walker's potential inclusion in the film in a March 2023 interview with *Total Film*, saying, \"[Universal] made a bold, righteous, and daring decision to keep Brian O'Conner alive. I couldn't image this saga ending without truly saying goodbye to Brian\".[57]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 21, 2022, with the film's title being revealed and Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, and Charlize Theron confirmed to reprise their roles.[6][9] According to Diesel, an earlier draft excluded Brewster's character, which he overturned. *Fast X*'s production budget was initially reported to be $300\u00a0million in May 2022, which was revised to $340\u00a0million that November; the cast was reportedly paid $100\u00a0million for their involvement,[98] including $20\u00a0million for Diesel.[99] Other costs for the rising budget (which factors in tax-incentive offsets) included increases in production costs caused by global inflation and charges for pandemic testing requirements mandated by COVID-19 safety protocols.[100] According to unnamed sources reporting to *Radar*, Diesel reportedly \"stressed\" over the increased budget and the creative decisions in *Fast X*; sources wrote Diesel is considered by Universal as \"simultaneously the greatest star [they've] had and their biggest headache\" and that \"[Diesel] doesn't let anybody forget [how] the *Fast & Furious* franchise is important to the whole [film] industry\".[101]\n\n\nA week after filming commenced, Lin exited the film as director due to \"creative differences\", leaving primary production stalled. However, Lin remained on board as a producer.[102] Later reports alleged that Lin clashed on set with Diesel, who purportedly arrived out of shape, was often late, and did not remember his lines.[103] Lin was also upset with rewrites to his screenplay, as well as changing filming locations and one of the film's villains having yet to be cast;[98] a disagreement with Diesel reportedly escalated to the point it caused Lin to shout, \"This movie is not worth my mental health\";[104] Lin reportedly forewent pay in the region of $10\u201320\u00a0million in his departure.[105] Second unit production remained ongoing in the United Kingdom while the studio sought a replacement director.[106] Universal Pictures reportedly spent $1\u00a0million a day to pause production.[107] Former *Fast & Furious* directors F. Gary Gray and David Leitch, who previously directed *The Fate of the Furious* and *Hobbs & Shaw* respectively, were considered by the studio to replace Lin, however neither were likely to step in due to their commitments with *Lift* and *The Fall Guy* (both 2024), respectively.[108][109] *Furious 7* director James Wan, who was once considered to direct *The Fate of the Furious* and *F9* but declined due to his straining experience on *Furious 7*, was also considered a \"viable option\" but was tied with commitments to *Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom* (2023), the final DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film.[109][110] *Variety* reported hiring an \"A-list\" director was not probable without drastic changes to the screenplay and Universal would likely turn to a second unit director \"well-versed\" in big-budget action films.[109] On May 2, 2022, Louis Leterrier was announced as Lin's replacement.[111]\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis Leterrier replaced Lin as director a week after filming began.\nLeterrier already had an established relationship with the studio, having previously directed the MCU film *The Incredible Hulk* (2008), and he was knowledgeable about the franchise;[112] he and franchise star Jason Statham went to watch the original film in Paris in 2001 while on a break from filming *The Transporter* (2002).[113] Leterrier joined filming in London after scheduling and contractual considerations were confirmed;[114][115] he later revealed he initially rejected the offer to direct the film, labeling it a \"massive\" task,[54] although later used elements of Lin's original contributions, such as the established crew, as well as Lin's shot lists and storyboards, to complete the film.[105] Production in London concluded in mid-August, with scenes filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden.[116] Rodriguez later revealed a fight sequence between her and Theron was shot without a principal director, being done while studio negotiations with Leterrier were ongoing.[58] Ritchson initially thought he would lose the role of Aimes upon being informed by producer Jeff Kirschenbaum about the directing change, but was quickly reassured by Kirschenbaum that he was still cast and that he would just not collaborate with Lin.[74] Describing his style for the film, Leterrier said, \"I'm more practical than other directors, and I brought [the franchise] back to earth\", revealing he favored more practical stunts (including a return of racing scenes featuring a \"vertical quarter mile race\") enhanced with visual effects,[117] as opposed to the extensive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the recent installments.[55][30]\n\n\nFilming took place in Genzano di Roma[118] in mid-May. Filming took place in Rome for two weeks in mid-May,[119] and one week in mid-July,[120] with scenes being shot at the Via Cristoforo Colombo, Lungotevere, Via dei Fori Imperiali, Ponte Umberto I, Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, and the area around the Castel Sant'Angelo and the Spanish Steps.[121] Filming then took place in Turin between May 24 and June 6, with action sequences filmed at the Piazza Crimea and Corso Fiume, Murazzi del Po, Via Roma, and the Piazza IV Marzo.[122] Momoa began shooting his scenes on May 16.[119] Like previous installments, Diesel supervised writing and design of the film's action sequences; according to unnamed sources to *The Hollywood Reporter*, Diesel's creative control and frequent last-minute changes reflect \"a process [which] is like a mosaic that doesn't stop moving\", labeling him \"demanding\" and a perfectionist.[104] On June 6, it was reported a stuntman was injured in an accident after being hit by part of a car after an explosion.[123] On July 22, in an interview with *Deadline Hollywood* while at San Diego Comic-Con, Rodriguez announced she had completed filming her scenes and said \"only four [or] five weeks [are] left\" in production.[124] Filming in Angelino Heights (the location of the Toretto house) faced protest from some local residents after production gave notice of the filming of a sequence which would involve \"simulated emergency services activity, aerial photography, wetting down of street and atmospheric smoke\". According to those residents, the protest was to raise awareness for road safety education, claiming the franchise caused their neighborhood to become a hot spot for fans to engage in street racing and other dangerous activity.[125] Filming managed to occur following the protest on August 26,[126] while other portions were filmed in Portugal, such as in Lisbon, Viseu, and Vila Real. In an interview with Lusa News Agency, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Azevedo, the mayor of Viseu, announced filming would take place on IP5, a highway in the Vouzela municipality.[127] Ritchson finished filming his scenes by August 16,[128] and hinted at flying cars in the film, stating \"we're going to take it to the sky\".[129]\n\n\nDuring filming, Sofia Noronha, a producer for Sagesse Productions (the company in charge of overseeing production of *Fast X* in Portugal) said a \"brutal economic investment\" will be made in the country by the film. Highlighting the weather, affordability through tax breaks, and flexibility of the production, Noronha argued \"investments [from film] made in the country is almost double that tax incentive. The [producing] country always benefits\".[127] This was echoed during filming in Turin, with it reported the two-week schedule generated \u20ac3.8 million for the local economy, coming mainly from expenses related to location rent, hospitality, technical staff and local workforce employment, security and sanitation, and storage and unloading. It was also reported the film regularly brought troupes of close to 400 people (5 times above average for comparable films) and often collaborated with hundreds of local professionals on the research of locations and finalization of the working filming plan.[122] In a statement, Beatrice Borgia, President of Film Commission Torino Piemonte, said \"*Fast X* is a confirmation of the key role Turin and Piedmont has gained in filmmaking. [We have] proved to have all what is needed to host complex productions: skilled professionals, supportive institutions, and amazing locations\".[122]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nDylan Highsmith and Kelly Matsumoto, both of whom were two of the three co-editors on *F9*, return as editors with Laura Yanovich and Corbin Mehl joining. Peter Chiang returns as the visual effects supervisor for the production, after doing so for *F9*, with DNEG and Industrial Light & Magic as the returning visual effects vendors. In a July 2022 interview with *The Hollywood Reporter*, Michelle Rodriguez praised the addition of Leterrier and his predominantly French-speaking creative team, labeling it \"the French takeover, dude\". She stated Leterrier \"came with all this energy of love [from] a real fan of [the] franchise who really wants to take it places that it hasn't gone before. It reminds you [how] beautiful and magical [filmmaking] is\".[130] Several aerial shots were filmed with first-person view (FPV) drones with an attached WarpCam\u00ae piloted by Johnny Schaer, similar to the filming techniques that were used for the action sequences in Michael Bay's *Ambulance* (2022). Schaer previously supervised the drone-led filming in Rawson Marshall Thurber's *Red Notice* (2021).[131] The filmmakers researched pre-existing and unused footage of *Fast Five* through Universal's archival department as the film had dailies for \"alternate takes and different angles\". Such footage was composited to provide changes for *Fast X*'s flashback, integrating the characters into it using motion control photography and CGI.[132] In March 2023, the writing credits were finalized; Mazeau and Lin received screenplay credits, and both shared story credits with Zach Dean.[133] In May 2023, despite his initial refusal to return to the franchise, it was announced that Dwayne Johnson would appear as Luke Hobbs in the movie's mid-credits scene.[33]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fast X (soundtrack)\n\nThe first single for the film's soundtrack, \"Let's Ride\", was released on February 10, 2023, performed by YG, Ty Dolla Sign, and Lambo4oe. The soundtrack features hip hop, pop, reggaeton, electronic rock, and rhythmic Latin tracks. The second song from the film, \"Won't Back Down\", performed by YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Bailey Zimmerman, and Dermot Kennedy, was released on May 4. The soundtrack of the film was released on May 19, by Artist Partner Group.[134]\n\n\nIn March 2023 during post-production, Brian Tyler was returned to composed the film score after he previously scoring some of the film franchise starting with the third installment *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift* (2006).[135] The official score album was being released on June 2, 2023, by Back Lot Music.[136]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nParts of *Fast X* previewed at CineEurope in Barcelona in June 2022, including a first look at Jason Momoa and Brie Larson. Speaking of the film, Universal Pictures International President of Distribution, Veronika Kwan Vandenberg, stated the studio's drive was to continue to \"cater to the diverse tastes\" expected from the franchise.[137] At the 2022 Grio Awards, Tyrese Gibson stated he watched the completed film on October 20, 2022, describing it as \"crazy\" with \"just too much magic\", and announced an extended version of the film's trailer would first premiere at Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023.[138] This was seemingly confirmed in a December 2022 social media post by Vin Diesel, who wrote the trailer was \"less than two months away\",[139] and was made it official in January 2023 post.[140] In a January 2023 report by *Collider*, it was confirmed the first trailer would debut worldwide on February 10, 2023 (after being screened at a private fan event a day prior); it was three minutes long,[141] and was followed with a Super Bowl spot alongside *Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves*, *Cocaine Bear*, *Scream VI*, *65*, *Air*, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* and *The Flash* (all 2023).[142][143] Beginning February 1, to promote the release of the trailer, official recuts of the trailers of each of the previous nine films, dubbed \"Legacy Trailers\", were released daily in conjunction with *IGN*.[144] The fan event took place at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles, being hosted by Maria Menounos and featuring Diesel, Rodriguez, Gibson, Ludacris, and Cody Walker, the brother of the series' longtime initial star Paul Walker.[145] Similar fan events also took place in Mexico, France, and Japan but did not feature the cast.[146]\n\n\nOn February 1, the film's teaser poster was released, depicting Diesel alone in the center, bowing his head and clutching a cross between his fists on a dark to light backdrop. Writing for *Collider*, Safeeyah Kazi said his positioning depicts \"an intense prayer\" with the \"small amount of light [from the cross] engulfing his fist acting as the optimism in the dark\". She also said that the relative simplicity of the poster compared to the \"color explosion\" for *F9* could indicate a grittier storyline in *Fast X*. Kazi wrote the film's \"the end of the road begins\" tagline depicted \"a new level of intensity\", and speculated it could refer to the end for some of the franchise's characters.[147] In an analysis by Matt Singer of WBUF, Singer described the poster as \"somber\", noting it as \"remarkably tense\" compared to the posters for other entries in the franchise.[148] Stills from the film detailing Momoa, Larson, and Diesel's characters were publicly released on February 9,[149] and was followed by a teaser showcasing the main cast a day later.[150] The official trailer then released soon after,[151] featuring an orchestral flip of \"Notorious Thugs\" by The Notorious B.I.G. and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony from the former's album *Life After Death* (1997).[152] The trailer was mostly positively received; writing for *GQ*, Grant Rindner labeled the trailer \"glorious absurdity\", stating it is \"as glossy and over-the-top as recent features\". He commended the return of racing scenes, saying it \"restores the original feeling\" of the films, and said the music was an \"operatic nail-biter\".[153]\n\n\nAccording to data from social media analytics company RelishMix, the film's Super Bowl trailer (dubbed \"The Big Game Trailer\") clocked 94.1\u00a0million views across social media in the 24-hour period following the game; it was the third most viewed trailer that aired at the event, behind *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (134.1\u00a0million views) and *The Flash* (97.4\u00a0million).[154] It was the highest-viewed trailer which did not debut at the event,[154] but its view count was down from the 110.9\u00a0million views received by *F9*'s Super Bowl trailer in 2020, prior to that film's eventual delay. According to unnamed sources reporting to *Variety*, the first trailer accumulated an estimated 295 million views globally within the first 72 hours of release;[146] Instagram drove nearly 30% of views, followed by TikTok (25%), Facebook (22%), YouTube (18%) and Twitter (6%), with a majority of viewership coming in from international territories. *Fast X* also trended as the top topic on Twitter in the U.S. immediately after the trailer debut.[146] Similar to other *Fast & Furious* releases, Hot Wheels announced a themed basic assortment of cars set to feature in *Fast X*, which is set to be released with the film.[155]\n\n\nOn March 14, 2023, the official theatrical poster was released; writing for *Collider*, Aidan King positively reviewed the poster, saying the vehicles placed around the characters are similar to a \"high-octane drag race\", indicating a return to the franchise's history as car-oriented films. He also noted the characters \"loom above the drag [race] scene\", referencing the franchise's thematic shift away from car culture.[156] Two featurettes were released, first on March 31 and then on April 7, 2023, with the main cast giving a behind-the-scenes look (with previously unseen footage) at the production of the film.[157][158] An additional featurette highlighting Diesel and Perry's characters was released on May 5, with the pair and Leterrier providing commentary.[159]\n\n\nOn April 19, the second full-length trailer and the film's official synopsis was released; it was generally praised by critics for its action and Momoa's presentation.[160] On May 2, a character trailer featuring Diesel and Rodriguez, titled \"Fast X: Open Road\", was released; writing for */Film*, Bill Bria described it as \"reflective\". The trailer featured elements of Max Richter's \"On the Nature of Daylight\" and Dinah Washington's contributions from \"This Bitter Earth\", which Bria said \"lent even more gravitas to the Dom/Letty highlight reel\". He further praised the combination, stating \"visuals so nakedly frivolous and music so achingly earnest\" created \"an exquisite tension\".[161] Two days later, the free to play 8-bit style game *Fast X: Let's Race* was launched online. The game features multiple top-down race courses set in the film's locations of Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, and Rome.[162] Diesel and Rodriguez then appeared in promotional spots at the 2023 Miami Grand Prix,[163] while in the United Kingdom, the film partnered with the Capital radio network to launch a competition for a listener to win a trip to Rome.[164] The extended four and a half-minute final trailer was released on May 15.[165]\n\n\nOn May 16, Philips announced a partnership with Universal Pictures in the Philippines, where one could win tickets alongside purchases of an Evnia gaming monitor.[166] Universal also partnered with Frito-Lay's Ruffles to create limited-edition *Fast X* potato chips, which come with raffle tickets where fans could win a ticket; a lucky prize included the 2023 Dodge Charger R/T.[167]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* premiered on May 12, 2023, at the Colosseum in Rome.[168] It was initially scheduled for release on April 2, 2021,[169] but was postponed to April 7, 2023, and finally May 19.[170] These shifts were reportedly made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to *F9*'s eventual postponement to June 2021 that caused *Fast X* to be indefinitely delayed.[171][172] It was widely released in IMAX and other premium large formats.[173] The film was cleared for release in China on March 28, 2023, marking one of the first large American films released in the country in 2023; *Fast & Furious* films have grossed over $1.2\u00a0billion in China since the release of *Fast & Furious 6* (2013), and was one of the first countries where *F9* (2021) was released, being five weeks ahead of its domestic release.[174]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* was released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on premium video on demand on June 9, 2023;[175] on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 8;[176] and on Peacock on September 15.[177] Physical copies contain an audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, a blooper reel, and two music videos.[176]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* has grossed $146\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $568.5\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $714.4 million.[4][5] Prior to its release, *TheWrap* estimated the film would need to gross $800\u2013850\u00a0million worldwide in order to turn a profit.[178] *Variety* later reported that the film \"barely crawled into the black\" but would post a modest profit for the studio.[179]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, tickets went on sale at midnight on February 9, 2023, a day prior to the premiere of the trailer.[173] According to a Fandango study, which surveyed over 6,000 ticket buyers between February and March 2023, *Fast X* was revealed to be the sixth-most anticipated film of the summer.[180] In April 2023, box office projections estimated that the film would gross $65\u201375\u00a0million in its opening weekend.[181] By the week of its release, estimates had been lowered to $60\u00a0million.[182] The film made $28\u00a0million on its first day, including $7.5\u00a0million from Thursday previews. It went on to debut to $67\u00a0million from 4,046 theaters, topping the box office.[183] Writing for *TheWrap*, Jeremy Fuster predicted that *Fast X* may be less profitable than some of its predecessors, citing the film's sudden increased overall production budget (at 70% larger than *F9*) and the expected large marketing budget.[100] In its second weekend, the film made $23\u00a0million (dropping 66%), finishing second behind newcomer *The Little Mermaid*.[184] In its third weekend, *Fast X* finished in fourth place and made $9.2\u00a0million for a drop of 61%.[185]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, tickets went on sale on May 5.[186] The film was projected to gross around $280\u00a0million worldwide in its opening weekend, including about $220\u00a0million from 84 countries.[182] Like its domestic debut, the film ended up slightly out-performing projections, making $252.7\u00a0million internationally and a total of $320\u00a0million worldwide. It was the sixth-best opening weekend for a studio film since 2019, and second-biggest non-superhero title (behind *Avatar: The Way of Water*).[187] Its largest markets were China ($78\u00a0million), Mexico ($16\u00a0million), France ($9.6\u00a0million), and Brazil ($9.6\u00a0million).[188] The film set records for the highest-opening weekend release for a foreign film in Pakistan, with 19.98 crore ($701,052).[189]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 310 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"As irredeemably silly as it is satisfyingly self-aware, *Fast X* should rev the engines of longtime fans while leaving many newcomers in neutral.\"[1] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[190] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as *F9* and the first film but below other installments. PostTrak reported filmgoers gave the film an 82% positive score, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.[183]\n\n\nMomoa's performance was widely praised by critics; Eric Eisenberg of *CinemaBlend* said Momoa \"plays Dante like [the] *Fast & Furious* version of The Joker\", concluding it was a \"delightful\" portrayal of a \"gleeful psychopath\". Liam Crowley of *Comicbook* seconded this view, calling Momoa \"hilarious\", while *Screen Rant*'s Joseph Deckelmeier said Momoa brings \"magic\" to a performance which \"oozes charisma\".[191] In a mixed review, Brian Truitt of *USA Today* also praised Momoa's performance but criticized the screenplay, saying, \"Laws of physics are pummeled at length and all logic is shot out of a cannon [with] its bizarre character choices and decisions\".[192] The *Chicago Sun-Times*'s Richard Roeper gave the film two out of four stars and was more critical of Momoa's performance, writing, \"[He] comes across as more of a preening, performance-art, sociopathic clown than a truly menacing villain\".[193] Clarisse Loughrey of *The Independent* said that an \"arbitrary\" plot serves a \"biblically-scaled soap opera [that] happily rewrites the laws of gravity and physiology to put a smile on its audience's faces\", and praised the cast performances, namely Momoa's.[194]\n\n\nIn a less positive review, Charles Pulliam-Moore of *The Verge* criticized the return of former characters, saying the film has \"convoluted twists and turns\" which contribute to making it feel \"exciting, but airless\". He also wrote the large cast made its characters \"feel like souped-up cameos meant to remind you of the past rather than figures organically existing in the present\u2014especially when they just pop up out of nowhere, which happens more often than you'd expect\". He also criticized the screenplay, saying \"[Dom and Dante's] conflict ends up feeling like something that was mapped out on paper, but was not crafted tightly enough for on-screen\".[195] This was echoed by *Den of Geek*'s Don Kay, who lamented the lack of character beats for the supporting cast and the lack of stakes in the plot, although he praised Cena's performance, writing, \"He plays to his comedic strengths and gets by on his sheer charisma\".[196]\n\n\nAlison Willmore of *Vulture* criticized Leterrier's direction, writing the film \"plays like it was made by an AI versed in the existing [films] but not quite up to spitting out something coherent itself\" and called its plot \"deliriously unwieldy\". She also criticized its cast as being bloated and its dialogue as feeling \"engineered to be clipped and used without context for promotional purposes\", concluding watching *Fast X* \"feels like sustaining a head injury\".[197] Writing for *Slant*, Greg Nussen criticized the acting performances and cinematography, calling it \"overly lit [with] ultra-saturated images\" and wrote that the film was \"closer to fan fiction or self-parody than the real deal\".[198] Writing for *The Wall Street Journal*, Kyle Smith also criticized Leterrier's direction as overzealous, saying, \"Leterrier rarely misses an opportunity to shred the storyline [to] end up with confetti, serving ridiculous action scenes [that] require much narrative corner-cutting\".[199]\n\n\nIn a scathing review, *GameSpot*'s Phil Owen said the film possesses \"blurry backgrounds and weird close-up shots\", negatively comparing it to low-budget films, and called the editing \"distractingly frenetic\". He also said the storyline \"just rehashed plot threads and set pieces from past [films]\", criticized the ending, and called Diesel's performance a \"full-on parody of himself: [he plays] a bland character\".[200] Kevin Maher of *The Times* called the film a \"jaded and lackadaisical patch-up job\", criticizing the cast performances,[201] while *Rolling Stone*'s Chris Vognar said that the cast (besides Momoa) \"mailed [their] performances in\" and called the film uninspiring, writing, \"*Fast X* feels like it was written by a software program\".[202]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* was nominated in five categories at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards: \"Legacy Ride\" (TRANSIT) for Best Action and Best Music, \"Last Ride\" (AV Squad) for Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer, \"Clash\" (TRANSIT) for Best Sound Editing in a TV Spot (for a Feature Film), and \"Ensemble Shoot\" (AV Squad) for Best Action/Thriller TrailerByte for a Feature Film. It won Best Action TV Spot (for a Feature Film) for \"Ahead\" (AV Squad).[203][204] The film became a runner-up for Best Supporting Actor (Momoa) and received a nomination for Best Stunts at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.[205]\n\n\n\n## Sequels and spin-off[edit]\n\n\nAlthough *Fast X* was reported as the final installment of the franchise, Diesel unveiled two sequels to this film, depending on its performance. Leterrier considered whether the eleventh film to be the franchise's last installment or not.[206] The relative success of *Fast X* sought a sequel, scheduled for release on April 4, 2025.[177][g] Development on both sequels were suspended due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[210]\n\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Justin Lin, the film's original director, left production in April 2022, after a week through principal photography, due to creative differences.

Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist credited with being the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project\u2014the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography *American Prometheus* by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of Oppenheimer, with the story predominantly focusing on his studies, his direction of the Manhattan Project during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. The film also stars Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife \"Kitty\", Matt Damon as head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's communist lover Jean Tatlock. The ensemble supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\n\n\nThe film was announced in September 2021 after Universal Pictures won a bidding war for Nolan's screenplay, following Nolan's conflict with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest of the cast joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production was under way by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. *Oppenheimer* was filmed in a combination of IMAX 65\u00a0mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. Like his previous works, Nolan made extensive use of practical effects, with minimal computer-generated imagery used to perfect the former. Editing was handled by Jennifer Lame, and the score was composed by Ludwig G\u00f6ransson. The film is Nolan's fourth to receive an R-rating in the United States, preceded by *Following* (1998), *Memento* (2000) and *Insomnia* (2002).\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal. Its simultaneous release with Warner Bros.'s *Barbie* led to the Barbenheimer cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film received critical acclaim and grossed over $950 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film, and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Upset with the demanding Blackett, Oppenheimer leaves him a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr recommends that Oppenheimer instead study theoretical physics at G\u00f6ttingen. \n\n\nHe completes his PhD there and meets fellow scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled Communist Party USA member who later commits suicide.\n\n\nIn December 1938, nuclear fission is discovered, which Oppenheimer realizes could be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis' potentially completing their nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg. \n\n\nHe assembles a scientific team including Rabi and Edward Teller in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also collaborates with scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could possibly trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that ignites the atmosphere. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller's proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is swiftly rejected. He attempts to leave the project, though Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\n\n\nFollowing Adolf Hitler's death in 1945, some Project scientists question the bomb's relevance, while Oppenheimer believes it will end the ongoing war in the Pacific and save Allied lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be bombed, forcing Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities, and urges restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman curtly dismisses. \n\n\nAs an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for having publicly humiliated him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes, and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonated their own bomb. He also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.\n\n\nIn 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However, it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited, and Groves' and other associates' testimony is twisted against him. \n\n\nTeller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. The board revokes Oppenheimer's clearance, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall, resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination.\n\n\nIn 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. A flashback reveals that Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Oppenheimer instead expressed his somber belief that he had started a chain reaction that might destroy the world.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![Actor Cillian Murphy at a press conference for The Party at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival in 2017](image)\n![Portrait of J.

After that project failed to materialize, and the book was optioned by various filmmakers over the fifteen years following, the authors grew pessimistic about seeing their work adapted to the screen. At one point Oliver Stone was offered the opportunity to direct, but turned it down because he \"couldn't find my way to its essence\".[51] In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.[52]\n\n\nNolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading *American Prometheus*.[53] In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film *Tenet* (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave the director a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed the physicist \"wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done\". Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\" in contrast to *Tenet*, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.[54][2]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with the studio on each one of his films starting with *Insomnia* (2002), was outraged with the decision as he had been a proponent of film theaters.[55] In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros.[56] By mid-2021, the filmmaker had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project.[2] Nolan had previously supported the studio's decision to give *Wonder Woman 1984* (2020) a simultaneous release, stating that he perceived that situation to have been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of *Tenet*.[57][58]\n\n\nIn September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film set during World War II about Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star.[59][60] Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios for the project, including Sony, Universal, Paramount, and Apple.[61][62] According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process in relation to the replacement of CEO and chairman Jim Gianopulos with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases.[62]\n\n\nNolan ended up going to Universal because he had previously worked with Donna Langley, chairwoman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, on an unsuccessful attempt to make a film version of the UK television series *The Prisoner*. He was unable to \"'crack' the adaptation\", but they stayed in touch.[63] Langley agreed with Nolan's strong stance in favor of traditional film exhibition in theaters. Therefore, Universal agreed to finance and distribute *Oppenheimer*, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022.[64] The studio also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million, an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film's first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the film's opening in which Universal could not release another new film.[62][2]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n![Christopher Nolan at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.](image)Writer, director, and producer Christopher Nolan\n*Oppenheimer* is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale.[53][65][66] He began developing the script after he completed *Tenet* and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years.[53] A major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\".[67] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[68] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\".[69][67] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[70] Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.[71]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. Which, given that I've made three Batman films, is saying a lot.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Christopher Nolan, *Total Film*[72]\n\nNolan began by trying to find the \"thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey\" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life.[54] As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate\".[73] Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in *Amadeus* (1984).[67]\n\n\nAnother critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a \"massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to have a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\".[71]\n\n\nNolan first became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric \"How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?\" in the Sting song \"Russians\" (1985).[67] He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's *The Aviator* (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the *Oppenheimer* script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[72]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, the actor did what he summarized as \"an awful lot of reading\" on Oppenheimer's life and had also been inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s.[74][8][67] Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted and was excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room.[75] Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance.[76] Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on *Interstellar* (2014).[53] As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.[53]\n\n\nThe casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on.[35] Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4\u00a0million in lieu of their usual $10\u201320\u00a0million upfront salary.[77] Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper.[78] Downey would later describe *Oppenheimer* as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date.[79] Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like.[78] Asked to play the part of Leslie Groves, Damon\u2014who had appeared in Nolan's *Interstellar*\u2014was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife in couples therapy, but signed on to *Oppenheimer* as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film.[80] Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in *Licorice Pizza* (2021).[81] Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school.[67]\n\n\nIt is Nolan's first film since *Batman Begins* (2005) to not feature Michael Caine. When asked about Caine's absence from the film, Nolan stated, \"He's with us in spirit, but not an actual actor. No, no. He wasn't able to join us for this one. But he's always with us in spirit, and I've had the most wonderful collaboration with him over the years.\"[82][83]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFilming took place at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022.\n\nPre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists.[84][85] Another casting call was held in February.[86]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico,[87] and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer.[76][22] The original shooting schedule had set aside approximately 85 days for principal photography.[88] During pre-production, it had become clear there was no way to shoot a feature film for $100 million over that many days on location all over the United States.[88] To free up money in the film's budget for location shooting in California and New Jersey and for construction of high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule to 55 days.[88] Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as \"insane\".[88]\n\n\nGary Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for \"one scene, a page and a half\".[50] Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you\".[54]\n\n\nThe film used a combination of IMAX 65\u00a0mm and 65 mm large-format film.[8] It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the film.[89][90] Van Hoytema used 50\u00a0mm and 80\u00a0mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses. Said Van Hoytema, \"When shooting our close-ups, we didn't want the camera to be six feet away from our subject. We wanted to be much tighter, so that you really feel the perspective and the intimacy. Also, I knew we would be filming in low-light situations and would need to shoot at T1.4 rather than a T4.\"[91] Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras for macro photography and microphotography to record the film's miniature effects.[92] In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[93] Filming also occurred in California,[49] primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.[94] Scenes set in the city of Berkeley itself were filmed in Pasadena.[95]\n\n\nDuring a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks.[87] Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch.[87] It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days.[87] The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos.[95] Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022.[87] Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos.[87] Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer during filming.[96] The New York hotel scenes were shot in Albuquerque's Old Post Office building, while the Washington, D.C. scenes were shot in state government buildings in the state capital of Santa Fe.[95]\n\n\nFilming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics.[97] When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb.[2] Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him.[2] The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95] The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95] A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective.[98][99] Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects,[100] and used practical effects to achieve \"real-world imagery\".[101] Filming wrapped in May 2022.[102]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nDuring post-production, editing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited *Tenet*.[8] While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed \"character passes\" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters.[67] Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements,[103] marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor,[104] who stated that the film utilized mostly \"invisible\" visual effects through \"'in-camera' special effects created on set\".[105] Digital compositing was used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.[106]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oppenheimer (soundtrack)\n\nLudwig G\u00f6ransson composed the score for the film, after doing so for Nolan's previous film, *Tenet*.[8] G\u00f6ransson's score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023.[107] It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13.[108][109] Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with G\u00f6ransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from \"the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds\".[67]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer*'s teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29\u00a0a.m. (MDT) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings of *Nope* before being posted online on Universal's social media profiles.[110] *Empire* commented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: \"heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight\".[111] In December 2022, two trailers for the film premiered in front of *Avatar: The Way of Water*, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online.[112][113] In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.[114]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023,[115] followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13,[116] and the American premiere at AMC Loews Lincoln Square in New York City on July 17.[117] Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early,[116] and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere.[117] SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like *Oppenheimer*.[118] *Oppenheimer* was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[8][119] In addition to standard digital cinemas, it will be also released in various film formats including IMAX 70\u00a0mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).[120]\n\n\nThe film was released on the same day as *Barbie*, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release *Barbie* on the same day as *Oppenheimer* was made in order to deplete ticket sales of *Oppenheimer* as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal.[121] Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences,[122] and how they should be viewed as a double feature.[123] The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\",[124] and was labeled as counterprogramming during a summer of \"entertainment industry meltdown\".[125] Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"[126]\n\n\nAs of March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[127] *Oppenheimer* had also been banned by Russia's Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of \"preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values\".[128]\n\n\nIn Japan, the only country to have been attacked by nuclear bombs, the film is yet to have a release date. In late June 2023, a Universal Pictures spokesperson told *Variety* that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets\". *Variety* also pointed out that it is not uncommon for American films to be released in Japan months after the theatrical debut in the United States.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Classifications and censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for \"some sexuality, nudity, and language\", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult guardian. It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating since *Insomnia* (2002).[130] In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong sex and a suicide scene\".[131] In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification for \"strong language and sex\", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film.[132] In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.[133][134][135]\n\n\nIn India, *Oppenheimer* was released with all scenes depicting nudity, sex and cigarette smoking being censored, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time.[136] The audio of the scene in which Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\", while the two have intercourse, remained intact.[137] As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.[138]\n\n\nThe Hindutva was angered by the scene and demanded its removal.[139] Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a \"direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\", and demanded its removal from all releases of *Oppenheimer* across the world.[137] On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj, told *The Times of India* that \"The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation & the physical act is just a natural mechanical act.\"[140]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* will be released on 4K Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray and DVD formats including digital on November 21, 2023.[141]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nAs of November\u00a014, 2023[update], *Oppenheimer* has grossed $325.3\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $625.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $950.7\u00a0million.[3][4] It is the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time, behind *Joker* (2019).[142][143] In September 2023, *Oppenheimer* became the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, surpassing *Bohemian Rhapsody* (2018).[144][145]\n\n\nBy August 2023, *Oppenheimer* had become the highest-grossing film ever to not reach the top spot at the domestic box office, though in its sixth weekend it topped the worldwide box office with a total of $38.12 million, surpassing *Barbie* for the first time.[146] It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassing *Dunkirk* (2017), also a Nolan film.[147][148][149][150] Additionally, *Oppenheimer* became one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $183 million[151] (approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70\u00a0mm prints.[152] The film was booked to be rereleased in IMAX theatres on November 3, including six IMAX 70mm prints, as these theatres reported selling out during the film\u2019s initial release.[151]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *Oppenheimer* was released alongside *Barbie*.[153] The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day.[154] After grossing $33\u00a0million on its first day (including $10.5\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million,[155] finishing second behind *Barbie* and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama. 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18\u201334 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for *Oppenheimer*), a combined total of 18.5\u00a0million people.[156] The film's opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from *The Dark Knight* trilogy.[157] It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behind *The Passion of the Christ* (2004) and *American Sniper* (2014).[158] The film made $46.2\u00a0million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind *Barbie*.[159][160] The film made $28.7\u00a0million in its third weekend, finishing third behind *Barbie* and newcomer *Meg 2: The Trench*.[161] On August 16, *Oppenheimer* surpassed *Sing* (2016) to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office.[162][163] During its fourth weekend, the film made $18.8 million (a drop of 35%) rising back up to second place.[164] In its fifth and sixth weekends, the film grossed $10.7 million and $9 million (a drop of 43% and 16% respectively), finishing in third and fourth place at the box office and passing $300 million domestically in its sixth weekend.[164]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film grossed $98\u00a0million in its opening weekend.[165] The following weekend, *Oppenheimer* earned $77.1\u00a0million, dropping by just 21% to become Nolan's highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey.[166] In its third weekend, *Oppenheimer* grossed $52.8 million (a drop of 31%)[167] and $32 million in its fourth weekend.[168] The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[169][170] As of September 10, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($72\u00a0million), Germany ($46.9\u00a0million), China ($46.8 million), France ($40.1 million) and Australia ($25.9\u00a0million).[171]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. were praised.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim.[a] Critics praised *Oppenheimer* primarily for its screenplay, the performances of the cast (particularly Murphy and Downey), and the visuals;[182][183][184][185] it was frequently cited as one of the best films of Nolan,[186][187][178] and of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[182] *Hindustan Times* reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century.[188] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 471 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"*Oppenheimer* marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals.\"[189] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[190] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[156]\n\n\nRichard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* awarded *Oppenheimer* a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as \"magnificent\" and \"one of the best films of the 21st century\".[191] *The A.V. Club*'s Matthew Jackson deemed it a \"masterpiece\", adding that \"it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain\".[192] *Empire*'s Dan Jolin labeled it a \"masterfully constructed character study\", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography.[193] Peter Suderman writing for *Reason* magazine said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of \"fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great *and* terrible. *Oppenheimer* isn't just a movie\u2014it's a warning.\"[194]\n\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz, writing for *RogerEbert.com* gave *Oppenheimer* a full four stars rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character, and the film's technical achievements, concluding: \"As a physical experience, *Oppenheimer* is something else entirely\u2014it's hard to say exactly what, and that's what's so fascinating about it\".[195] Peter Travers described the film as a \"monumental achievement\" and \"one of the best films you'll see anywhere\".[196] Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", adding that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of *The Dark Knight* trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of *Memento*, *Inception* and *Tenet*.[197] *IGN* critic Siddhant Adlakha gave *Oppenheimer* 10/10, describing it as \"a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller\" and Nolan's most \"abstract\" work yet.[198]\n\n\nSaibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and stated: \"*Oppenheimer*, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavor and ambition\".[199] In August 2023, it ranked number 3 on *Collider*'s list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" writing that Nolan \"explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using the Greek myth of Dante [*sic*] as an inspiration, *Oppenheimer* makes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again.\"[200]\n\n\nDespite praising the film's themes and performances, CNN's Brian Lowry believed that \"Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment\".[201] While acknowledging the contribution of \"American scientists and American enterprise\", Brett Mason noted that the film omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans that ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: \"Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest.\"[202] Writing for the *Los Angeles Times*, Justin Chang staunchly defended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying \"representational completists\" by detouring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \"Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence\".[203]\n\n\n\n#### Accuracy and omissions[edit]\n\n\nThe film was noted for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events.[204] Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film, since he did not know how significant it would become; the study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time, not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\", but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.[204][205]\n\n\nThe scene where Oppenheimer poisons his professor's apple is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life.[206] In the film, Oppenheimer is depicted as putting potassium cyanide in the apple before having a change of heart the next day, and then narrowly preventing the apple from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple, or had any involvement in the incident.[204] Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends,[207] but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened.[204] Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to Arthur Compton, not Einstein.[204]\n\n\nIn addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the hydrogen bomb by the United States. Scott Sagan describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence to constrain the nuclear arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union as a \"broader tragedy\" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy, but he called the production highly accurate otherwise for a \"Hollywood movie\".[208] Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites, such as Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were not shown.[205] Most of them, overseen by General Leslie Groves, focused on producing the nuclear explosives.[209] In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.[210]\n\n\n\n#### Influence[edit]\n\n\nThe renewed attention to the site and associated nuclear testing encouraged the United States Congress to revise the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (1990), which provided compensation programs for people affected by radiation and nuclear testing during the Cold War, known as \"Downwinders\" and primarily consisting of the Navajo Nation. The United States Senate approved amendments to accommodate additional services to people in New Mexico, but it has not passed US Congress as the House of Representatives had not yet debated its inclusion as part of the national defense bill for the 2024 Fiscal Year.[211]\n\n\n\n#### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Nominee(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Golden Trailer Awards | June 29, 2023\n | Best Drama\n | \"Secrets\" (Trailer Park, Inc.)\n | Won\n | [212][213] |\n| Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer\n | Won\n |\n| Best Sound Editing\n | Won\n |\n| Best Thriller\n | \"Lightmaker\" (Inside Job)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Drama TV Spot (for a Feature FIlm)\n | \"Charge\" (Inside Job)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Thriller TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound Editing in a TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards | June 30, 2023 | Most Anticipated Film\n | *Oppenheimer* | Runner-up\n | [214] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | November 15, 2023 | Best Original Score \u2014 Feature Film | Ludwig G\u00f6ransson | Nominated\n | [215] |\n| Grammy Awards | February 4, 2024 | Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media | Pending\n | [216] |\n| Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella | Ludwig G\u00f6ransson (for \"Can You Hear the Music\") | Pending\n |\n| Best Instrumental Composition | Pending\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films about nuclear issues\n* List of World War II films since 1990\n* *Oppenheimer*, a 1980 TV series about Oppenheimer, portrayed by Sam Waterston\n* *Fat Man and Little Boy*, a 1989 film about the Manhattan Project\n* *Doctor Atomic*, a 2005 opera about Oppenheimer, composed by John Adams\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Oppenheimer* (15)\".

Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, DeLuca Marshall, and Marc Platt Productions, it is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1989 animated film of the same name, which itself is loosely based on the 1837 fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The film stars singer Halle Bailey in the title role, alongside Jonah Hauer-King, Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina, Jacob Tremblay, Noma Dumezweni, Art Malik, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy. The plot follows the mermaid princess Ariel, who is fascinated with the human world; after saving Prince Eric from a shipwreck, she makes a deal with the sea witch Ursula to walk on land. \n\n\nPlans for a remake of 1989's *The Little Mermaid* were confirmed in May 2016. In December 2017, Disney announced Marshall was being courted to direct the film. Bailey, Hauer-King, McCarthy, Bardem, Diggs, Tremblay, Awkwafina, and the rest of the cast joined between July and November 2019. Production was expected to begin in London between late March and early April 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, before ultimately took place from January to July 2021, primarily at Pinewood Studios in England and on the island of Sardinia, Italy. Composer Alan Menken returned to augment the score and write new songs alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda, who serves as a producer with Platt, John DeLuca, and Marshall. The film is dedicated to the late Howard Ashman, who co-produced and co-wrote the songs from the original film. The film is Disney's second-most-expensive to date.\n\n\n*The Little Mermaid* premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on May 8, 2023,[8] and was released in the United States on May 26. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the cast and the musical sequences, but criticized the visual effects and character design. The film has grossed over $569 million worldwide against a total production budget of $297 million, becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2023 and the seventh-highest-grossing remake by Disney.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nAriel is a mermaid princess and the youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of the merpeople of Atlantica. She is fascinated with the human world despite never having seen it, as Triton forbids all merfolk from surfacing there after Ariel's mother was killed by a human.\n\n\nOne night, Ariel sees fireworks above the ocean and surfaces to see them better. They come from the ship of Eric, the prince of a nearby island. When a storm arrives, the ship crashes against rocks, forcing all to go for the lifeboats. Ariel rescues Eric, brings him to shore, and sings with her siren voice to help save his life. She flees before he can regain full consciousness.\n\n\nNoticing Ariel's absent-minded behavior, Triton questions his advisor Sebastian the crab, who reveals that she saved a human. Outraged, Triton travels to Ariel's grotto to confront her; when she refuses to swear to never return to the surface, he destroys her collection of human objects. Ariel is later approached by two moray eels sent by the sea witch Ursula, Triton's estranged sister and Ariel's aunt, who was banished from Atlantica 15 years prior.\n\n\nAt Ursula's lair, Ariel is presented with a deal: she will turn into a human for three days, during which she must receive \"true love's kiss\" to remain human permanently. If Ariel fails, she will transform back into a mermaid and Ursula will claim her. To become human, Ariel must give up her tail, the ability to breathe underwater, and her siren voice, the last of which Ursula will keep in a nautilus shell. Ariel accepts the deal. After receiving human legs, she is taken to the surface by Sergeant Major Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian. In the human world, she is rescued and taken to Eric's castle. Eric, who has been searching for the woman who saved his life, rushes to meet Ariel. However, her lack of voice has him immediately turning away, though he does allow Ariel to stay in the castle for as long as she wants. While exploring the castle, Ariel finds Eric's collection of items he accumulated over his travels. Eric spends time with her poring over his collection.\n\n\nThe next day, Eric takes Ariel sightseeing around the kingdom. Sebastian, who has followed Ariel, realizes that Ursula has put a cheat in the spell that is causing Ariel to forget that she needs to kiss Eric. Along with Scuttle, a northern gannet, and Flounder, Sebastian takes it upon himself to get the pair to kiss. They are almost successful but are thwarted by Ursula's eels. Enraged by the close call, Ursula turns into a human and uses Ariel's siren voice to hypnotize Eric. Back at Atlantica, Triton has the kingdom search for Ariel and begins to regret the way he treated her.\n\n\nThe next morning, Ariel and her friends discover that Eric will be announcing his engagement to \"Vanessa\" (Ursula's alter ego) later that day. Ariel rushes to the engagement party, confronts Ursula, and breaks the shell. She gains back her voice, and the enchantment on Eric is broken. However, before they can kiss, the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Reverting to her original form, Ursula drags Ariel back into the ocean.\n\n\nWanting to save Ariel, Triton confronts Ursula. However, the deal that she made with Ariel is unbreakable. Triton trades himself for Ariel and is turned to dust by the eels, much to her horror. Ursula claims Triton's trident just before Eric arrives; in the ensuing melee, Ursula accidentally kills her eels. Enraged, she uses the trident to grow in size and summons a storm to threaten Ariel and Eric. As Eric distracts Ursula, Ariel gets on a surfaced ship and impales Ursula with its splintered bowsprit. Once Ursula dies, Triton comes back to life; he and Ariel recognize the other's sacrifice for them.\n\n\nAriel returns home, where she is unhappy without Eric. On Sebastian's advice, Triton transforms Ariel into a human permanently, and she marries Eric. The pair decide to travel together, with the blessing of both their parents and the support of people from both their worlds.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of The Little Mermaid characters\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Top row:** Halle Bailey, Jonah Hauer-King, Melissa McCarthy, and Javier Bardem portray Ariel, Eric, Ursula and King Triton  \n**Bottom row:** Noma Dumezweni plays Queen Selina, while Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, and Awkwafina voice Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle\n\n* Halle Bailey as Ariel, a curious, adventurous, and headstrong mermaid princess and King Triton's youngest daughter who is fascinated with the human world. Bailey was announced to have been cast on July 3, 2019.[9] In the early stages of the film's development, Lindsay Lohan expressed interest in playing the role.[10] Zendaya was reported to have been offered the part in August 2018,[11] but she herself eventually stated that this was \"just a rumor\".[12] Bailey was the first to audition for the role[13] after Rob Marshall saw her perform Donny Hathaway's 1972 single \"Where Is the Love\" at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.[14] According to Marshall, hundreds of other girls also tried out for the part,[15] but she \"set the bar so high that nobody surpassed it.\"[16]\n* Jonah Hauer-King as Eric, an adventurer and free-spirited human prince whom Ariel falls in love with after saving him from drowning. Hauer-King was announced to have been cast on November 12, 2019.[17] Hundreds of candidates auditioned for the role,[18] including actors Asher Angel,[19] Gavin Leatherwood,[20] Christian Navarro,[21] Jack Whitehall,[22] and Cameron Cuffe, with the latter, along with Hauer-King, doing a screen test alongside Bailey.[23] Harry Styles was in early negotiations to play the part,[24] but ultimately turned it down[25] in favor of doing a concert tour.[26] Marshall later elaborated that Styles also refused because he wanted to do darker, non-musical roles.[18] Hauer-King described his character as \"restless and inquisitive about where he is in the world, like Ariel... He's quite isolated and sensitive.\"[27]\n* Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, a treacherous and conniving sea witch and King Triton's estranged sister, with whom Ariel makes a deal to become a human, which is secretly part of Ursula's plan to conquer Atlantica. McCarthy was announced to have been cast on June 28, 2019.[28] She described her character as \"so funny. There's wit, there's manipulation. She's a great broad and at the same time, I have to think about what armor does she put in? And I don't think her mental health is great.\"[29] Lizzo also auditioned for the role.[30]\n\t+ Jessica Alexander as Vanessa, Ursula's human alter ego, which she uses to sabotage her deal with Ariel. Alexander was announced to have been cast on March 1, 2021.[31] She described her character as \"a seductress, a temptress, the definition of a femme fatale and a sexy female villain.\"[32] Of her casting, director Rob Marshall stated it was a conscious decision to cast a relatively unknown actress as Vanessa since McCarthy was already portraying Ursula. He also said: \"She's just a beautiful, beautiful actress, and she went there. It's sort of rare for someone that beautiful and charismatic to be able to then turn into the sea witch literally in front of you and just lose it. It was exciting to see that change.\"[33] Alexander enjoyed playing the role, commenting that she \"love[s] being demonic, and just going crazy on screen, so this was a perfect opportunity for that\".[34] Kacey Musgraves was also considered for the role.[35]\n* Javier Bardem as King Triton, Ariel's strict and overprotective father and the ruler of Atlantica who is prejudiced against humans due to the death of his wife at the hands of one of them. Bardem was announced to have been cast on July 17, 2019.[36] He described his character as \"a little bit less grumpy than the original because we were intending to bring more conflict to his behavior, like his fear and insecurity as a father. Being scared of letting his last daughter leave home ends up translating into being angry or too controlling.\"[37]\n* Noma Dumezweni as Queen Selina, Eric's adoptive mother and the ruler of a Caribbean island kingdom. She is a new character for the film.[18] Dumezweni was announced to have been cast on January 5, 2021.[38] She described her character as a \"loving queen and a mother queen and a parent and a land lover learning about herself through letting go of her children.\"[39]\n* Art Malik as Sir Grimsby, the prime minister of Selina's kingdom and Eric's loyal confidant who acts as a father figure to him.[40]\n* Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, a loyal fiddler crab and King Triton's majordomo who watches over Ariel. Diggs was announced to have been cast on October 8, 2019.[41][42]\n* Jacob Tremblay as Flounder, an anxious yet noble sergeant major who is Ariel's best friend. Tremblay was announced to have been cast on July 1, 2019.[43]\n* Awkwafina as Scuttle, a dimwitted northern gannet and a friend of Ariel's to whom she provides inaccurate descriptions of any human/surface world object Ariel finds. The character is portrayed as a female diving bird instead of a male seagull as in the original to feature the character in underwater scenes. Awkwafina was announced to have been cast on July 1, 2019.[44]\n\n\nAdditionally, Martina Laird appears as Lashana, one of the maids in Eric's castle, who is based on Carlotta from the animated film; Emily Coates appears as Rosa, a young girl who works as a maid in Eric's castle; Christopher Fairbank and John Dagleish appear as Hawkins and Mulligan, two of Eric's shipmates; Jude Akuwudike appears as Joshua, a fisherman who discovers Ariel in her human form; and Russell Balogh and Adrian Christopher appear as two of King Triton's guards.[45] Also appearing as the daughters of Triton and Ariel's sisters (renamed for the film) are Lorena Andrea as Perla, Simone Ashley as Indira, Karolina Conchet as Mala, Sienna King as Tamika, Kajsa Mohammar as Karina, and Nathalie Sorrell as Caspia.[46][47][48] Eric's Old English Sheepdog, Max, is portrayed by dogs Gary and Edna, with the latter being uncredited.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFlotsam and Jetsam, Ursula's green moray eel minions appear. Jodi Benson, the original voice of Ariel in the animated film, cameos as a market vendor who hands Ariel a fork during her tour of the kingdom.[49][50][51]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDirector and co-producer Rob Marshall (left) and screenwriter David Magee\n\nIn May 2016, Walt Disney Pictures began developing a live-action adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\".[52] Three months later, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Marc Platt signed on to produce the film, which was confirmed to be a remake of the Disney's 1989 animated film of the same name.[53] On December 6, 2017, it was reported that Rob Marshall was being courted by the Walt Disney Company to direct the film, while Jane Goldman would serve as screenwriter.[54] On December 5, 2018, Marshall revealed that he, along with John DeLuca and Marc Platt were hired to begin developing the project for film adaptation, and said that \"John and [Marshall] have begun our work trying to explore it and figure it out\", as he felt that \"it's a very complicated movie to take from animation to live-action. Live-action's a whole other world so you have to be very careful about how that's done, but so we're starting the exploration phase\".[55] Later in December, Marshall was officially hired as director for the film.[56] During an interview on December 21, 2018, Marshall revealed that the film is in very early stages of development, stating that the studio is trying to explore ways to translate the original film's story into live-action.[57] On July 3, 2019, David Magee, who previously wrote the screenplay for Marshall's *Mary Poppins Returns*, was revealed to have written the script with Goldman.[58] Magee would receive sole credit for the screenplay. On February 10, 2020, Miranda revealed that rehearsals for the film had already begun.[59]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nFilming was originally scheduled to begin in London between late March and early April 2020; however, it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[60][61][62][63] Set photos at Pinewood Studios in London, England leaked a few weeks after the production was shut down, it showed aerial images featuring Prince Eric's ship as well as indoor images of what seemed to be his castle. On July 29, 2020, based on a social media post, Jacob Tremblay began recording his lines for the film.[64] Filming was scheduled to re-commence on August 10, 2020.[65]\nBy November 2020, Disney's new CEO Bob Chapek announced that filming on all films that had been postponed during pandemic shutdowns had resumed filming, and in some cases completed principal photography.[66]\n\n\nIn December 2020, McCarthy stated that she would hopefully begin filming in January 2021.[67] The following month, Diggs discussed the large amount of work he had to do when it came to preparing for and recording dialogue for the role of Sebastian.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cala Moresca in Sardinia, Italy, among the movie's filming locations[69]\nPrincipal photography officially began at Pinewood Studios in Iver, England on January 30, 2021.[70] Filming for McCarthy's scenes eventually began in April 2021.[71] On April 6, it was announced that additional filming would be happening in summer in Sardinia, Italy, for a total of \"roughly three months\".[72] In June 2021, production was temporarily halted due to multiple crew members of the film contracting COVID-19.[73] Filming resumed about a week later and officially wrapped on July 11, 2021.[74][75] On December 30, 2021, Bailey shared some new behind-the-scenes photos of the set, including a glimpse of her portrayal of Ariel. The actress took to Instagram to wrap up her year and shared photos of moments of shooting the film. The first photo showed the film's script, which was blurred to avoid spoilers, but still showed her character name \"Ariel\" in bold print. One photo showed her swimming in Sardinia's waters, while another showed the process of film-making using CGI.[76] In February 2023, Marshall revealed that he hopes post-production work on the film will be completed by March, saying:\n\n\n\n\n> \"I'm very proud of the film. It's the most challenging film I've ever done, for sure. No question\u00a0... Using complicated, cutting-edge techniques to make this work. I don't think anybody's ever done an underwater musical before. I have to say every single moment of the film had to be choreographed in advance so that we could have a flow to the whole piece. It's crazy the apparatuses we worked with from wires to things called tuning forks to teeter-totters. Thank God we had the rehearsal time. You always need it on a musical anyway.\"\n> \n> \u2014\u200aRob Marshall[77][78]\n> \n\n\nOn March 22, 2023, Bailey revealed that she had to spend 13 hours underwater during certain days of filming and that practical water tanks and CGI were used to create the underwater environments, saying \"I pushed myself as far as I've ever pushed myself in life\u00a0... And I feel like the message from [Ariel] was to know that you've always had it in you.\" She also revealed that the film's themes were updated so that it is not put at the forefront that Ariel \"leaves the ocean for a boy\" in response to recent criticism surrounding the portrayal of that desire in the original film. On that, she added \"I'm really excited for my version of the film because we've definitely changed that perspective\u00a0... It's way bigger than that. It's about herself, her purpose, her freedom, her life and what she wants. As women we are amazing, we are independent, we are modern, we are everything and above, and I'm glad that Disney is updating some of those themes.\"[79]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, W\u0113t\u0101 FX, Moving Picture Company and Framestore.[80] DNEG also provided the stereo conversion.[81] For the \"Under the Sea\" sequence, Marshall called it a \"big, massive musical number\" and said that creating the underwater environments involved \"a lot of work in advance with John DeLuca and myself creating these musical sequences, to prep it in advance from storyboards to something called pre-visualization, which is almost like a little mini-animated film, so we know how it flowed and how it worked ... You are creating a world, you're creating creatures, but it's very important to me that it feels real \u2013 you have to believe, you have to care about them, you have to follow their journey.\"[82]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2023, Marshall revealed that his work on Disney's *Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides* (which featured a mermaid character named Tamara) helped influence his work on *The Little Mermaid*, using similar live-action and CGI techniques to bring Ariel, her sisters and King Triton to life. He called it \"a great launching point for us\" and showed his work on *Pirates* to the crew and visual effects team to break down the process. The colorful tails of the merpeople characters were designed by Marshall's frequent costume designer Colleen Atwood, who used real fish as references to make each of the tails of Ariel and her sisters look more distinct from one another, and also designed the costumes for the human characters.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2023, special effects artist Christine Overs filed a lawsuit against the film's producers over an accident that occurred on the film set, in which Christine had a broken wrist. In the lawsuit, Christine seeks compensation of 150,000 euros (US$190,000). Sandcastle Pictures, the Disney-owned production company responsible for filming, has admitted responsibility for the accident but disputes the amount Overs is seeking.[84]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Little Mermaid (2023 soundtrack)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | It has been suggested that this section be merged into *The Little Mermaid (2023 soundtrack)*.

He elaborated that the songs would feature \"some rapping\" in the vein of Miranda's previous works, as well as a closer style to his usual work.[90] Menken also stated that he updated the lyrics to \"Kiss the Girl\" and \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" to reflect modern times.[91]\n\n\nOn September 22, 2021, Menken sat down with Disney's *For Scores* podcast and confirmed that the film will feature four new songs. He also recalled that Miranda was \"*daunted*\" by the prospect of following on in the footsteps of the late Howard Ashman, the lyricist who worked with Menken to write the original film's songs.[92] On November 24, 2021, in an interview with *Collider*, Miranda talked about his admiration for *The Little Mermaid* and how Ashman and Menken helped shape his childhood. He said:\n\n\n\n\n> \"Oh, man. So much of my work on *The Little Mermaid* was that wish fulfillment. I actually didn't write any new songs for Sebastian the Crab because I love his songs so much. I was like, 'I can't. Nope, not me. I can't do it.' I did get to write for some of the other characters in that movie. Every song you love in *The Little Mermaid* is still in *The Little Mermaid*, we just found some new moments to musicalise. That's really tricky.\"\n> \n> \u2014\u200aLin-Manuel Miranda[93]\n> \n\nOn January 20, 2022, Bailey spoke with *Stylecater*, saying that she was so emotional while filming \"Part of Your World\".[94] She said:\n\n\n\n> \"It was really surreal to film. It was really emotional for me. It was three days of intense being all over the place. I was crying the whole time because I was just like, 'What the heck?' We're all connected to that song and it means a lot to each of us.\"\n> \n> \u2014\u200aHalle Bailey\n> \n\n On February 17, 2022, during a podcast interview with *Variety*, Miranda revealed that one of the new songs for the live-action film, \"For the First Time\", will take place when Ariel is on land in her human form. He also revealed that star Daveed Diggs might rap in the film. This was confirmed later on March 31, 2023, by Menken, revealing the title of the new rap song as \"The Scuttlebutt\". He described it as a \"harebrained\" song for Scuttle and Sebastian \"...trying to figure out what's going on because they hear rumors that the prince has decided to marry. They think it must be Ariel but of course it's Ursula in the form of Vanessa. It's all this delicious imagination. Lin's lyrics are to die for.\"[95][96][97][98]\n\n\nMenken then provided more details on the new songs, revealing that the first of the four that was written during the film's development was a solo for Prince Eric, \"Wild Unchartered Waters\", resulting from Marshall wanting \"...a new song for this moment of waves and all the wildness of what's out there in the ocean...[Ariel] represented that to [Prince Eric]; she being the girl who saved his life. Live action films are really a director's medium.\" He then revealed that the fourth song did not make the final cut and was supposed to be a new song for King Triton entitled \"Impossible Child\", as he and the filmmakers felt that it \"dramaturgically\" was not needed, but did say that the song would be released to the public at a later date, possibly on the film's home media release. The song was featured as an additional track on a physical version of the soundtrack released as a HSN exclusive.[99] Some of the lyrics for \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" and \"Kiss the Girl\" were updated as well, with Menken explaining that for \"Kiss the Girl\", it was because \"people have gotten very sensitive about the idea that [Prince Eric] would, in any way, force himself on [Ariel],\" while that for \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", it was because of \"...lines that might make young girls somehow feel that they shouldn't speak out of turn, even though Ursula is clearly manipulating Ariel to give up her voice.\"[100][98]\n\n\nTwo songs from the original film were cut: \"Daughters of Triton\", sung by Ariel's sisters and \"Les Poissons\", sung by the character of Eric's French cook Chef Louis, who also was cut from the film. Menken explained the reasons for cutting the former, saying that it felt \"not needed\" given the new approach the filmmakers gave to the sisters, and that they wanted the film to begin \"with a much more of a live-action feel of the ocean and meeting Ariel, and then we wait a little bit, make you wait until we get to 'Part of Your World.' And I think that was, you know, it was an amazing choice because it just builds the power and anticipation.\"[101] On cutting the latter, Marshall explained \"It's literally a Saturday morning cartoon section. If we had filmed it \u2013 I don't know how we would've filmed it \u2013- it never would have played. It's also a vacation from the story and has nothing to do with the story, so you can't do that in a live-action film.\"[102]\n\n\nThe soundtrack album was made available to pre-save and pre-order on March 13, 2023, and was released digitally on May 19, and on CD and vinyl on May 26, 2023, by Walt Disney Records.[103][104] Bailey's version of \"Part of Your World\" was released as a digital download single on April 26, 2023, one month before the film's release,[105] as well as the Korean version by Danielle of NewJeans.[106] An outtake of \"Impossible Child\", an unused song performed by Javier Bardem, was released as a digital single on September 8, 2023.[107]\n\n\nIn June 2023, the soundtrack reached number 1 on the *Billboard* Top Soundtracks chart, and number 21 on the *Billboard* 200.[108]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*The Little Mermaid* held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on May 8, 2023, followed by the London premiere at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on May 15. It was released theatrically on May 26, 2023, in the United States by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[109][8][110] A sing-along edition of the film was released in theaters on August 25, 2023.[111]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nOn September 9, 2022, Rob Marshall and Halle Bailey appeared at the 2022 D23 Expo to introduce an exclusive presentation of the film's \"Part of Your World\" sequence, which received a positive response from the attendees, who praised Bailey's vocal performance. The film's teaser trailer was released to the public the same day.[112] On October 13, 2022, the first poster was released to the public,[113] which Bailey synchronously captioned on Twitter: \"Words can't describe how immensely honored I feel to play the mermaid of my dreams.\"[114]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Entertainment Weekly*, Marshall says that this new take on Ariel spotlights a \"modern woman\". He says that the character goes back to Hans Christian Andersen from another century, but at the same time in 1989, that it felt in some ways like a very modern woman, someone who sees Ariel's life differently than anyone around her, and goes to find that dream.[115] On January 21, 2023, Disney Live Entertainment announced a casting call for character look-alike actresses to portray Bailey's version of Ariel as a character meet-and-greet at Disneyland in Anaheim, California near the \"It's a Small World\" attraction, Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida and the Walt Disney Studios park at Disneyland Paris in Paris, France, as part of the film's promotional campaign. It was later confirmed by Disney Parks that these meet-and-greets would run for a limited engagement throughout the summer, with the original, classic Ariel being reinstated afterward.[116][117][118]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2023, the official trailer was shown during the 95th Academy Awards, introduced on stage by Bailey and McCarthy, and then released online alongside a new poster.[119]\n\n\nDisney spent an estimated $140\u00a0million promoting *The Little Mermaid*.[120] The film had the biggest global promotional campaign for a Disney branded live-action title at $80\u00a0million in value, with partner deals with the likes of McDonald's, Booking.com, and Kellogg's.[121]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *The Little Mermaid* for digital download on July 25, 2023, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on September 19, 2023.[122][123] The film was released on Disney+ on September 6, 2023.[124]\n\n\nThe film debuted atop the chart of the ten most popular films on Fandango\u2019s transactional digital service Vudu during the week of July 30, 2023.[125][126] It topped the VOD charts on iTunes and Google Play the same week.[127][128] Disney announced that *The Little Mermaid* had 16 million views in the five days following its release on Disney+, becoming the most watched film on the platform during the week of its premiere since *Hocus Pocus 2* (2022); Disney defined views as total stream time divided by runtime.[129] The film topped Official Charts Company's Official Film Chart in the United Kingdom during the week of August 2, 2023,[130][131] and during the week of August 9, 2023.[132][133] According to Whip Media's TV Time, *The Little Mermaid* was the most streamed film across all platforms in the United States during the week of September 8 to September 10, 2023.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-release[edit]\n\n\n*Variety* reported that the official teaser trailer of *The Little Mermaid* garnered more than 104 million global views during the first weekend following its release. It surpassed recent Disney live-action releases including *Beauty and the Beast* with 94 million, *Aladdin* with 74 million and *Cruella* with 68 million.[136] After the release of the trailer in September 2022, videos of black girls positively reacting to it went viral.[137][138][139] In December 2022, the film ranked number three as the \"Most Anticipated Family Film\" of 2023 in a poll conducted by Fandango Media while Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy ranked number one as the \"Most Anticipated New Performance on the Big Screen\" and \"Most Anticipated Villain\", respectively.[140]\n\n\nFollowing its premiere at the 95th Academy Awards on March 12, 2023, the official trailer reportedly generated over 108 million global views within its first 24 hours.[141] It is now among the most watched trailers for any reimagined title in Disney's growing stable of live-action adaptations, and the biggest for a Disney live-action title since the 2019 remake of *The Lion King*.[142]\n\n\nAn early private test screening of the film's final cut took place on April 30, 2023, at The Whitby Hotel in New York City. The event, hosted by Marshall and DeLuca, was attended by 80 celebrities and industry professionals.[143]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*The Little Mermaid* grossed $298.2\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $271.4\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $569.6\u00a0million.[6][7] Disney received a total of \u00a346.6 million ($56.8 million) in COVID-19 insurance payouts related to the film from the UK government.[144]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *The Little Mermaid*\u2014released alongside *The Machine*, *Kandahar*, *About My Father*, and *You Hurt My Feelings*\u2014was projected to gross $120\u2013125\u00a0million from 4,320 theaters over its four-day Memorial Day opening weekend.[2] The film made $38\u00a0million on its first day, including $10.3\u00a0million from Thursday night previews.[145] It went on to debut to $95.6\u00a0million in the traditional three-day weekend, and $118.8\u00a0million over the four-day frame, topping the box office and making it the fifth highest Memorial Day opening in history[121][146][147] (20th after inflation adjustment).[148] In its second weekend, the film declined 57% to $41.4\u00a0million while finishing in second place to newcomer *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*.[149][150] The film then made $23.2\u00a0million in its third weekend, finishing third behind newcomer *Transformers: Rise of the Beasts* and *Across the Spider-Verse*.[151][152] It remained in the top ten for five more weeks.[153]\n\n\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada, the opening weekend box office results fell short of expectations, grossing just $68.3\u00a0million.[154] A financial insider described the film's opening weekend to *Deadline* as \"not a huge disappointment, but a disappointment, nonetheless.\"[120] The film's biggest markets were Mexico ($8.5\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($6.3\u00a0million), Italy ($4.7\u00a0million), Brazil and Australia (both around $4\u00a0million).[154] *The Hollywood Reporter* also reported that the film had achieved success in Japan after it had earned $10.3 million in its first two weeks of release.[155]\n\n\nThe film's biggest markets in gross value were the United Kingdom ($34.1 million), Japan ($23.9 million), Mexico ($20.9 million), Brazil (17.3 million) and Australia ($15 million).

Movie* and *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* at the box office.[155] Its performance in China and South Korea was considered disappointing; it grossed only $3.6\u00a0million in China, and $4.4\u00a0million in South Korea in first 10 days.[156][157] The film also grossed $415,672 in India and $184,214 in South Africa during its opening weekend.[6]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 346 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With Halle Bailey making a major splash in the title role, Disney's live-action *Little Mermaid* ranks among the studio's most enjoyable reimaginings.\"[158] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[159] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an overall 91% positive score, with 76% saying they would definitely recommend it.[121]\n\n\nVanessa Armstrong of */Film* called it a live-action remake \"done well\" that \"improves on the original\" and had no doubt that \"it will become an indelible part of many a young person's childhood, and I can't wait to watch it with my daughter.\"[160] Molly Edwards of *Total Film* gave it four stars out of five and called it \"A sparkling, enchanting new spin that out-swims the original, with a pitch-perfect performance from Halle Bailey.\"[161] Zo\u00eb Rose Bryant of *Next Best Picture* praised its sense of nostalgia and called Bailey and Hauer-King the \"stars of the show\". She did, however, criticize the visual effects, but said that they were \"far better than the oft-maligned trailers would lead you to believe.\"[162] Peter Debruge of *Variety* lauded the film, saying that \"Halle Bailey is all the reason that any audience should need to justify Disney revisiting this classic.\"[163] Lex Briscuso of *TheWrap* called it \"a fresh take on a beloved classic that isn't afraid to take a fairy tale and make it as real as it can, inviting its audience to dive into uncharted waters alongside its engaging and charming central characters.\"[164] Brian Lowry of *CNN* wrote that the film \"holds up nicely under the weight of those expectations, preserving the original's essence while updating undernourished aspects of it and riding a warm, hard-to-resist wave of nostalgia.\"[165] Ross Bonaime of *Collider* wrote that it \"might not match the greatness of the original, but it's the rare remake that feels worthy of being part of our world.\"[166]\n\n\nPete Hammond of *Deadline Hollywood* wrote that \"Marshall has made a movie with all the magic required to pull it off and, if not replace the original in our hearts, at least has made a movie that can stand next to that one to also become a memorable part of our cinematic world.\"[167] Maureen Lee Lenker of *Entertainment Weekly* praised the performances of Bailey, Hauer-King and McCarthy, and named the \"Under the Sea\" sequence as the film's best musical highlight.[168] Rachel LaBonte of *Screen Rant* felt mixed, saying that the film is \"bolstered by deeper characterization and a grand scope, even as it grapples with flaws.\"[169] Brian Truitt of *USA Today* wrote that \"While not everything goes swimmingly, Halle Bailey splendidly buoys this \"Mermaid\" as the naive underwater youngster with dreams of exploring the surface.\"[170] Helen O'Hara of *Empire* called it \"Another 'live-action' remake that's darker and less compelling than the animated original, but it's saved by Bailey's charming performance, McCarthy's sass and the story's own eternal magic.\"[171] Moira MacDonald of *The Seattle Times* praised Bailey's performance, saying that \"her singing voice has both sweetness and power, and her smile is the sort on which dreams dance.\"[172] Ann Hornaday of *The Washington Post* called it an \"on-the-other-fin mixed bag of a movie that honors its source material with a big, color-saturated production, while never precisely proving that it ever needed to exist.\"[173]\n\n\nOn the critical side, Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n of *Vulture* panned the film, writing that with this film, \"Disney betrays its own lack of imagination and an essential misreading of what made its original children's fare such a joy to audiences in the first place.\"[174] Lindsey Bahr of *Associated Press* wrote that \"For all its pizazz, everything about this *Little Mermaid* is just more muted. Miranda's new songs are odd, too, and don't seem to fit.\"[175] Hillary Busis of *Vanity Fair* criticized the runtime and called it an \"uneasy mix of carbon copy and superfluous added material, presented in \"live-action\" that looks and feels (and is) as artificial as Lightning McQueen.\"[176] Johnny Oleksinski of *New York Post* wrote that \"Despite real actors, CGI and brand new material, 'Mermaid' is the studio's latest flesh-and-blood cash grab that's more lifeless than far better two-dimensional painted drawings.\" Justin Chang of *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"What's on-screen too often feels like wan, second-rate imitation, and the few differences seem motivated less by a spirit of imagination than one of joyless anxiety.\"[177] \"The Scuttlebutt\" musical number was widely criticized by critics and audiences for Awkwafina's vocal performance, Lin-Manuel Miranda's lyrics (particularly the line \"Remember the swamp? Remember my song in the swamp? When I was like 'Womp, chicka womp-womp, chicka womp-woooomp'\") and its rap style not fitting in with the musical style of the other songs. Raven Brunner of *Decider* called the number \"awkward\" and that it felt \"forced\".[178] On the contrary, Wesley Morris of *The New York Times* found the song to be the standout sequence of the film.[179] A. Felicia Wade of *DiscussingFilm* wrote that \"Considering the setting, it's really out of place for the film in general.\"[180] Kat Rosenfield, writing for *UnHerd*, panned the film for being \"propaganda\" and for paling in comparison to the original, writing that \"This is perhaps the worst thing about Disney's contemporary remakes: not that they are blatant cash grabs, but that they are infantilizing. The original *Little Mermaid* placed infinitely more trust in its intended audience of children than the new version places in those same children, now that they're grown up.\"[181]\n\n\n\n### Casting of Ariel[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Color-blind casting, Racebending, and Criticism of the Walt Disney Company \u00a7\u00a0Ethnic and racial stereotyping\n\nAfter the announcement of Bailey as the role of Ariel in July 2019, and after the first teaser was released in September 2022, the film gained mixed responses from the public for casting an African-American actress as Ariel, who was originally caucasian with red hair in the 1989 animated film.[182] Arguments for the negative response have included the fact that a black mermaid does not adhere to the original story (Hans Christian Andersen's description of the mermaid is that \"her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea\"),[183][184] the claim that the adaptation should be as close to the original as possible,[185] and the idea that mermaids should be pale, not black, as they are underwater creatures.[186] Criticism of the casting after the teaser trailer release became viral and elicited the hashtag *#NotMyAriel.*[187] Many media outlets as well as Lin-Manuel Miranda, the film's producer and lyricist, criticized the negative response and described it as being racist.[188][189][190] Stuart Heritage of *The Guardian* argued, \"The boring spat over the Disney trailer makes idiots of us all \u2013 whether Ariel is Black or White, it is clearly a film that should rightfully be ignored then forgotten forever\", suggesting instead that there should be a \"grotesque scaly mutant as the lead\".[191]\n\n\nDuring an interview in August 2019, Bailey said that \"[she doesn't] pay attention to the negativity\", while Auli\u02bbi Cravalho, who played Ariel in a musical presentation as a part of *The Wonderful World of Disney*, expressed excitement at watching Bailey's portrayal of the character.[187] Jodi Benson, the voice actress for Ariel in the 1989 film, praised Bailey, stating, \"I think that the spirit of a character is what really matters\".[192] Brandy Norwood, the first woman of color to play Cinderella in the 1997 Disney television film of the same, and Anika Noni Rose, the voice of Tiana (Disney's first official African-American Princess), also both praised the casting of Bailey as Ariel.[193][194] Rachel Zegler, who played Maria in Steven Spielberg's 2021 film version of *West Side Story* and will play the titular role in Disney's 2024 live-action remake of *Snow White*, also voiced her support for Bailey.[195] In February 2023, Bailey said that she was trying to ignore the criticisms leveled by racist trolls on social media and focus on the anticipation for the film's release.[196] In a cover story for *The Face*, Bailey further added \"I know people are like: 'It's not about race.' But now that I'm her... People don't understand that when you're Black there's this whole other community... It's so important for us to see ourselves.\"[197]\n\n\nIn May 2023, an editorial from Chinese state-run tabloid *Global Times* accused Disney of \"forced inclusion of minorities\" and \"lazy and irresponsible storytelling\",[198] echoing the views of some social media users in China, Japan and South Korea.[199] The *Global Times* similarly attributed the film's poor performance in China to \"Disney turning classic tales into 'sacrificial lambs' for political correctness.\"[200]\n\n\n*Deadline Hollywood* reported that the film was suffering from review bombing online, and that sites such as IMDb in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Mexico, and AlloCin\u00e9 in France had added warnings to the rating pages for the film about \"unusual\" activity. IMDb's warning read, \"Our rating mechanism has detected unusual voting activity on this title. To preserve the reliability of our rating system, an alternate weighting calculation has been applied.\"[201] *Deadline Hollywood* cited these low user ratings as well as \"backlash... over the casting of star Halle Bailey in the title role\" in countries such as Korea, China, France, and Germany as contributing factors in the disappointing overseas box office.[120]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The Queerties | February 28, 2023\n | Next Big Thing\n | *The Little Mermaid* | Won\n | [202] |\n| Golden Trailer Awards | June 29, 2023\n | Best Original Score\n | \"Above\" (Level Up AV)\n | Nominated\n | [203][204] |\n| Bulletin Awards\n | August 18, 2023\n | Film of the Year\n | *The Little Mermaid* | Won\n | [205] |\n| Best Actor in a Motion Picture\n | Halle Bailey\n | Won\n |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | November 15, 2023 | Original Song \u2014 Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film | Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda (\"For The First Time\")\n | Nominated\n | [206][207] |\n| Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda (\"Wild Uncharted Waters\")\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Song \u2013 Onscreen Performance (Film)\n | Halle Bailey (\"For The First Time\")\n | Nominated\n |\n| Music Themed Film, Biopic, or Musical\n | *The Little Mermaid* | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n\n### Printed adaptations[edit]\n\n\nA series of books based on the film were released on April 11, 2023, by Disney Press.[208][209] It includes an illustrated picture book titled *The Little Mermaid: Make a Splash* by Ashley Franklin and Paul Kellam.[210][211] The guidebook *The Little Mermaid: Guide to Merfolk* detailing the depictions of Ariel, her sisters, and universe from the film by Eric Geron.[212] The novelization of the film titled *The Little Mermaid: The Novelization* by Faith Noelle.[213] *The Little Mermaid: This is Ariel* by Colin Hosten.[214][215] And the young adult novel *The Little Mermaid: Against the Tide* by American author J. Elle.[216][217][218] The novel serves as a prequel.[219][220][221] It featured on *The New York Times* Best Seller list,[222] where it spent several weeks in the top ten and reached the fifth spot in the category \"Young Adult Hardcover Books.\"[223][224]\n\n\n\n### Spin-off[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2023, a CGI-animated series entitled *Ariel* inspired by the film was announced for Disney Junior. The series is set to be released in 2024.[225]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2022, after the positive repercussions of black children watching the trailer, rumors emerged that Disney had contacted Halle Bailey to negotiate a possible sequel.[226] In April 2023, Marshall hinted at the potential for sequels if the film is successful, saying, \"It's a classic story that has a lot of characters and a lot of interesting stories. I do think it's right for certain things. But you have to see how a movie plays, and how it does... I think there's always opportunity to find stories within stories. That's always a wonderful thing.\"[227] In May 2023, Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King spoke about the animated sequel *The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea*, saying that they liked it and they would agree to reprise their roles if it were adapted into live action.[228]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*The Little Mermaid* (PG)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Initially known for working on mumblecore films,[2][3] she has since expanded from acting in and co-writing independent films to directing major studio films. Gerwig was included in the annual *Time* 100 list of the most influential people in the world in 2018.[4]\n\n\nGerwig began her career working with Joe Swanberg on films such as *Hannah Takes the Stairs* (2007) and *Nights and Weekends* (2008).[5] She has collaborated with her partner Noah Baumbach on several films, including *Greenberg* (2010) and *Frances Ha* (2012), for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination, *Mistress America* (2015), and *White Noise* (2022). She also acted in such films as Whit Stillman's *Damsels in Distress* (2011), Woody Allen's *To Rome with Love* (2012), Rebecca Miller's *Maggie's Plan* (2015), Pablo Larra\u00edn's *Jackie* (2016), Mike Mills' *20th Century Women* (2016), and Wes Anderson's *Isle of Dogs* (2018).[6][7]\n\n\nAs a solo filmmaker, Gerwig has written and directed the coming-of-age films *Lady Bird* (2017) and *Little Women* (2019), both of which earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture. For the former, she received Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay,[8] and for the latter, she was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Her next directorial, the fantasy comedy *Barbie* (2023), which she co-wrote with Baumbach, became the first film from a solo female director to gross over $1 billion worldwide.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGerwig was born in Sacramento, California, and grew up in the River Park neighborhood.[10] She is the daughter of Christine, an OB-GYN nurse, and Gordon Gerwig, who worked for a credit union on small business loans.[10][11] She is close to her parents and they make an appearance in *Frances Ha* as her character's parents.[11] She has an older brother, a landscape architect, and a sister, a manager at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[12][13][14] Gerwig has German ancestry.[13]\n\n\nGerwig was raised a Unitarian Universalist.[15] She attended St. Francis High School, an all-girls Catholic school in Sacramento, and graduated in 2002.[11][16] She has described herself as having been \"an intense child.\"[17][18] Gerwig showed an early interest in dance and later took up competitive fencing but had to quit, in part due to the high costs.[18][19] She had intended to complete a degree in musical theater in New York; however, she ended up graduating from Barnard College with a degree in English and philosophy.[18][20] Outside of class, she performed in the Columbia University Varsity Show with her dorm-mate Kate McKinnon, who stars in Gerwig's *Barbie* (2023).[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2006\u20132009: Early work[edit]\n\n\nGerwig originally intended to become a playwright, but she turned to acting when she was not admitted to playwriting MFA programs.[11] In 2006, while still studying at Barnard, she was cast in a minor role in Joe Swanberg's *LOL*, and appeared in *Baghead* by Jay and Mark Duplass. She began a partnership with Swanberg, which resulted in the duo's co-writing *Hannah Takes the Stairs* (2007), and sharing both writing and directing duties on *Nights and Weekends* (2008). Through these films, she became known as a key figure in the rising mumblecore film movement[2][3] and was often referred to as an \"it girl\".[5][23][24] Although she had an association with a number of other mumblecore filmmakers and appeared in several films, mainstream success remained elusive.\n\n\nOf this period in her life, Gerwig has said, \"I was really depressed. I was 25 [in 2008] and thinking, 'This is supposed to be the best time and I'm miserable' but it felt like acting was happening for me, and I went back to acting classes.\"[18]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132016: Independent films[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gerwig at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival\nIn 2010, Gerwig starred in Noah Baumbach's *Greenberg* with Ben Stiller, Rhys Ifans, and Jennifer Jason Leigh.[25][26] In an appraisal of her work in this and other films, *The New York Times* critic A. O. Scott described Gerwig as an \"ambassador of a cinematic style that often seems opposed to the very idea of style.\" \"She seems to be embarked on a project,\" Scott wrote, \"however piecemeal and modestly scaled, of redefining just what it is we talk about when we talk about acting.\"[27] In 2010, Gerwig made her first talk show appearance on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* From 2011 to 2015, she voiced Pony, one of the main characters in the Adult Swim animated series *China, IL*. In 2011, she was cast as a lead in an HBO pilot adaptation of *The Corrections*, which however was not picked up to series.[18] Also that year she starred in Whit Stillman's comedy *Damsels in Distress* (2011) which premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. Critic Roger Ebert compared the film favorably to the novels of P.G. Wodehouse and praised Gerwig's performance, writing \"He's also lucky to have found an actress in Gerwig who finds the perfect note for playing a woman who knows everything better than you do, but doesn't believe she's being stuck up about it; she's just being kind.\"[28] In 2012, Gerwig appeared in Woody Allen's film *To Rome with Love* in the vignette *John's Story*, acting alongside Jesse Eisenberg and Alec Baldwin.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gerwig at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival\nGerwig and Baumbach co-wrote Baumbach's next film, *Frances Ha*, which was released in May 2013 after having toured the festival circuit since September 2012. Gerwig played the title role, and received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.[30]\nRichard Brody of *The New Yorker* wrote \"Gerwig may be famed for acting like a nonactor, but she's an extraordinarily accomplished actor (as she proved in *Damsels in Distress*), and here she puts the movie on her back and carries it from beginning to end, combining the spontaneous inspiration and personal presence of her earlier films\".[31] Her third collaboration with Baumbach, *Mistress America,* was released in August 2015 to generally positive reviews.[32][33]\n\n\nIn May 2014, Gerwig made her stage debut as Becky in Penelope Skinner's *The Village Bike* at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York. The production earned mixed reviews but her performance was praised by many including Ben Brantley of *The New York Times* who wrote, \"Ms. Gerwig uses the off-balance, open-faced presence she brought to films like *Frances Ha* and *Greenberg* to hook us from the moment we set eyes on her.\" He added, \"Gerwig turns out to be the perfect person to ride right over the edge of a cliff with\".[34] The show ran until the end of June.[35] She was nominated for the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Actress for her performance.[36] She was cast in the lead role in a spin-off of *How I Met Your Mother* titled *How I Met Your Dad* in 2014,[37] but it was not picked up to series.[38]\n\n\nGerwig's next starring role was in Rebecca Miller's *Maggie's Plan*, which premiered as an official selection of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival,[39] opening to positive reviews.[40][41][42] The film was also screened at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. Peter Bradshaw compared Gerwig's performance to that of Annie Hall and described the movie as being, \"a witty [and] sharp comedy\".[43] That same year, Gerwig played supporting roles as White House Social Secretary Nancy Tuckerman in Pablo Larra\u00edn's drama film *Jackie*,[44] and Abigail Porter in Mike Mills' coming-of-age comedy *20th Century Women*,[45] earning acclaim for both performances, particularly her work in the latter, for which she earned a nomination for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress.[6] Also in 2016, she guest-starred in two episodes of the comedy series *The Mindy Project*.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2017\u2013present: Directorial focus[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Gerwig made her solo directorial debut (after having co-directed *Nights and Weekends*) with the coming-of-age comedy-drama film *Lady Bird*, which she also wrote.[47] The film's cast includes Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Beanie Feldstein, Stephen McKinley Henderson, and Lois Smith.[48] *Lady Bird* premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and was theatrically released in November 2017. The film grossed over $78 million against its $10 million budget worldwide.\n\n\nUpon its release, *Lady Bird* received widespread critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly lauding Gerwig's screenplay and direction.[49][50] The film was chosen by the National Board of Review, the American Film Institute, and *Time* magazine as one of the top ten films of 2017.[51][52][53] According to the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it was given 196 positive reviews in a row, making it the record-holder for the most \"fresh\" reviews,[54] until the first \"rotten\" one arrived in December 2017.[55] It currently has a 99% rating on the aforementioned website.[56]\n\n\nAt the 75th Golden Globe Awards, *Lady Bird* won Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy and Best Actress \u2013 Musical or Comedy for Saoirse Ronan, and also received nominations for Best Supporting Actress for Laurie Metcalf and Best Screenplay for Gerwig. At the 90th Academy Awards, it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Gerwig, Best Actress for Ronan, and Best Supporting Actress for Metcalf. With the nominations announced, Gerwig became the fifth woman in Oscar history to be nominated for Best Director.[8] When she found out about the nominations, Gerwig said she was \"in various states of laughing and crying and yelling with joy.\"[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gerwig at the 2018 Berlin International Film Festival\nIn 2018, following the success of *Lady Bird*, Gerwig was part of the voice cast of Wes Anderson's stop-motion animated film *Isle of Dogs*, which premiered at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival to critical acclaim, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[58]\n\n\nIn June 2018, it was announced that Gerwig would direct a new film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel *Little Women*, whose script she had been previously hired to write. With an ensemble cast featuring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Laura Dern, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Meryl Streep,[59][60][61] *Little Women* was released in December 2019 to widespread critical acclaim.[62] At the 92nd Academy Awards, it received six nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actress for Ronan, Best Supporting Actress for Pugh, Best Adapted Screenplay for Gerwig,[63] Best Original Score, and a win for Best Costume Design. The film was frequently mentioned as part of an Oscars controversy after no woman (including Gerwig) was nominated for Best Director, a snub that was publicly noted by Hillary Clinton and *Saturday Night Live*, amongst others.[64] Gerwig's name was one of those featured on the outfit that actress Natalie Portman wore to the ceremony, which featured the surnames of snubbed female directors from that year's ceremony.[65]\n\n\nGerwig co-starred with Adam Driver in Baumbach's 2022 film *White Noise*, adapted from the novel of the same name by Don DeLillo for Netflix. The movie opened both the 79th Venice International Film Festival and the 60th New York Film Festival and was made available on the streaming platform in late 2022.[66] Gerwig also directed and co-wrote with Baumbach the fantasy comedy *Barbie* for Warner Bros. Pictures, based on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel. It finished filming in 2022 and opened theatrically on July 21, 2023. The movie features Margot Robbie in the title role alongside Ryan Gosling (as the doll Ken), Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey and Michael Cera.[67][68][69] On August 6, 2023, the film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide, making Gerwig the first woman with sole director credit to have a movie make more than $1 billion.[70]\n\n\nIn November 2021, it was reported that Gerwig had done work on the screenplay for Disney's upcoming live-action film *Snow White*.[71] *The New Yorker* reported in July 2023 that she had been hired by Netflix to write and direct two film adaptations of C. S. Lewis' *The Chronicles of Narnia* book series. Gerwig's talent agent, Jeremy Barber, said that she was \"looking to move beyond the small-scale dramas she was known for,\" and that her ambition was to be a \"big studio director.\"[72]\n\n\n\n## Directorial style[edit]\n\n\nGerwig's films tend to be based on her own experiences. In a behind-the-scenes video on the set of *Lady Bird* she said, \"I tend to start with things from my own life, then pretty quickly they spin out into their own orbit.\"[73] Gerwig presses her actors to incorporate their personalities into their performances as well, and says of her writing and directing, \"it's all about actors.\"[73] By contrast, she allows little line improvisation and the script is followed fairly closely.[11]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Maclean's*, Gerwig cited Woody Allen as a major influence in her work stating, \"His influence is hard to measure because it runs so deep\".[74][75] Her other influences include Howard Hawks, Ernst Lubitsch, Carole Lombard, Joan Didion, Patti Smith, Chantal Akerman, Claire Denis, Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve, John Huston, Mike Leigh and Agn\u00e8s Varda.[76][77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nShe lives in Manhattan with American filmmaker Noah Baumbach, her partner since late 2011.[80][81] They have two sons together, born in March 2019 and February 2023.[82][83]\n\n\nShe has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[84]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | *LOL* | Greta\n |  |\n| 2007\n | *Hannah Takes the Stairs* | Hannah\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Baghead* | Michelle\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Yeast* | Gen\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Nights and Weekends* | Mattie\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Quick Feet, Soft Hands* | Lisa\n | Short film |\n| 2008\n | *I Thought You Finally Completely Lost It* | Greta\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *You Wont Miss Me* | Bridget\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *The House of the Devil* | Megan\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Greenberg* | Florence Marr\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Art House* | Nora Ohr\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Northern Comfort* | Cassandra\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *The Dish & the Spoon* | Rose\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *No Strings Attached* | Patrice\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Damsels in Distress* | Violet Wister\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Arthur* | Naomi Quinn\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Lola Versus* | Lola\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *To Rome with Love* | Sally\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Frances Ha* | Frances Halladay\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *Eden* | Julia\n |  |\n| 2014\n | *The Humbling* | Pegeen Mike Stapleford\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Mistress America* | Brooke Cardinas\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Maggie's Plan* | Maggie Hardin\n |  |\n| 2016\n | *Wiener-Dog* | Dawn Wiener\n |  |\n| 2016\n | *Jackie* | Nancy Tuckerman |  |\n| 2016\n | *20th Century Women* | Abigail Porter\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Meyerowitz Stories* | Victoria (voice)\n | Uncredited\n |\n| 2018\n | *Isle of Dogs* | Tracy Walker (voice)\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *White Noise* | Babette Gladney\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009\n | *A NY Thing* | Tamera\n | Television film\n |\n| 2011\u20132015\n | *China, IL* | Pony Merks\n | Main cast, voice\n |\n| 2012\n | *The Corrections* | Julia Vrais\n | Unsold, unfinished pilot |\n| 2014\n | *How I Met Your Dad* | Sally\n | Lead character, unsold pilot |\n| 2015\n | *Portlandia* | Mermaid\n | Episode: \"Doug Becomes a Feminist\"\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Mindy Project* | Sarah Branum\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Saturday Night Live* | Ms. Reynolds\n | Uncredited;

Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7\u00a0billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3\u00a0billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules\u2014especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year\u2014and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000\u2013100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000\u2013800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000\u201322,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2021 | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111 ($1,912,233,593)\n | $200,000,000\n | [# 13][# 306] |\n| 2022 | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | $350,000,000\u2013460,000,000 | [# 5][# 307][# 308] |\n| 2023 | *Barbie* \u2020\n | $1,441,740,954\n | $128,000,000\u2013145,000,000 | [# 26][# 27] |\n\n\n(...)

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Schickel, Richard (1996). *D.

The four *Avengers* films, the two *Frozen* films, and the two *Avatar* films are the only franchises where each installment has grossed over $1\u00a0billion, although the *Jurassic Park* and *Black Panther* series have averaged over $1\u00a0billion per film.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Seymour, Lee (December 18, 2017). \"Over The Last 20 Years, Broadway's 'Lion King' Has Made More Money For Disney Than 'Star Wars'\". *Forbes*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Spartacus*: \"In the case of *Spartacus*, overseas earnings to 1969 amounted to $12,462,044, while U.S. and Canadian rentals (even including a million-dollar TV sale) were only $10,643,181.

The film returned to movie theaters for the third time in the spring of 1942 and stayed in release until late 1943 ...

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32\u00a0million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box-office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.[46]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915\u20131919 at slightly more than $5.2\u00a0million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2\u00a0million.\n86. **^** Lang, Robert, ed.

During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with *The Birth of a Nation* (American Civil War), *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse*, *The Big Parade* and *Wings* (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with *All Quiet on the Western Front* in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical\u2014the genre best placed to showcase the new technology\u2014took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The 1972 pornographic film *Deep Throat* reportedly earned as much as $600\u00a0million, a figure that may have been inflated by gangsters in money-laundering schemes.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski, and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> Box-office figures are reported in either gross revenue or *distributor rentals*, the latter being especially true of older films. Commonly mistaken for home video revenue, distributor rentals are the distributor's share of the film's theatrical revenue (i.e. the box office gross less the exhibitor's cut).[41][42] Historically, the rental price averaged at 30\u201340% when the distributors owned the theater chains, equating to just over a third of the gross being paid to the distributor of the film.[43] In the modern marketplace, rental fees can vary greatly\u2014depending on a number of factors\u2014although the films from the major studios average out at 43%.[41]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *From Russia With Love*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 78.9; Production Cost: 2.0 (in millions of $s)\"\n\t* *Goldfinger*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 124.9; Production Cost: 3.0 (in millions of $s)\"\n\t* *Diamonds Are Forever*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 116; Production Cost: 7.2 (in millions of $s)\"\n\t* *Moonraker*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 210.3; Production Cost: 34.0 (in millions of $s)\"\n215. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Chapman, James (2007). *Licence to thrill: a cultural history of the James Bond films*.
