Korean Confucianism is especially found in Brazil while Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Confucianism is spread throughout the continent.\n\n\nKardecist Spiritism can be found in several countries.\n\n\n**Religions in South America as of 2013:[11]**\n\n\n\n\n\nReligion in South America\n| Country\n | Christians\n | *Catholics* | *Other Christians* | No religion (atheists and agnostics)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **![](image) Argentina** | 88% | 77% | 11% | 11%\n |\n| **![](image) Bolivia** | 96% | 74% | 22% | 4%\n |\n| **![](image) Brazil** | 86% | 64% | 22% | 9%\n |\n| **![](image) Chile** | 70% | 57% | 13% | 25%\n |\n| **![](image) Colombia**  | 92% | 80% | 12% | 7%\n |\n| **![](image) Paraguay** | 95% | 85% | 10% | 2%\n |\n| **![](image) Peru** | 94% | 81% | 13% | 3%\n |\n| **![](image) Suriname** | 51% | 29% | 22% | 5%\n |\n| **![](image) Uruguay** | 58% | 47% | 11% | 41%\n |\n| **![](image) Venezuela** | 88% | 71% | 17% | 8%\n |\n\n\n## Racial[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of race, the demographics of South America shows a mixture of Africans, Amerindians, Europeans, Anusim or Marranos, and to a lesser extent Arabs, Romanis, and East Asians. A mixture of Amerindian and European ancestry is often referred to as mestizo or caboclo/mameluco. Castizos are people whose DNA is mostly European with Indigenous markers assimilation. A mixture of Amerindian and African ancestry is referred to in many South American countries as zambo or cafuzo. A mixture of European and African ancestry is referred to as mulatto. A mix of European and Japanese is referred as ainoko or hafu. Chile administers Easter Island in the South Pacific, which is home to 2,500 Polynesians, the Rapa Nui people.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Ethnic distribution in South America[12][13]**\n| Country\n | Amerindians | White people | Mestizos | Mulattos | Black people | Zambos | East Asians | Other | East Indians |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Argentina | 1.0% | **85.0**% | 14.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia | **53.0**% | 14.0% | 30.0% | 2.4% | 0.0% | 0.5% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Brazil | 0.4% | **47.7**% | 22.9% | 20.1% | 7.6% | 0.0% | 1.1% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | 3.0% |  **52.0** % | 48.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Colombia | 1.8% | 37.0% | **49.0**% | 8.2% | 2.3% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Ecuador | 25.0% | 9.9% | **56.1**% | 3.9% | 5.0% | 0.0% | 0.1% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Guyana | 10.5% | 1.5% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 29.3% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 19.9% | **39.8%** |\n| ![](image) Paraguay | 3.0% | 43.0% | **55.0**% | 0.5% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Peru | 37.0% | 20.0% | **38.0**% | 2.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 3.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Suriname | 3.8% | 1.0% | 0.0% | 15.7% | 21.7% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 13.4% | **42.6%** |\n| ![](image) Uruguay | 0.0% | **88.0**% | 8.0% | 4.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | 2.7% | 42.7% | **49.7**% | 7.7% | 2.0% | 0.0% | 0.8% | 0.0% | 0.0%\n |\n\n\nSouth America is home to 400 million people, of which 180 million is composed of Whites with several different European extractions, as well as people with other lineages including 17 million Levantine Arabs, mostly Christians from the Levant region, (found in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Chile), 440 thousand Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (mostly Argentina and Brazil, with both figuring among the top 10 largest Jewish diasporas) and 1.3 million Crypto-Jews or Anusim.\n\n\nAccording to genetic tests, the most prevalent DNA marker found in all people of the continent (including Whites and mixed peoples) is a marker for Iberian genes (Portuguese and Spaniard).[*citation needed*] After Iberian (i.e.Lusitanian, Galician, Castilian and Catalan), the main European ethnicities are Italian, German and Slavic, followed by French and Dutch.\n\n\nBrazil has 31 million Italians and Argentina 20, Uruguay, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador also have considerable Italian diasporas. Brazil has 15.7 million Germans, Austrians, Luxembourgers and Swiss (second largest German diaspora after US) and Argentina 3.5 million consisting mostly of Russian Volga Germans. Other German groups can be found in Chile, Bolivia (mostly Mennonites), Paraguay (mostly German-Brazilians but including Mennonites), Peru, Uruguay and colonies in Venezuela.\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Slavic population with the number of Poles[14] reaching 3 million people, followed by Ukrainians and Russians but comprising many other nationalities. Argentina following with the second largest number of Slavs, comprises a sizeable Croatian population, although Chile's Croatian community is the largest outside Croatia.\n\n\nBrazil has the largest Dutch and Scandinavian (mostly Norwegian) populations as well as the largest Lithuanian diaspora outside Baltic states. A small number of Boers or White Afrikaners migrated to South America during the 20th century, heading especially to Argentina and Brazil. And Lithuanian refugees fleeing the Nazi invasion and Soviet annexation in WW2 also formed communities in Colombia and Venezuela.\nBrazil also comprises the largest Hungarian, Estonian and Finnish diasporas, being followed by Argentina in terms of nationalities of Uralic languages. Argentina has the largest French and Irish populations, respectively 6 million and 1 million, while Argentine Patagonia is home to Welsh and Swedish colonies. Brazil and Chile are also home to considerable French ancestry populations. A great part of the French immigrants in Chile were of Basque descent, with the number of Basques estimated at 4 million. Chile has 800 thousand British and Irish people. Brazil and Argentina also have sizable British Latin American populations, being the responsible for the introduction of football in the 19th century.\n\n\nThe number of Gypsies or Romani people revolves around 1.120 million, with a possibility of being much higher, being spread all over the continent. Most of the Romanis in Brazil are of Eastern European and Baltic background, while most of the Gypsies in Argentina, Chile and Colombia came from Spain.\n\n\nSouth America is also home to 124 million Castizo, Mestizo or Caboclo people (citizens whose DNA is mostly European spanning from 65 to 90% European genes with considerable Indigenous admixture) and 27 million people with pure Indigenous extraction, mostly found in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, South of Colombia and parts of Chile and Northwest Argentina. Mestizos make the majority in Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador.\n\n\nBlack phenotype and Mulatto population are respectively 18 and 48 million, when combined 66 million. Mulattos have a range of 60 to 80% European genes and are mostly found in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana where French ancestry Mulattos are the majority. To a much smaller percentage degree they can be found in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. The Guianas region where today are the independent states of Guyana and Suriname as well as France overseas department of French Guiana is home to the Maroons (formerly called \"Bush Negroes\") who are of African descent, with some Amerindian admixture. The Maroons, descendants of escaped African slaves, live primarily along the Maroni River.\n\n\nMost East Indian Hindus and Muslims live in Guyana and Suriname which is also home to a large Muslim Javanese community. East Indians are the vast majority in Guyana, followed by Blacks and also the majority in Suriname where they are followed by Maroons and Creoles.\n\n\nIndonesians from the island of Java make 13.7% of Suriname's population which figures as 275 thousand Javanese people. Dutch Surinamese or Boeroes make the minority of the country due to the fact that most of the Dutch emigrated to Brazil or returned to the Netherlands after Suriname's independence.\n\n\nSouth America is home to over 5 million Asians, mostly East Asians, with Brazil and Peru having the largest Asian Latin American populations. Peru and Venezuela have greatly numerous 19th century Chinese coolie populations with almost 1.9 million Chinese people combined. Peru itself is home to over 1.4 million Chinese Peruvians, mostly arriving as indentured servants. The Asian-Brazilian population is mostly composed of Japanese descendants and Japanese nationals, but it also comprises over 250 thousand Chinese and 50 thousand Taiwanese recent immigrants. Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador also follow in numbers of Chinese immigrants.\n\n\nBrazil is home to the largest Japanese and Korean populations in the continent with respectively 1.8 million and 140 thousand people. The Nipponic or Nipponese population in Brazil is the largest Japanese diaspora outside Japan. Koreans can also be found in Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay and Chile. Peru is home to 160 thousand Japanese descendants, and Nipponese populations are also found in Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and Venezuela. Argentina is home to the largest Filipino population with 15 thousand people.\n\n\nOther Asian nationalities can be found in smaller numbers, such as South Asians or East Indians, Southeast Asians and Central Asians. Brazil has 5 thousand Vietnamese people, 10 thousand East Indians, as well as 5 thousand Afghans, and a small number of Iranians. Argentina also have small numbers of Southern Asians or East Indians, while being home to most Southeast Asians, mostly Filipino.\n\n\nBrazil is home to the largest White Latin American population in absolute numbers constituting 98 million people. Uruguay has the largest percentage with 90.7% being Caucasian or over 3 million people. Argentina equally corresponds to the second largest population and percentage with 39 million people, followed by Colombia with 18m, Venezuela 13.1m, Chile 9.5m, Peru 5.8m, Bolivia 2m, Paraguay 1.3m and Ecuador with 980 thousand.\n\n\nRoughly 14% of the population in French Guiana is of European ancestry, numbering at 35 thousand people. The vast majority of these are of French heritage, though there are also people of Dutch, British, Spanish and Portuguese ancestry. Countries that make part of South America but do not have Romance languages as their official national languages are Guyana, Suriname and the Falkland Islands.\n\n\nSuriname has 2% of Europeans and Levantines or 12 thousand people, including Lebanese and Jews. Most Boeroes or Dutch Surinamese left after independence in 1975. There are less than 3 thousand Whites in Guyana where 0.5% of the population is counted as \"others\". The Falkland Islands have a low population density.\n\n\nAccording to the 2012 census, the average daily population of the Falklands was 2,932, excluding military personnel serving in the archipelago and their dependents. \nThe Falklands are a homogeneous society, with the majority of inhabitants descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833. Other groups are English, French, Gibraltarian, Scandinavian, Saint Helenian and Argentine.\n\n\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples of South America\n\n![](image)Main indigenous language families of South America (except Quechua, Aymaran, and Mapuche).\n![](image)Main native languages in Latin America, legend: \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   Quechua  |   Guarani  |   Aymara  |\n|   Nahuatl  |   Mayan languages  |   Mapuche  |\n\n\nIndigenous people make up about half of the population of Peru and Bolivia. In many places indigenous people still practice a traditional lifestyle based on subsistence agriculture or as hunter-gatherers. There are still some uncontacted tribes residing in the Amazon Rainforest.\n\n\n\n#### Argentina[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Argentina\n\nArgentina's indigenous population in 2010 was about 900,329 (2.38% of total population); this figure includes 457,363 people who self-identified as belonging to an indigenous ethnic group, and the remaining 142,966 who recognized themselves as first-generation descendants of an Amerindian people.[15] The ten most populous indigenous peoples are the Mapuche (113,680 people), the Kolla (70,505), the Toba (69,452) and the Guaraní (68,454).\n\n\n\n#### Bolivia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Bolivia\n\nIn Bolivia, a 62% majority of residents over the age of 15 self-identify as belonging to an indigenous people, while another 3.7% grew up with an indigenous mother tongue yet do not self-identify as indigenous.[16] Including both of these categories, and children under 15, some 66.4% of Bolivia's population was registered as indigenous in the 2001 Census.[17] The largest indigenous ethnic groups are: Quechua (about 2,500,000 people), Aymara (2,000,000), Chiquitano (181.000), Guaraní (126.000) and Mojeño (69,000).\n\n\n\n#### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 700,000 people.[18][19] Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in indigenous territories in the North and Centre-Western part of the country. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Chile[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples in Chile\n\nAccording to the 2002 Census, 4.6% of the Chilean population (including the Rapanui of Easter Island) 692,000 persons was self-identified of indigenous origins.[21] Many are descendants of the Mapuche, and live in Santiago, Araucanía and the lake district. Other groups include the Aimara who live mainly in Arica-Parinacota and Tarapacá Region and has the mayority of their alikes living in Bolivia and Peru and the Alacalufe survivors who now reside mainly in Puerto Edén.\n\n\n\n#### Colombia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Colombia\n\nColombia's indigenous peoples nonetheless encompass at least 85 distinct cultures and more than 1,378,884 people.[22][23] A variety of collective rights for indigenous peoples are recognized in the 1991 Constitution. One of these is the Muisca culture, a subset of the larger Chibcha ethnic group, famous for their use of gold, which led to the legend of *El Dorado*.\n\n\n\n#### Ecuador[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Ecuador\n\nAt the present the 25% of Ecuador's population is of indigenous heritage. Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendants of Incans, they are Kichwa speakers and include the Caranqui, the Otavaleños, the Cayambi, the Quitu-Caras, the Panzaleo, the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruhá, the Cañari, and the Saraguro.\n\n\n\n#### Peru[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Indigenous Peoples in Peru\n\nIndigenous population in Peru make up around 34%. Native Peruvian traditions and customs have shaped the way Peruvians live and see themselves today. Cultural citizenship—or what Renato Rosaldo has called, \"the right to be different and to belong, in a democratic, participatory sense\" (1996:243)—is not yet very well developed in Peru. This is perhaps no more apparent than in the country's Amazonian regions where indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored economic abuses, cultural discrimination, and pervasive violence.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Venezuela[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Venezuela\n\nIndigenous population in Venezuela form about 2% of the total population,[25] although many Venezuelans share some indigenous ancestry. Indigenous people are concentrated in the Southern Amazon rainforest state of Amazonas, where they make up nearly 50% of the population and in the Andes of the western state of Zulia. The most numerous indigenous people, at about 200,000, is the Venezuelan part of the Wayuu (or Guajiro) people who primarily live in Zulia between Lake Maracaibo and the Colombian border. Another 100,000 or so indigenous people live in the sparsely populated southeastern states of Amazonas, Bolívar, and Delta Amacuro.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of Central America\n* Demographics of Latin America\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Land areas and population estimates are taken from *The 2008 World Factbook* which currently uses August 2007 data, unless otherwise noted.\n2. **^** \"The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency\". *www.cia.gov*.

The total fertility rate (births per woman) for Africa is 4.7 as of 2018, the highest in the world according to the World Bank.[4] The most populous African country is Nigeria with over 206 million inhabitants as of 2020 and a growth rate of 2.6% p.a.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Africa\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Alternative Estimates of African Population, 0–2018 AD (in thousands)[edit]\n\n\nSource: Maddison and others.

[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs of 2019, the total population of Africa is estimated at 1.3 billion, representing 16 percent of the world's population.[12] According to UN estimates, the population of Africa may reach 2.49 billion by 2050 (about 26% of the world's total) and 4.28 billion by 2100 (about 39% of the world's total).[12] The number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050.[13]\n\n\nThe population of Africa first surpassed one billion in 2009, with a doubling time of 27 years (growth rate 2.6% p.a.).[14]\n\n\nPopulation growth has continued at almost the same pace, and total population is expected to surpass 2 billion by 2038 (doubling time 29 years, 2.4% p.a.).[5]\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa are expected to make more than half of the global population increase projected through 2050.[15]\n\n\nThe reason for the uncontrolled population growth since the mid 20th century is the decrease of infant mortality and general increase of life expectancy without a corresponding reduction in fertility rate, due to a very limited use of contraceptives. Further factors generally associated with decreased fertility include wealth, education, and female labor participation.[16] Uncontrolled population growth threatens to overwhelm infrastructure development and to cripple economic development.[17] Kenya and Zambia are pursuing programs to promote family planning in an attempt to curb growth rates.[18]\n\n\nThe extreme population growth in Africa is driven by East Africa, Middle Africa and West Africa, which regions are projected to more than quintuple their populations over the 21st century. The most extreme of these is Middle Africa, with an estimated population increase by 681%, from less than 100 million in 2000 to more than 750 million in 2100 (almost half of this figure is driven by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, projected to increase from 47 million in 2000 to 362 million in 2100). Projected population growth is less extreme in Southern Africa and North Africa, which are expected, respectively, to not quite double and triple their populations over the same period.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 84.00–85.99\n 82.00–83.99\n 80.00–81.99\n 78.00–79.99\n 76.00–77.99\n 74.00–75.99\n | 72.00–73.99\n 70.00–71.99\n 68.00–69.99\n 66.00–67.99\n 64.00–65.99\n 62.00–63.99\n | 60.00–61.99\n 58.00–59.99\n 56.00–57.99\n 54.00–55.99\n 52.00–53.99\n no data\n |\n\n Life expectancy by region in 2021[19]\nPopulation estimates by region (in billions):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 2000 | 2050 | 2100\n |\n| East Africa | 0.26 | 0.85 (+227%, +1.8% p.a.) | 1.45 (+458%, +0.6% p.a.) |\n| Central Africa | 0.096 | 0.38 (+296%, +2.1% p.a.)  | 0.75 (+681%, +0.8% p.a.)  |\n| North Africa | 0.17 | 0.37 (+118%, +1.1% p.a.)  | 0.50 (+194%, +0.3% p.a.)  |\n| Southern Africa | 0.051 | 0.087 (+70%, +0.6% p.a.)  | 0.094 (+82%, -0.1% p.a.)  |\n| West Africa | 0.23 | 0.80 (+248%, +2.0% p.a.)  | 1.48 (+543%, +0.7% p.a.)  |\n| **Africa** | 0.81 | 2.49 (+207%, +1.7% p.a.)  | 4.28 (+428%, +0.6% p.a.)  |\n| **World** | 6.14 | 9.73 (+58%, +0.5% p.a.)  | 10.88 (+77%, +0.0% p.a.)  |\n\n\n## Births[edit]\n\n\nAll countries in Africa had TFRs above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27.1% of global livebirths.[20]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)World map indicating infant mortality rates per 1000 births in 2006.[21]\nFurther information: List of African countries by life expectancy and HIV/AIDS in Africa\n\n### History of health care development in sub-Saharan Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1987, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee announced the launching of the Bamako Initiative— chartered in response to financial issues occurring in the region during the 1980s, and with the aim of increasing access to vital medications through community involvement in revolving drug funds.[22][23] The 1987 Bamako Initiative conference, organized by the WHO was held in Bamako, the capital of Mali, and helped reshape the health policy of sub-Saharan Africa.[24] The meeting was attended by African Ministers of Health who advocated for improvement of healthcare access through the revitalization of primary healthcare.[22][23] The new strategy substantially increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. The public health community within the region raised issues in response to the initiative, of which included: equity, access, affordability, integration issues, relative importance given to medications, management, dependency, logistics, and sustainability.[22] As a result of these critiques, the Initiative later transformed to address the increase of accessibility of health services, the enhancement of quality of health services, and the overall improvement of health system management.[22] A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.[25][26]\n\n\n\n### Major health challenges[edit]\n\n\nThe Eastern African, Central African, Western African and Southern African regions experience disproportionate rates of infectious and chronic diseases in comparison to other global regions.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Diabetes[edit]\n\n\nType 2 diabetes persists as an epidemic in the region posing a public health and socioeconomic crisis for Sub-Saharan Africa. Scarcity of data for pathogenesis and subtypes for diabetes in Sub-Saharan African communities has led to gaps in documenting epidemiology for the disease. High rates of undiagnosed diabetes in many countries leaves individuals at a high risk of chronic health complications, thus, posing a high risk of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality in the region.[28]\n\n\n\n#### HIV/AIDS[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Africa was home to 69% of all people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide.[29] In response, a number of initiatives have been launched to educate the public on HIV/AIDS. Among these are combination prevention programmes, considered to be the most effective initiative, the abstinence, be faithful, use a condom campaign, and the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation's outreach programs.[30] According to a 2013 special report issued by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the number of HIV positive people in Africa receiving anti-retroviral treatment in 2012 was over seven times the number receiving treatment in 2005, with an almost 1 million added in the last year alone.[31][32] The number of AIDS-related deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 33 percent less than the number in 2005.[33] The number of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 25 percent less than the number in 2001.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Malaria[edit]\n\n\nMalaria is an endemic illness in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of malaria cases and deaths worldwide occur.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Maternal and infant mortality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries by fertility rate (2020), according to the Population Reference Bureau\nStudies show that more than half of the world's maternal deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.[35][36] However progress has been made in this area, as maternal mortality rates have decreased for multiple countries in the region by about half since 1990.[36] Additionally, the African Union ratified the Maputo Protocol in July 2003, which pledges to prohibit female genital mutilation.[37]\n\n\nThe Sub-Saharan African region alone accounts for about 45% of global infant and child mortalities. Studies have shown a relationship between infant survival and the education of mothers, as years of education positively correlate with infant survival rates. Geographic location is also a factor, as child mortality rates are higher in rural areas in comparison to urban regions.[38]\n\n\n\n#### Measles[edit]\n\n\nRoutine immunization has been introduced to countries within Sub-Saharan Africa in order to prevent measles outbreaks within the region.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Neglected tropical diseases[edit]\n\n\nNeglected tropical diseases such as hookworm infection encompass some of the most common health conditions which affect an estimated 500 million individuals in the sub-Saharan African region.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Non-communicable diseases[edit]\n\n\nResults of Global Burden of Disease studies reveal that the age-standardized death rates of non-communicable diseases in at least four Sub-Saharan countries including South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Ethiopia supersede that of identified high-income countries.[27] Improvement in statistics systems and increase in epidemiological studies with in-depth analysis of disease risk factors could improve the understanding of non-communicable diseases (i.e.: diabetes, hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, etc.) in sub-Saharan Africa as well as better inform decisions surrounding healthcare policy in the region.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Onchocerciasis[edit]\n\n\nOnchocerciasis (\"river blindness\"), a common cause of blindness, is also endemic to parts of the region. More than 99% of people affected by the illness worldwide live in 31 countries therein.[41] In response, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) was launched in 1995 with the aim of controlling the disease.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Tuberculosis[edit]\n\n\nTuberculosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality on a global scale, especially in high HIV-prevalent populations in the sub-Saharan African region, with a high case fatality rate.[42]\n\n\n\n### National healthcare systems[edit]\n\n\nNational health systems vary between countries. In Ghana, most health care is provided by the government and largely administered by the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Services. The healthcare system has five levels of providers: health posts which are first level primary care for rural areas, health centers and clinics, district hospitals, regional hospitals and tertiary hospitals. These programs are funded by the government of Ghana, financial credits, Internally Generated Fund (IGF), and Donors-pooled Health Fund.[43]\n\n\nA shortage of health professionals compounded by migration of health workers from sub-Saharan Africa to other parts of the world (namely English-speaking nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom) has negatively impacted productivity and efficacy of the region's health systems.[44]\n\n\n\nMore than 85% of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s decade as the African Decade on African Traditional Medicine in an effort to promote The WHO African Region’s adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent.[45] Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of populations, and the social-economic development of nations within sub-Saharan Africa.[46] \n\n* ![Map of Africa colored according to the percentage of the adult (ages 15–49) population with HIV/AIDS (Map of 2002).[47]](image)\n\nMap of Africa colored according to the percentage of the adult (ages 15–49) population with HIV/AIDS (Map of 2002).[47]\n* ![Life expectancy has fallen drastically in Southern Africa a result of HIV/AIDS.[48]](image)\n\nLife expectancy has fallen drastically in Southern Africa a result of HIV/AIDS.[48]\n\n\n## Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of ethnic groups of Africa\n\nFurther information: Languages of Africa\n![](image)Yoruba drummers in Kwara State, Nigeria (2004).\n![](image)Beja nomads from Northeast AfricaSpeakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) predominate in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu farmers from West Africa's inland savanna progressively expanded over most of Africa.[49] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (San and Khoikhoi) and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Native Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the \"San\" have long been present. Together with the Khoikhoi, they form the Khoisan. The San are the pre-Bantu indigenous people of southern Africa, while Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous African peoples of Central Africa.[50]\n\n\nThe peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages belonging mostly, though not exclusively, to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic-speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in the more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara and Nilo-Saharan communities such as the Kanuri,[51][52] Zarma[52] and Songhai[52][53] are present in eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.\n\n\n\nThe peoples of North Africa comprise three main groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians and Libyans in northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The non-native Muslim settlers who arrived in the 7th century introduced the Arabic language and Islam to the region, initiating a process of linguistic Arabization of the region's inhabitants. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo-European Greeks, Romans and Vandals settled in North Africa as well.\n\nFile:Xhosa.jpgXhosa people from South AfricaBerber-speaking populations still make significant communities within Morocco and Algeria and are still also present in smaller numbers in Tunisia and Libya.[54] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small Berber community and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the South, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominates, it is also inhabited by originally Nilo-Saharan-speaking groups such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa[55] who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.\n\n![](image)Mongo family in the Province of Équateur, DRCIn the Horn of Africa, Afro-Asiatic-speaking groups predominate. Ethiopian and Eritrean groups like the Amhara and Tigrayans (collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic. In southern Ethiopia and Eritrea, Nilotic peoples related to those in South Sudan are also found, while Bantu and Khoisan ethnic minorities inhabit parts of southern Somalia near the Kenyan border.\n\n![](image)San man from Botswana.Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[56] Decolonisation during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of European-descended settlers out of Africa – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million *pieds-noirs* in North Africa),[57] Kenya, Congo,[58] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[59] By the end of 1977, more than one million Portuguese were thought to have returned from Africa.[60] Nevertheless, European Africans remain a minority in many African states, particularly South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Réunion.[61] The African country with the largest native European African population is South Africa.[62] The Boers or Afrikaners, the British diaspora and the Coloureds (multiracial) are the largest European-descended groups in Africa today.\n\n\n![](image)Afrikaner children in Namibia\n![](image)Narendra Modi greeting members of the Indian community in Nairobi, Kenya\n![](image)A Coloured family in Cape Town, South Africa\nEuropean colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly people from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and East African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are Austronesian people and native African people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). Beginning with the 21st century many Hispanics, primarily Mexicans, Central Americans, Chileans, Peruvians, and Colombians, have immigrated to Africa. Around 500,000 Hispanics have immigrated to Africa, most of whom live in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Ghana. During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[63] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[64]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Africa\n\n![Ethnic groups in Africa](image)1996 map of the major ethnolinguistic groups of Africa, by the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division (substantially based on G.P. Murdock, *Africa, its peoples and their cultural history*, 1959). Colour-coded are 15 major ethnolinguistic super-groups, as follows:  \n **Afroasiatic**  \n      Hamitic (Berber, Cushitic) + Semitic (Ethiopian, Arabic)  \n      Hausa (Chadic)  \n **Niger–Congo**  \n      Bantu  \n      \"Guinean\" (Volta-Niger, Kwa, Kru)  \n      \"Western Bantoid\" (Atlantic)  \n      \"Central Bantoid\" (Gur, Senufo)  \n      \"Eastern Bantoid\" (Southern Bantoid)  \n      Mande  \n **Nilo-Saharan** (unity debated)  \n      Nilotic  \n      Central Sudanic, Eastern Sudanic (besides Nilotic)  \n      Kanuri  \n      Songhai  \n **other**  \n      Khoi-San (unity doubtful; Khoikhoi, San, Sandawe + Hadza)  \n      Malayo-Polynesian (Malagasy)  \n      Indo-European (Afrikaaner)  \n\nThere are three major linguistic phyla native to Africa: Niger–Congo languages (including Bantu) in West, Central, Southeast and Southern Africa; Nilo-Saharan languages (unity debated) spoken from Tanzania to Sudan and from Chad to Mali; Khoisan languages (probably no phylogenetic unit, see Khoe languages), concentrated in the Kalahari Desert of Namibia and Botswana; There are several other small families and language isolates, as well as languages that have yet to be classified.\n\n\nIn addition, the Afroasiatic languages are spread throughout Western Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel. The Afroasiatic homeland may be either in Western Asia or in Africa.\n\n\nMore recently introduced to Africa are Austronesian languages spoken in Madagascar, as well as Indo-European languages spoken in South Africa and Namibia (Afrikaans, English, German), which were used as lingua francas in former European colonies.\n\n\nThe total number of languages natively spoken in Africa is variously estimated (depending on the delineation of language vs. dialect) at between 1,250 and 2,100,[65] and by some counts at \"over 3,000\",[66] Nigeria alone has over 500 languages (according to the count of SIL Ethnologue),[67]\n\n\nAround a hundred languages are widely used for inter-ethnic communication. Arabic, Somali, Berber, Amharic, Oromo, Igbo, Swahili, Hausa, Manding, Fulani and Yoruba are spoken by tens of millions of people. Twelve dialect clusters (which may group up to a hundred linguistic varieties) are spoken by 75 percent, and fifteen by 85 percent, of Africans as a first or additional language.[68]\n\n\nNiger–Congo is the largest phylum of African languages, with more than 500 million speakers (2017); it is dominated by the Bantu branch, spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa in the Bantu expansion, Bantu speakers accounting for about half of Niger–Congo speakers. Arabic is the most widely spoken single language in Africa by far, with a population of Arab Africa of the order of 330 million (2017). Other Afroasiatic languages are spoken by of the order of 100 million speakers in Africa (2017). Nilo-Saharan are spoken by of the order of 100 million speakers (2017). Khoisan groups a number of mostly endangered click languages, the largest being Khoekhoe with of the order of 300,000 speakers (2016).\n\n\nFormer colonial languages, such as English, French and Portuguese, are used as official languages in many African nations, and are spoken by a fifth of Africans.[69][70][71][a]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Religion in Africa, Traditional African religions, Islam in Africa, and Christianity in Africa\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\n\n\n* List of ethnic groups of Africa\n* Africa\n* Demographics of the world\n* Capoid\n* Congoid\n* Linguistic demographics of Africa\n* List of countries by fertility rate\n* Child marriage in Africa\n* Poverty in Africa\n* World population\n* Youth in Africa\n* Culture of Africa\n* Religion in Africa\n* Demographics of the Middle East and North Africa\n* Genetic history of Africa\n* Genetic history of North Africa\n* History of Africa\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* African cities total fertility rate\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The previous three references show that there a total of 130 million English speakers, 120 million French speakers, and over 30 million Portuguese speakers in Africa, making them about 20% of Africa's 2022 population of 1.4 billion people.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Zinkina J., Korotayev A.

Precipitous declines in fertility in Asia and Latin America, from five children per woman in the 1970s to around 2.5 today, led many to believe Africa would follow a similar course. [...] Unfortunately, since the early 1990s, family planning programmes in Africa have not had the same attention [as in other parts of the world], resulting in slow, sometimes negligible, fertility declines. In a handful of countries, previous declines have stalled altogether and are reversing. [...] A few heroic efforts, such as Family Planning 2020, are attempting to stimulate family planning programmes across the continent, and there are some signs of success. Recent figures from Kenya and Zambia show substantial strengthening of contraceptive use among married women. In Kenya, 58% of married women now use modern contraception, and in Zambia this measure has risen from 33% to 45% in the last three years. In both cases, the catalysts for improvements were government commitment and commensurate budget financing. The virtuous circle may not be completely out of reach, but many more African governments must make haste and make substantial investments in contraceptive information and access for their people.\"\n19. **^** \"Life expectancy at birth, total\".

The combined population of both China and India are estimated to be over 2.8 billion people as of 2022[update].\nAsia's population is projected to grow to 5.25 billion by 2055, or about 54% of projected world population at that time.[1] Population growth in Asia was close to 0.55% p.a. as of 2022[update], with highly disparate rates. Many Western Asian and South Asian countries have growth rates above world average, notably Pakistan at 2% p.a., while China had a small decrease of -0.06% and India had a 0.6% increase in 2022. \n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Asia population pyramid in 2023 based on the United Nations geoscheme for Asia\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Population of Asia, 1–1820 C.E.

In 2018, Europe had a total population of over 751 million people.[1][2] Russia is the most populous country in Europe, with a population of 146 million. (The population of Siberia and the Asian part of Turkey are not counted.)\n\n\nEurope's population growth is low, and its median age high. Most of Europe is in a mode of sub-replacement fertility, which means that each new(-born) generation is less populous than the one before.[3] Nonetheless, most West European countries still have growing populations, mainly due to immigration within Europe and from outside Europe and some due to increases in life expectancy and population momentum. Some current and past factors in European demography have included emigration, ethnic relations, economic immigration, a declining birth rate and an ageing population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World population estimates § By world region\n\nSee also: Medieval demography\n\nAccording to Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Helsinki, up to 7 million people lived in Europe in 3000 BC.[4]\n\n\nEstimates for historical population sizes of Europe (including Central Asia, listed under \"former USSR\") based on Maddison (2007),[5] in millions, with estimated percentage of world population:\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of Europe, in millions, by year[*citation needed*]\n| Year\n | Population(% of world total)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| AD 1\n | 34 (15%)\n |\n| 1000\n | 40 (15%)\n |\n| 1500\n | 78 (18%)\n |\n| 1600\n | 112 (20%)\n |\n| 1700\n | 127 (21%)\n |\n| 1820\n | 224 (21%)\n |\n| 1913\n | 498 (28%)\n |\n| 2000\n | 742 (13%)\n |\n\n\n### Historical population of Europe and former USSR within modern state boundaries, AD 1–2020[edit]\n\n\nSource: Maddison and others (University of Groningen)[6]\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation by year (in thousands)\n| Country/region\n | 1\n | 1000\n | 1500\n | 1600\n | 1700\n | 1820\n | 1870\n | 1913\n | 1950\n | 1973\n | 1998[6] | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Austria | 500 | 700 | 2000 | 2500 | 2500 | 3369 | 4520 | 6767 | 6935 | 7586 | 8078 | 8901 |\n| Belgium | 300 | 400 | 1400 | 1600 | 2000 | 3424 | 5096 | 7666 | 8640 | 9738 | 10197 | 11493 |\n| Denmark | 180 | 360 | 600 | 650 | 700 | 1155 | 1888 | 2983 | 4269 | 5022 | 5303 | 5823 |\n| Finland | 20 | 40 | 300 | 400 | 400 | 1169 | 1754 | 3027 | 4009 | 4666 | 5153 | 5536 |\n| France | 5000 | 6500 | 15000 | 18500 | 21471 | 31246 | 38440 | 41463 | 41836 | 52118 | 58805 | 67287 |\n| Germany | 3000 | 3500 | 12000 | 16000 | 15000 | 24905 | 39231 | 65058 | 68371 | 78956 | 82029 | 83191 |\n| Italy | 7000 | 5000 | 10500 | 13100 | 13300 | 20176 | 27888 | 37248 | 47105 | 54751 | 57592 | 59258 |\n| Netherlands | 200 | 300 | 950 | 1500 | 1900 | 2355 | 3615 | 6164 | 10114 | 13438 | 15700 | 17425 |\n| Norway | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 970 | 1735 | 2447 | 3265 | 3961 | 4432 | 5368 |\n| Sweden | 200 | 400 | 550 | 760 | 1260 | 2585 | 4164 | 5621 | 7015 | 8137 | 8851 | 10379 |\n| Switzerland | 300 | 300 | 650 | 1000 | 1200 | 1829 | 2664 | 3864 | 4694 | 6441 | 7130 | 8667 |\n| United Kingdom | 800 | 2000 | 3942 | 6170 | 8565 | 21226 | 31393 | 45649 | 50363 | 56223 | 59237 | 67886 |\n| Portugal | 500 | 600 | 1000 | 1100 | 2000 | 3297 | 4353 | 6004 | 8512 | 8634 | 9968 | 10305 |\n| Spain | 4500 | 4000 | 6800 | 8240 | 8770 | 12203 | 16201 | 20263 | 27868 | 34810 | 39371 | 47431 |\n| Greece | 2000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1500 | 1500 | 2312 |  |  | 7554 | 8929 | 10835 | 10689 |\n| 13 small countries\n | 100 | 113 | 276 | 358 | 394 | 657 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Total Western Europe\n | 24700 | 25413 | 57268 | 73778 | 81460 | 132888 | 187532 | 261007 | 305060 | 358390 | 388399 | 419639 |\n| Albania | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 300 | 437 |  |  | 1215 | 2296 | 3108 | 2878 |\n| Bulgaria | 500 | 800 | 800 | 1250 | 1250 | 2187 |  | 4200 | 7251 | 8621 | 8257 | 6917 |\n| Czechoslovakia | 1000 | 1250 | 3000 | 4500 | 4500 | 7190 |  |  | 12393 | 14563 | 15686 | 16366 |\n| -

The precise figure depends on the exact definition of the geographic extent of Europe. The population of the European Union (EU) was 509 million as of 2015.[10] Non-EU countries situated in Europe in their entirety[11] account for another 90 million. Five transcontinental countries[12] have a total of 247 million people, of which about half reside in Europe proper.\n\n\nAs it stands now, around 10% of the world's people live in Europe. If demographic trends keep their pace, its share may fall to around 7% in 2050, but still amounting to 716 million people in absolute numbers, according to the United Nations estimate.[9] (The decline in the percentage is partly due to high fertility rates in Africa and South America.) The sub-replacement fertility and high life expectancy in most European states mean a declining and aging population. High immigration and emigration levels within and from outside the continent are taking place and quickly changing countries, specifically in Western Europe, from a single ethnic group to a multicultural society. These trends change societies' economies as well as their political and social institutions.

The EU countries with the highest rates were France (1.83 live births per woman), Romania (1.80) and Czechia (1.71). The lowest rates were found in Malta (1.13), Spain (1.19) and Italy (1.24).[16]\n\n\nThe reasons that Italian citizens give for not having children are economic costs, fear of losing their jobs, and lack of services for families.[17]\n\n\nEurostat says that the proportion of children born to foreign mothers, including both from other EU member states and from non-EU countries, has been increasing in the EU since 2013 and stood at 21% in 2020.[16]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Europe\n\nFurther information: Christianity in Europe and Islam in Europe\n\nOver the last several centuries, religious practice has been on the decline in a process of secularization. Several European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance as well as a decline in the number of people professing a religious belief. The 2010 Eurobarometer survey found that, on average, 51% of the citizens of the European Union that they believe there is a God, 26% believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 20% don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer.[18] The Eurobarometer survey must be taken with caution, however, as there are discrepancies between it and national census results. For example, in the United Kingdom, the 2001 census revealed that over 70% of the population regarded themselves as \"Christians\" with only 15% professing to have no religion, though the wording of the question has been criticized as \"misleading\" by the British Humanist Association.[19] The 2011 census showed a dramatic reduction to less than 60% of the population regarding themselves as \"Christians\".[20]\n\n\nDespite its decline, Christianity is still the largest religion in Europe. According to a survey published in 2010, 76.2% of Europeans identified themselves as Christians.[21][22] Catholics were the largest Christian group in Europe, accounting for more than 48% of European Christians.[23] The second-largest Christian group in Europe was the Orthodox, who made up 32% of European Christians.[23] And about 19% of European Christians were part of the Protestant tradition. Europe constitutes in absolute terms the world's largest Christian population.[24] According to Scholars, in 2017, Europe's population was 77.8% Christian (up from 74.9% 1970),[25][26] these changes were largely result of the collapse of Communism and switching to Christianity in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.[25]\n\n\nAccording to a 2003 study,[27] 47% of French people declared themselves as agnostics in 2003. This situation is often called \"Post-Christian Europe\". A decrease in religiousness and church attendance in western Europe (especially in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden) has been noted. According to a survey published in 2012, atheists and agnostics make up about 18.2% of the European population.[28] According to the same survey the religiously unaffiliated make up the majority of the population only in two European countries: Czech Republic (75%) and Estonia (60%).[28]\n\n\nAccording to another survey about Religiosity in the European Union from 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity was the largest religion in the Union (accounting for 72% of the total population), Catholics were with 48% the largest Christian group in the Union, Protestants made up 12%, Eastern Orthodox made up 8% and other Christians accounted for 4% of the total population.[29] non-believers/agnostics accounted for 16%, atheists accounted for 7% and Muslims accounted for 2%.[30]\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Europe\n\nFurther information: White people and Immigration to Europe\n\nPan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"**peoples of Europe**\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities. The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans. (including Europeans in Siberia)[31]\n\n\nThe largest ethnic groups are the Russians, with 117 million, and the Germans, with 72 million. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Spain, the designation of nationality may controversially take on ethnic aspects, subsuming smaller ethnic groups such as Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Northern Irish, Bretons, Catalans, and Basques, making it difficult to quantify a \"British\" or \"French\" ethnicity, for example.\n\n\nApproximately 20 million non-Europeans live in the EU, 4% of the overall population.[32] There are an estimated 10 million Romani people in Europe.[33]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOverview map of the peoples of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Size and geographic distribution of the 87 peoples of Europe, according to Pan & Pfeil (2003).[34]\nFont size reflects population size (groups smaller than 2 million not to scale)\nGroups not shown due to lack of geographic concentration: Romani (3.8 million), Jews (1.3 million), Karaim (4,600).

This family is divided into a number of branches, including Romance, Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, Albanian, Celtic, Armenian and Greek. The Uralic languages, which include Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian, Udmurt, Mordvin and Sami also have a significant presence in Europe. The Turkic family also has several European members, while the North Caucasian and Kartvelian families which include Georgian, Circassian, Chechen and Abkhaz anong others are important in the southeastern extremity of geographical Europe. The Basque language of the western Pyrenees is an isolate unrelated to any other group, while Maltese is the only Semitic language in Europe with national language status, although Arabic, Hebrew and Assyrian Neo-Aramaic/Syriac are spoken by migrant populations. The Kalmyk language, is an Mongolic language, spoken in Kalmykia, located directly north of the North Caucasus in Eastern Europe. The most spoken language of Europe is Russian, which belongs to the group of Slavic languages.\n\n\nLanguages that are not official state languages are protected in many European countries by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. These can include languages spoken by relatively many people, such as Catalan and Basque in Spain, Frisian in the Netherlands, as well as languages spoken by relatively few such as Cornish Manx and Scottish Gaelic in the United Kingdom, and Romansch in Switzerland.\n\n\n\n## Genetic origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Europe\n\nSee also: Caucasian race\n\n![](image)Bronze Age spread of Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry. The Yamnaya culture is identified with the late Proto-Indo-Europeans.\n*Homo sapiens* appeared in Europe roughly 40,000 years ago, with the settlement of the Cro-Magnons, followed by European hunter-gatherers and Early European Farmers (EEF). Over the prehistoric period there was continuous settlement in Europe, notably by the immediate descendants of the Proto-Indo-Europeans who migrated west after the advent of the Neolithic revolution.[35]\n\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\nStudies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have suggested substantial genetic homogeneity of European populations,[36] with only a few geographic or linguistic isolates appearing to be genetic isolates as well.[37] On the other hand, analyses of the Y chromosome[38][39] and of autosomal diversity[40] have shown a general gradient of genetic similarity running from the southeast to the northwest of the continent.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population genomic PCA map, showing Europeans (CEU) among other sampled Eurasian populations[41]\nAccording to geneticist David Reich, based on ancient human genomes that his laboratory sequenced in 2016, Europeans formed from four West-Eurasian ancestral components in varying degrees: Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG), Neolithic Levant farmers and Neolithic Iranian farmers respectively.[42]\n\n\n\n### Population structure[edit]\n\n\nA study in May 2009[43] that examined 19 populations from Europe using 270,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highlighted the genetic diversity of European populations corresponding to the northwest to southeast gradient and distinguished \"several distinct regions\" within Europe:\n\n\n\n* Finland\n* the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), western Russia and Poland\n* Central and Western Europe\n* Italy, South-Eastern Europe, Southern Russia\n\n\nIn this study, Fst (fixation index) was found to correlate considerably with geographic distances ranging from ≤0.0010 for neighbouring populations to 0.0230 for Southern Italy and Finland. For comparisons, pair-wise Fst of non-European samples were as follows: Europeans – Yoruba (West Africans) 0.1530; Europeans – Chinese 0.1100; Yoruba (West Africans) – Chinese 0.1900.[43]: Table S2\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Area and population of European countries\n* Classical demography\n* Demographics of the European Union\n* Ethnic groups in Europe\n* European diasporas\n* European Union statistics\n* Migration from Latin America to Europe\n* List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits\n* List of urban areas of the European Union\n* List of European countries by population growth rate\n* List of European countries by population\n* List of metropolitan areas in Europe\n* Medieval demography\n* Demographics of the world\n* List of countries by fertility rate\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n**^** **a:** Continental regions as per UN categorisations/map.

Istanbul is a transcontinental city which straddles both Asia and Europe.\n* c. **^** \"Europe\" as defined by the International Monetary Fund.\n |\n\n\n**Europe** is a continent[a] comprising the westernmost peninsulas of Eurasia,[12][13] located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish straits.[14]\n\n\nEurope covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the world population) in 2021; the third-largest after Asia and Africa.[2][3] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.\n\n\nEuropean culture is the root of Western civilisation, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.[15][16] The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and the related Migration Period marked the end of Europe's ancient history, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. The Italian Renaissance began in Florence and spread to the rest of the continent, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, exploration, art, and science which contributed to the beginning of the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery, led by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world.\nBetween the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of Asia.\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. Both world wars began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence.[17] During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East, until the Revolutions of 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) and the Council of Europe are two important international organisations aiming to represent the European continent on a political level. The Council of Europe was founded in 1948 with the idea of unifying Europe[18] to achieve common goals and prevent future wars. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate supranational political entity based on a system of European law that lies between a confederation and a federation.[19] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. A majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the euro, and participate in the European single market and a customs union. A large bloc of countries, the Schengen Area, have also abolished internal border and immigration controls. Regular popular elections take place every five years within the EU; they are considered to be the second largest democratic elections in the world after India's.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information: Europa (consort of Zeus)\n\n![](image)First map of the world according to Anaximander (6th century BCE)\nIn classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: Εὐρώπη, *Eurṓpē*) was a Phoenician princess. One view is that her name derives from the Ancient Greek elements εὐρύς (*eurús*) 'wide, broad', and ὤψ (*ōps*, gen. ὠπός, *ōpós*) 'eye, face, countenance', hence their composite *Eurṓpē* would mean 'wide-gazing' or 'broad of aspect'.[20][21][22][23] *Broad* has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.[20] An alternative view is that of Robert Beekes, who has argued in favour of a Pre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from *eurus* would yield a different toponym than Europa. Beekes has located toponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece, and localities such as that of Europos in ancient Macedonia.[24]\n\n\nThere have been attempts to connect *Eurṓpē* to a Semitic term for *west*, this being either Akkadian *erebu* meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun) or Phoenician *'ereb* 'evening, west',[25] which is at the origin of Arabic *maghreb* and Hebrew *ma'arav*. Martin Litchfield West stated that \"phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor\",[26] while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages improbable.[24]\n\n\nMost major world languages use words derived from *Eurṓpē* or *Europa* to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word *Ōuzhōu* (歐洲/欧洲), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name *Ōuluóbā zhōu* (歐羅巴洲) (*zhōu* means \"continent\"); a similar Chinese-derived term *Ōshū* (欧州) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, *Ōshū Rengō* (欧州連合), despite the katakana *Yōroppa* (ヨーロッパ) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name *Frangistan* ('land of the Franks') is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as *Avrupa* or *Evropa*.[27]\n\n\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Boundaries between the continents of Earth § Asia and Europe\n\nSee also: List of transcontinental countries\n\n### Contemporary definition[edit]\n\n\nClickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries[b]   \n**Key:** **blue**: states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia;\n**green**: countries not geographically in Europe, but closely associated with the continent\n\n![](image)\nAlb.\n\nAndorra\n\nAustria\n\nAzer.\n\nBelarus\n\nBelg.\n\nBosnia\n\nBulgaria\n\n*Channel  \nIs.*\n\nCroatia\n\nCzech  \nRep.\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\n*Gib.

Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is considered part of Europe politically and it is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North-western Africa for centuries, but now it is considered to be part of Europe as well.[29] \"Europe\", as used specifically in British English, may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.[30]\n\n\nThe term \"continent\" usually implies the physical geography of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders. Prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides, the border between Europe and Asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in classical antiquity, but always as a series of rivers, seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the Mediterranean Sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges. Cartographer Herman Moll suggested in 1715 Europe was bounded by a series of partly-joined waterways directed towards the Turkish straits, and the Irtysh River draining into the upper part of the Ob River and the Arctic Ocean. In contrast, the present eastern boundary of Europe partially adheres to the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, which is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent compared to any clear-cut definition of the term \"continent\".\n\n\nThe current division of Eurasia into two continents now reflects East-West cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water. Turkey is generally considered a transcontinental country divided entirely by water, while Russia and Kazakhstan are only partly divided by waterways. France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are also transcontinental (or more properly, intercontinental, when oceans or large seas are involved) in that their main land areas are in Europe while pockets of their territories are located on other continents separated from Europe by large bodies of water. Spain, for example, has territories south of the Mediterranean Sea—namely, Ceuta and Melilla—which are parts of Africa and share a border with Morocco. According to the current convention, Georgia and Azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents.\n\n\n\n### History of the concept[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boundary between Europe and Asia\n\n#### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Depiction of *Europa regina* ('Queen Europe') in 1582\nThe first recorded usage of *Eurṓpē* as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BCE by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River on the territory of Georgia) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE.[31] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts—Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa)—with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[32] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[33] The *Book of Jubilees* described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from Northwest Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[34]\n\n\nThe convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman-era authors such as Posidonius,[35] Strabo[36] and Ptolemy,[37] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.\n\n\nThe Roman Empire did not attach a strong identity to the concept of continental divisions. However, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the culture that developed in its place, linked to Latin and the Catholic church, began to associate itself with the concept of \"Europe\".[38] The term \"Europe\" is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.\n\n\nA cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[39][40] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: *Europa* often[*dubious – discuss*] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.[41] The transition of Europe to being a cultural term as well as a geographic one led to the borders of Europe being affected by cultural considerations in the East, especially relating to areas under Byzantine, Ottoman, and Russian influence. Such questions were affected by the positive connotations associated with the term Europe by its users. Such cultural considerations were not applied to the Americas, despite their conquest and settlement by European states. Instead, the concept of \"Western civilization\" emerged as a way of grouping together Europe and these colonies.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Modern definitions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Regions of Europe and Continental Europe\n\n![](image)*A New Map of Europe According to the Newest Observations* (1721) by Hermann Moll draws the eastern boundary of Europe along the Don River flowing south-west and the Tobol, Irtysh and Ob rivers flowing north.\n![](image)1916 political map of Europe showing most of Moll's waterways replaced by von Strahlenberg's Ural Mountains and Freshfield's Caucasus Crest, land features of a type that normally defines a subcontinent\nThe question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of Muscovy began to include North Asia. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of Eurasia into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the Turkish Straits, the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and the Don (ancient Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.\n\n\nAround 1715, Herman Moll produced a map showing the northern part of the Ob River and the Irtysh River, a major tributary of the Ob, as components of a series of partly-joined waterways taking the boundary between Europe and Asia from the Turkish Straits, and the Don River all the way to the Arctic Ocean. In 1721, he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read. However, his proposal to adhere to major rivers as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers who were beginning to move away from the idea of water boundaries as the only legitimate divides between Europe and Asia.\n\n\nFour years later, in 1725, Philip Johan von Strahlenberg was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary. He drew a new line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between the Volga and Ural Rivers), then north and east along the latter waterway to its source in the Ural Mountains. At this point he proposed that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents as alternatives to nearby waterways. Accordingly, he drew the new boundary north along Ural Mountains rather than the nearby and parallel running Ob and Irtysh rivers.[43] This was endorsed by the Russian Empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted. However, this did not come without criticism. Voltaire, writing in 1760 about Peter the Great's efforts to make Russia more European, ignored the whole boundary question with his claim that neither Russia, Scandinavia, northern Germany, nor Poland were fully part of Europe.[38] Since then, many modern analytical geographers like Halford Mackinder have declared that they see little validity in the Ural Mountains as a boundary between continents.[44]\n\n\nThe mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified c. 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that once connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[45][46] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.\n\n\nBy the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a \"controversy\" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the \"best possible\", citing support from various \"modern geographers\".[47]\n\n\nIn Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[48] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[49] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[50] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest,[51] and this became the common convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.\n\n\nSome view the separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: \"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\"[52]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Europe\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Europe\n\n![](image)Last Glacial Maximum refugia, c. 20,000 years ago  \n Solutrean culture\n Epigravettian culture[53]\n\n![](image)Paleolithic cave paintings from Lascaux in France (c. 15,000 BCE)\n![](image)Stonehenge in the United Kingdom (Late Neolithic from 3000 to 2000 BCE)\nDuring the 2.5 million years of the Pleistocene, numerous cold phases called glacials (Quaternary ice age), or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in Europe and North America, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials which lasted about 10,000–15,000 years. The last cold episode of the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago.[54] Earth is currently in an interglacial period of the Quaternary, called the Holocene.[55]\n\n\n*Homo erectus georgicus*, which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominin to have been discovered in Europe.[56] Other hominin remains, dating back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[57] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago (115,000 years ago it is found already in the territory of present-day Poland[58]) and disappeared from the fossil record about 40,000 years ago,[59] with their final refuge being the Iberian Peninsula. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (Cro-Magnons), who appeared in Europe around 43,000 to 40,000 years ago.[60] Homo sapiens arrived in Europe around 54,000 years ago, some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.[61] The earliest sites in Europe dated 48,000 years ago are Riparo Mochi (Italy), Geissenklösterle (Germany) and Isturitz (France).[62][63]\n\n\nThe European Neolithic period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BCE in Greece and the Balkans, probably influenced by earlier farming practices in Anatolia and the Near East.[64] It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the Danube and the Rhine (Linear Pottery culture), and along the Mediterranean coast (Cardial culture). Between 4500 and 3000 BCE, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artifacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs.[65] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.[66][67]\n\n\nThe modern native populations of Europe largely descend from three distinct lineages:[68] Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from populations associated with the Paleolithic Epigravettian culture;[53] Neolithic Early European Farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago;[69] and Yamnaya Steppe herders who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Ukraine and southern Russia in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.[68][70] The European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BCE in Greece with the Minoan civilisation on Crete, the first advanced civilisation in Europe.[71] The Minoans were followed by the Myceneans, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BCE, ushering the European Iron Age.[72] Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BCE gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BCE, the year of the first Olympic Games.[73]\n\n\n\n### Classical antiquity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Classical antiquity\n\nSee also: Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome\n\n![](image)The Parthenon in Athens (432 BCE)\nAncient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[74] The Greek city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[74] In 508 BCE, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[75] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[76] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[77][78][79] In the course of the 5th century BCE, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,[80] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilisation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Animation showing the growth and division of Ancient Rome (years CE)\nGreece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[74] By 200 BCE, Rome had conquered Italy and over the following two centuries it conquered Greece and Hispania (Spain and Portugal), the North African coast, much of the Middle East, Gaul (France and Belgium) and Britannia (England and Wales).\n\n\nExpanding from their base in central Italy beginning in the third century BCE, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean Basin and Western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BCE, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the *pax romana*, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity and political stability in most of Europe.[81] The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.[82][83] Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 CE after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul) which was renamed Constantinople in his honour in 330 CE. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE and in 391–392 CE, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.[84] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 CE;[85] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century CE. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe.[86]\n\n\n\n### Early Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages\n\nSee also: Dark Ages and Age of Migrations\n\n![](image)\nEurope c. 650\n![](image)\nCharlemagne's empire in 814:      Francia,      Tributaries\n\nDuring the decline of the Roman Empire, Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the \"Age of Migrations\". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans and Magyars.[81] Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the \"Dark Ages\".[87]\n\n\nIsolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe, though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.[88]\n\n\nWhile the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural and military force in Europe. Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia and brought the Christian church under state control.[89]\n\n\nFrom the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due to the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid-7th century, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.[90] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.[91] Between 711 and 720, most of the lands of the Visigothic Kingdom of Iberia was brought under Muslim rule—save for small areas in the north-west (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance. In the remote regions of north-western Iberia and the middle Pyrenees the power of the Muslims in the south was scarcely felt. It was here that the foundations of the Christian kingdoms of Asturias, Leon and Galicia were laid and from where the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula would start. However, no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the Moors out. The Christian kingdoms were mainly focused on their own internal power struggles. As a result, the Reconquista took the greater part of eight hundred years, in which period a long list of Alfonsos, Sanchos, Ordoños, Ramiros, Fernandos and Bermudos would be fighting their Christian rivals as much as the Muslim invaders.\n\n\n\n![](image)Viking raids and division of the Frankish Empire at the Treaty of Verdun in 843\nDuring the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.[92] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis I.[93] Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed \"Holy Roman Emperor\" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[94]\n\n\nEast Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (c. 1000 CE). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire) and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, Kievan Rus' expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state.[95][96] Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[97]\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, and Middle Ages\n\nSee also: Medieval demography\n\n![](image)The maritime republics of medieval Italy reestablished contacts between Europe, Asia and Africa with extensive trade networks and colonies across the Mediterranean, and had an essential role in the Crusades.[98][99]\nThe period between the year 1000 and 1250 is known as the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages until c. 1500.\n\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the Renaissance of the 12th century. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the Maritime Republics a leading role in the European scene.\n\n\nThe Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages, and soon spread throughout Europe.[100] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the *Magna Carta* and the establishment of a parliament.[101] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tancred of Sicily and Philip II of France, during the Third Crusade (1189–1192)\nThe Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.[102] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the south-western peninsula.[103]\n\n\nIn the east, a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims, and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[104] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert, and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.[105][106][107][108][109][110][111][112][113] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.[114][115][116]\n\n\n\n![](image)The sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in 1238, during the Mongol invasion of Europe (1220s–1240s)\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[117] Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.[118] The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion, and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[119][120] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldavia and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[121] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480, and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.\n\n\nThe Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[122] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.[123][124] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[125] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[126] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.[127]\n\n\nThe plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in *The Decameron* (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, beggars and lepers.[128] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.[129] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.[130]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early modern period\n\nSee also: Renaissance, Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and Age of Discovery\n\n![](image)*The School of Athens* by Raphael (1511): Contemporaries, such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci (centre), are portrayed as classical scholars of the Renaissance.\nThe Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in Florence, and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin.[131][132][133] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church and an emerging merchant class.[134][135][136] Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci.[137][138]\n\n\nPolitical intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in Avignon and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.[139] In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[140][141] Exploration reached the Southern Hemisphere in the Atlantic and the Southern tip of Africa. Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492, and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East linking the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in 1498. The Portuguese-born explorer Ferdinand Magellan reached Asia westward across the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans in a Spanish expedition, resulting in the first circumnavigation of the globe, completed by the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano (1519–1522). Soon after, the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing large global empires in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.[142] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas and Asia. In 1588, a Spanish armada failed to invade England. A year later England tried unsuccessfully to invade Spain, allowing Philip II of Spain to maintain his dominant war capacity in Europe. This English disaster also allowed the Spanish fleet to retain its capability to wage war for the next decades. However, two more Spanish armadas failed to invade England (2nd Spanish Armada and 3rd Spanish Armada).[143][144][145][146]\n\n\n\n![](image)Habsburg dominions in the centuries following their partition by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The principal military base of Philip II in Europe was the Spanish road stretching from the Netherlands to the Duchy of Milan.[147]\nThe Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation in 1517 when German theologian Martin Luther nailed his *Ninety-five Theses* criticising the selling of indulgences to the church door. He was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull *Exsurge Domine* in 1520 and his followers were condemned in the 1521 Diet of Worms, which divided German princes between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[148] Religious fighting and warfare spread with Protestantism.[149] The plunder of the empires of the Americas allowed Spain to finance religious persecution in Europe for over a century.[150] The Thirty Years War (1618–1648) crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[151] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[152] The defeat of the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 marked the historic end of Ottoman expansion into Europe.[153]\n\n\nThe 17th century in Central and parts of Eastern Europe was a period of general decline;[154] the region experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[155] From the Union of Krewo (1385) east-central Europe was dominated by the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The hegemony of the vast Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had ended with the devastation brought by the Second Northern War (Deluge) and subsequent conflicts;[156] the state itself was partitioned and ceased to exist at the end of the 18th century.[157]\n\n\nFrom the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.[158] Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of contemporary Russia and Ukraine for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia).\n\n\nThe Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention and scientific development.[159] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Isaac Newton.[160] According to Peter Barrett, \"It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.\"[131]\n\n\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Modern history\n\nSee also: Industrial Revolution, French Revolution, and Age of Enlightenment\n\n![](image)The national boundaries within Europe set by the Congress of Vienna\nThe Seven Years' War brought to an end the \"Old System\" of alliances in Europe. Consequently, when the American Revolutionary War turned into a global war between 1778 and 1783, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.[161]\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts.[162][163][164] Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution, and the establishment of the First Republic as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial reign of terror.[165] Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and established the First French Empire that, during the Napoleonic Wars, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo.[166][167] Napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the nation state, as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of administration, law and education.[168][169][170] The Congress of Vienna, convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new balance of power in Europe centred on the five \"Great Powers\": the UK, France, Prussia, Austria and Russia.[171] This balance would remain in place until the Revolutions of 1848, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[172] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.[173]\n\n\nIn parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the Great Powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912–1913.[174] Formal recognition of the *de facto* independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.\n\n\n\n![](image)Marshall's Temple Works (1840); the Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain.\nThe Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment and the rise of a new working class.[175] Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the first laws on child labour, the legalisation of trade unions,[176] and the abolition of slavery.[177] In Britain, the Public Health Act of 1875 was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities.[178] Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[179] The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the Great Famine of Ireland, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people.[180] In the 19th century, 70 million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States.[181] The industrial revolution also led to large population growth, and the share of the world population living in Europe reached a peak of slightly above 25% around the year 1913.[182][183]\n\n\n\n### 20th century to the present[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Modern era and History of Europe\n\nSee also: World War I, Great Depression, Interwar period, Second World War, Cold War, and History of the European Union\n\n![](image)Map of European colonial empires throughout the world in 1914\nTwo world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. The First World War was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist[184] Gavrilo Princip.[185] Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). The war left more than 16 million civilians and military dead.[186] Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map depicting the military alliances of the First World War in 1914–1918\nRussia was plunged into the Russian Revolution, which threw down the Tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist Soviet Union,[188] leading also to the independence of many former Russian governorates, such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as new European countries.[189] Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.[190] Excess deaths in Russia over the course of the First World War and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.[191] In 1932–1933, under Stalin's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths;[192] surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour. Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;[193] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Serbian war efforts (1914–1918) cost the country one quarter of its population.[195][196][197][198][199]\n![](image)Nazi Germany began the devastating Second World War in Europe by its leader, Adolf Hitler. Here Hitler, on the right, with his closest ally, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, in 1940.\nThe social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one-party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy and in Atatürk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet and state secularism.\nEconomic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929, brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.[200][201]\n\n\nIn 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany and the Slovak Republic. At the time, the United Kingdom and France preferred a policy of appeasement.\n\n\nWith tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of Danzig, the Germans turned to the Soviets and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of the Second World War.[202][203][204] The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and, on 30 November, Finland, the latter of which was followed by the devastating Winter War for the Red Army.[205] The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The Phoney War continued.\n\n\nIn May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August, Germany had begun a bombing offensive against the United Kingdom but failed to convince the Britons to give up.[206] In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.[207] On 7 December 1941 Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the British Empire, and other allied forces.[208][209]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Big Three\" at the Yalta Conference in 1945; seated (from the left): Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin\nAfter the staggering Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The Battle of Kursk, which involved the largest tank battle in history, was the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending the Second World War in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60 million dead across the world.[210] More than 40 million people in Europe had died as a result of the Second World War,[211] including between 11 and 17 million people who perished during the Holocaust.[212] The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all Second World War casualties.[213] By the end of the Second World War, Europe had more than 40 million refugees.[214][215][216] Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20 million people.[217]\n\n\nThe First World War, and especially the Second World War, diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After the Second World War the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an \"Iron Curtain\". The United States and Western Europe established the NATO alliance and, later, the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact.[218] Particular hot spots after the Second World War were Berlin and Trieste, whereby the Free Territory of Trieste, founded in 1947 with the UN, was dissolved in 1954 and 1975, respectively. The Berlin blockade in 1948 and 1949 and the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 were one of the great international crises of the Cold War.[219][220][221]\n\n\nThe two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation. At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after the First World War, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Flag of Europe, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1955 as the flag for the whole of Europe[222]\nIn the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland weakened the previously rigid communist system. The opening of the Iron Curtain at the Pan-European Picnic then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which the Eastern bloc, the Warsaw Pact and other communist states collapsed, and the Cold War ended.[223][224][225] Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.[226] This made old previously interrupted cultural and economic relationships possible, and previously isolated cities such as Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Trieste were now again in the centre of Europe.[200][227][228][229]\n\n\nEuropean integration also grew after the Second World War. In 1949 the Council of Europe was founded, following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe[18] to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for Belarus, Russia,[230] and Vatican City. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.[231] In 1967 the EEC, European Coal and Steel Community, and Euratom formed the European Community, which in 1993 became the European Union. The EU established a parliament, court and central bank, and introduced the euro as a unified currency.[232] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central European countries began joining, expanding the EU to 28 European countries and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[233] However, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020, as a result of a June 2016 referendum on EU membership.[234] The Russo-Ukrainian conflict, which has been ongoing since 2014, steeply escalated when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, marking the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War[235] and the Yugoslav Wars.[236]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Europe\n\n![](image)Map of populous Europe and surrounding regions showing physical, political and population characteristics, as per 2018\nEurope makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass.[28] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[237] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas to the south.[238]\nLand relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.\n\n\nThis description is simplified. Subregions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean that is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Europe\n\n![](image)Biomes of Europe and surrounding regions:   \n      tundra      alpine tundra      taiga      montane forest   \n      temperate broadleaf forest      mediterranean forest      temperate steppe      dry steppe\nEurope lies mainly in the temperate climate zone of the northern hemisphere, where the prevailing wind direction is from the west. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream, an ocean current which carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic ocean to Europe.[239] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed \"Europe's central heating\", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\nTherefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Aveiro is 16 °C (61 °F), while it is only 13 °C (55 °F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (14 °F) higher than those in Calgary and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.[239]\n\n\nThe large water masses of the Mediterranean Sea, which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the Sahara desert to the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.[240]\n\n\nIn general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder from the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th, 60th, 55th, 50th, 45th and 40th latitudes. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to the sea.

For instance, Edinburgh is warmer than Belgrade during the coldest month of the year, although Belgrade is around 10° of latitude farther south.\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geology of Europe and Geological history of Europe\n\n![](image)Surficial geology of Europe\nThe geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the Baltic Shield (Fennoscandia) and the Sarmatian craton, both around 2.25 billion years ago, followed by the Volgo–Uralia shield, the three together leading to the East European craton (≈ Baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia. Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading to the formation of Pangea. Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.[243]\n\n\nThe geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling plains of Hungary.[244] Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous Southern Europe and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and Alps/Carpathians. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the Scandinavian Mountains and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the Celtic Sea, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea complex and Barents Sea.\n\n\nThe northern plain contains the old geological continent of Baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the \"main continent\", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent Avalonia.\n\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green) and tundra, or bogs, in the north (dark yellow)\nHaving lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of humans. With the exception of Fennoscandia and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various national parks.\n\n\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed forest. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift warm the continent. Southern Europe has a warm but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these, such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, are oriented east–west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south–north (Scandinavian Mountains, Dinarides, Carpathians, Apennines) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time, and the cutting down of the preagricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.\n\n\n\n![](image)Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch\nPossibly 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.[245] It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the broadleaf and mixed forests, taiga of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed rainforests of the Caucasus and the Cork oak forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, while in its Western Russia its 5–10%. The European country with the smallest percentage of forested area is Iceland (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).[246]\n\n\nIn temperate Europe, mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce–pine–birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east–west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends westwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of Europe\n\n![](image)Biogeographic regions of Europe and bordering regions\nGlaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of humans affected the distribution of European fauna. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction. The woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the Neolithic period. Today wolves (carnivores) and bears (omnivores) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, polar bears may be found on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).\n\n\n\n![](image)Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia, European bison now live in nature preserves in Białowieża Forest, on the border between Poland and Belarus.[247][248]\nOther carnivores include the European wildcat, red fox and arctic fox, the golden jackal, different species of martens, the European hedgehog, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, as well as different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).\n\n\nImportant European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly, add to the biodiversity.[249]\n\n\nSea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly phytoplankton. Important animals that live in European seas are zooplankton, molluscs, echinoderms, different crustaceans, squids and octopuses, fish, dolphins and whales.\n\n\nBiodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's Bern Convention, which has also been signed by the European Community as well as non-European states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Europe\n\nSee also: List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe, International organisations in Europe, Regions of Europe, and European integration\n\n![](image)\nA clickable Euler diagram[file] showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreements * v\n* t\n* e\n\nThe political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is parliamentary democracy, in most cases in the form of Republic; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the Monarchy. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies[250] are constitutional.\n\n\nEuropean integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the Council of Europe since the end of the Second World War. The European Union has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the Eurasian Economic Union has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.\n\n\n27 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free Schengen Area and 20 of the monetary union Eurozone. Among the smaller European organisations are the Nordic Council, the Benelux, the Baltic Assembly and the Visegrád Group.\n\n\n\n## List of states and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of

Not included are the three countries of the United Kingdom with devolved powers and the two Autonomous Regions of Portugal, which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as the Canary Islands and Heligoland, are also not included for this reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Symbol | Flag | Name\n | Sovereignstate\n | Area(km2)\n | Population | Populationdensity(per km2)\n | Capital |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Åland](image) | ![Åland](image) | Åland | Finland\n | 1,580\n | 29,489\n | 18.36\n | Mariehamn |\n| ![Bailiwick of Guernsey](image) | ![](image) | Bailiwick of Guernsey[c] | UK\n | 78\n | 65,849\n | 844.0\n | St. Peter Port |\n| ![Jersey](image) | ![Jersey](image) | Bailiwick of Jersey[c] | UK\n | 118.2\n | 100,080\n | 819\n | Saint Helier |\n| ![Faroe Islands](image) | ![Faroe Islands](image) | Faroe Islands | Denmark\n | 1,399\n | 50,778\n | 35.2\n | Tórshavn |\n| ![Gibraltar](image) | ![Gibraltar](image) | Gibraltar | UK\n | 6.7\n | 32,194\n | 4,328\n | Gibraltar |\n| ![Greenland](image) | ![Greenland](image) | Greenland | Denmark[r] | 2,166,086\n | 55,877\n | 0.028\n | Nuuk |\n| ![Isle of Man](image) | ![Isle of Man](image) | Isle of Man[c] | UK\n | 572\n | 83,314\n | 148\n | Douglas |\n|  | ![Svalbard](image) | Svalbard | Norway\n | 61,022\n | 2,667\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Europe, List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal), and List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)GDP (PPP) per capita of European countries in 2021\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|      >$60,000  |      $50,000 – $60,000  |\n|      $40,000 – $50,000  |      $30,000 – $40,000  |\n|      $20,000 – $30,000  |      $10,000 – $20,000 |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nAs a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to North America's $27.1 trillion in 2008.[251] In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.[252] As with other continents, Europe has a large wealth gap among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the Northwest and West in general, followed by Central Europe, while most economies of Eastern and Southeastern Europe are still reemerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n\nThe model of the Blue Banana was designed as an economic geographic representation of the respective economic power of the regions, which was further developed into the Golden Banana or Blue Star. The trade between East and West, as well as towards Asia, which had been disrupted for a long time by the two world wars, new borders and the Cold War, increased sharply after 1989. In addition, there is new impetus from the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative across the Suez Canal towards Africa and Asia.[253]\n\n\nThe European Union, a political entity composed of 27 European states, comprises the largest single economic area in the world. Nineteen EU countries share the euro as a common currency.\nFive European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest national economies in GDP (PPP). This includes (ranks according to the CIA): Germany (6), Russia (7), the United Kingdom (10), France (11) and Italy (13).[254]\n\n\nSome European countries are much richer than others. The richest in terms of nominal GDP is Monaco with its US$185,829 per capita (2018) and the poorest is Ukraine with its US$3,659 per capita (2019).[255]\n\n\nAs a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.[256]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *![](image) European Union*[257] | 19,226,235 | 2008\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Germany | 4,429,838 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 3,332,059 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) France | 3,049,016 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Italy[258] | 2,408,655 | 2008\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Russia | 2,288,428 | 2013\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Spain[259] | 1,631,863 | 2008\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,154,600 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Netherlands | 1,092,748 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)  Switzerland | 905,684 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Poland | 842,172 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *![](image) European Union*[260] | 25,430,409 | 2023\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Germany | 5,537,992 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Russia[261] | 5,326,855 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) United Kingdom | 3,871,790 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) France | 3,868,619 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Turkey | 3,613,540 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Italy | 3,193,180 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Spain | 2,413,066 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Poland | 1,712,629 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Netherlands | 1,297,024 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Romania | 794,055 | 2022\n |\n\n\n\n### Economic history[edit]\n\n\nIndustrial growth (1760–1945)\nCapitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.[262] From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.[263] The Industrial Revolution started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,[264] and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by the First World War, but by the beginning of the Second World War, they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. The Second World War, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.\n\n\n\nCold War (1945–1991)\n![](image)Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989\n![](image)Eurozone (blue colour)\nAfter the Second World War the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,[265] and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.[266] Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.[267] France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of Franco, also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the Spanish miracle.[268] The majority of Central and Eastern European states came under the control of the Soviet Union and thus were members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON).[269]\n\n\nThe states which retained a free-market system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the Marshall Plan.[270] The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the Cold War. Until 1990, the European Community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.\n\n\n\nReunification (1991–present)\n![](image)One of Kosovo's main economical sources is mining, because it has large reserves of lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron and bauxite.[271] Miners at the Trepča Mines in Mitrovica, Kosovo in 2011.\nWith the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states underwent shock therapy measures to liberalise their economies and implement free market reforms.\n\n\nAfter East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany, while the latter experienced sudden mass unemployment and plummeting of industrial production.\n\n\nBy the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe, comprising the five largest European economies of the time: Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the Eurozone, replacing their national currencies by the euro.\n\n\nFigures released by Eurostat in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into recession in 2008.[272] It impacted much of the region.[273] In 2010, fears of a sovereign debt crisis[274] developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.[275] As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone.[276] The EU-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012.[277] For those aged 15–24 it was 22.4%.[277]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Europe\n\nSee also: List of European countries by population, List of European countries by life expectancy, and Ageing of Europe\n\n![](image)Population growth in and around Europe in 2021[278]\nThe population of Europe was about 742 million in 2023 according to UN estimates.[2][3] This is slightly more than one ninth of the world's population.[c] The population density of Europe (the number of people per area) is the second highest of any continent, behind Asia. The population of Europe is currently slowly decreasing, by about 0.2% per year,[279] because there are fewer births than deaths. This natural decrease in population is reduced by the fact that more people migrate to Europe from other continents than vice versa.\n\n\nSouthern Europe and Western Europe are the regions with the highest average number of elderly people in the world, today they comprise 21% of the population, with over 65 years.[280] Projections suggest that by 2050 Europe will reach 30%.[281] This is caused by the fact that the population has been having children below replacement level since the 1970s. The United Nations predicts that Europe will decline its population between 2022 and 2050 by −7 per cent, without changing immigration movements.[282]\n\n\nAccording to a population projection of the UN Population Division, Europe's population may fall to between 680 and 720 million people by 2050, which would be 7% of the world population at that time.[283] Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates. The average number of children per female of child-bearing age is 1.52, far below the replacement rate.[284] The UN predicts a steady population decline in Central and Eastern Europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates.[285]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Europe\n\nFurther information: Genetic history of Europe\n\nPan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"peoples of Europe\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities.[286]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Immigration to Europe and European diaspora\n\n![](image)Map showing areas of European settlement (people who claim full European descent)\nEurope is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at nearly 87 million people in 2020, according to the International Organisation for Migration.[287] In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8 million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth.[288] In 2021, 827,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU member state, an increase of about 14% compared with 2020.[289] 2.3 million immigrants from non-EU countries entered the EU in 2021.[289]\n\n\nEarly modern emigration from Europe began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century,[290][291] and French and English settlers in the 17th century.[292] But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe.[293]\n\n\nToday, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, while most of the other Latin American countries also have a considerable population of European origins). Australia and New Zealand have large European-derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of Cape Verde and probably São Tomé and Príncipe, depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the White South Africans in South Africa. In Asia, European-derived populations, (specifically Russians), predominate in North Asia and some parts of Northern Kazakhstan.[294]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Europe\n\n![](image)Distribution of major languages of EuropeSee also: List of European languages by number of speakers\n\nEurope has about 225 indigenous languages,[295] mostly falling within three Indo-European language groups: the Romance languages, derived from the Latin of the Roman Empire; the Germanic languages, whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the Slavic languages.[243] Slavic languages are mostly spoken in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern Europe, as well as in Switzerland in Central Europe and Romania and Moldova in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Western, Northern and Central Europe as well as in Gibraltar and Malta in Southern Europe.[243] Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in English, for example). Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the Baltic group (Latvian and Lithuanian), the Celtic group (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish and Breton[243]), Greek, Armenian and Albanian.\n\n\nA distinct non-Indo-European family of Uralic languages (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Erzya, Komi, Mari, Moksha and Udmurt) is spoken mainly in Estonia, Finland, Hungary and parts of Russia. Turkic languages include Azerbaijani, Kazakh and Turkish, in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe (Balkan Gagauz Turkish, Bashkir, Chuvash, Crimean Tatar, Karachay-Balkar, Kumyk, Nogai and Tatar). Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian and Svan) are spoken primarily in Georgia. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed Northeast Caucasian, most notably including Chechen, Avar and Lezgin; and Northwest Caucasian, most notably including Adyghe). Maltese is the only Semitic language that is official within the EU, while Basque is the only European language isolate.\n\n\nMultilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Europe\n\nReligion in Europe according to the *Global Religious Landscape* survey by the Pew Forum, 2016[8]\n\n\n\nChristianity (76.2%)\nNo religion (18.3%)\nIslam (4.9%)\nBuddhism (0.2%)\nHinduism (0.2%)\nFolk religion (0.1%)\nOther religions (0.1%)\n\nThe largest religion in Europe is Christianity, with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves Christians,[296][297] including Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and various Protestant denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are Lutheranism, Anglicanism and the Reformed faith. Smaller Protestant denominations include Anabaptists as well as denominations centered in the United States such as Pentecostalism, Methodism, and Evangelicalism. Although Christianity originated in the Middle East, its centre of mass shifted to Europe when it became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the late 4th century. Christianity played a prominent role in the development of the European culture and identity.[298][299][300] Today, a bit over 25% of the world's Christians live in Europe.[301]\n\n\nIslam is the second most popular religion in Europe. Over 25 million, or roughly 5% of the population, adhere to it.[302] In Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, two countries in the Balkan peninsula in Southeastern Europe, Islam instead of Christianity is the majority religion. This is of also the case in Turkey and in certain parts of Russia, as well as in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, all of which are at the border to Asia.[302] Many countries in Europe are home to a sizeable Muslim minority, and immigration to Europe has increased the number of Muslim people in Europe in recent years.\n\n\nThe Jewish population in Europe was about 1.4 million people in 2020 (about 0.2% of the population).[303] There is a long history of Jewish life in Europe, beginning in antiquity. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian Empire had the majority of the world's Jews living within its borders.[304] In 1897, according to Russian census of 1897, the total Jewish population of Russia was 5.1 million people, which was 4.13% of total population. Of this total, the vast majority lived within the Pale of Settlement.[305] In 1933, there were about 9.5 million Jewish people in Europe, representing 1.7% of the population,[306] but most were killed or displaced across Europe during The Holocaust.[307][303] In the 21st century, France has the largest Jewish population in Europe, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia.[8]\n\n\nOther religions practiced in Europe include Hinduism and Buddhism, are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's Republic of Kalmykia).\n\n\nA large and increasing number people in Europe are irreligious, atheist and agnostic. They are estimated to make up about 18.3% of Europe's population currently.[8]\n\n\n\n### Major cities and urban areas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of European cities by population within city limits\n\nThe three largest urban areas of Europe are Moscow, London and Paris. All have over 10 million residents,[308] and as such have been described as megacities.[309] While Istanbul has the highest total city population, it lies partly in Asia. 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side.\nThe next largest cities in order of population are Madrid, Saint Petersburg, Milan, Barcelona, Berlin, and Rome each having over three million residents.[308]\n\n\nWhen considering the commuter belts or metropolitan areas, within Europe (for which comparable data is available) Moscow covers the largest population, followed in order by Istanbul, London, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Ruhr Area, Saint Petersburg, Rhein-Süd, Barcelona and Berlin.[310]\n\n\n\nEuropean megacities\n![Moscow International Business Center](image)\nMoscow\n![City of London](image)\nLondon\n![](image)\nParis\n![Levent](image)\nIstanbul[b]\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Europe\n\nFurther information: European folklore and European art\n\n![](image)Map purportedly displaying the European continent split along cultural and state borders as proposed by the German organisation Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen [] (StAGN)\n\"Europe\" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire and its cultures. The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of Christendom (or more specifically Latin Christendom), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially against Islam, as in the Reconquista and the Ottoman wars in Europe.[311]\n\n\nThis shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into Slavic, Latin (Romance) and Germanic, but with several components not part of either of these group (notably Greek, Basque and Celtic). Historically, special examples with overlapping cultures are Strasbourg with Latin (Romance) and Germanic or Trieste with Latin, Slavic and Germanic roots.\nCultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of Europe. Europe is often described as \"maximum cultural diversity with minimal geographical distances\".\n\n\nDifferent cultural events are organised in Europe, with the aim of bringing different cultures closer together and raising awareness of their importance, such as the European Capital of Culture, the European Region of Gastronomy, the European Youth Capital and the European Capital of Sport.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Sport in Europe.[edit]\n![](image)Football is by far the most popular sport in Europe. This picture shows Camp Nou in Barcelona before the 2023 renovation works started.\nSport in Europe tends to be highly organized with many sports having professional leagues.\n\n\n\nThe origins of many of the world's most popular sports today lie in the codification of many traditional games, especially in the United Kingdom. However, a paradoxical feature of European sport is the extent to which local, regional and national variations continue to exist, and even in some instances to predominate.[312]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n\n\nMain articles: List of Europe-related articles and Outline of Europe\n\nHistory\n* Baltica\n* Genetic history of Europe\n* Prehistoric Europe\n* Classical antiquity\n* Middle Ages\n* Early modern Europe\n* Modernity\n* History of Europe\n\n\nPolitics\n* Eurodistrict\n* Euroregion\n* Flags of Europe\n* List of sovereign states by date of formation\n* Names of European cities in different languages\n* OSCE countries statistics\n* European Union as a potential superpower\n\n\nDemographics\n* Area and population of European countries\n* Demographics of Europe\n* European Union statistics\n* List of European cities by population within city limits\n* List of urban areas in the European Union\n* List of cities in Europe\n* List of metropolitan areas in Europe\n* List of villages in Europe\n* Pan-European identity\n\n\nEconomics\n* Economy of the European Union\n* Financial and social rankings of European countries\n* Healthcare in Europe\n* Telecommunications in Europe\n* List of European television stations\n* List of European countries by GDP (nominal)\n\n\nCulture\n* European Capital of Culture\n* European Region of Gastronomy\n* European Youth Capital\n\n\nSports\n* European Games\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Europe is normally considered its own continent in the English-speaking world, which uses the seven continent model.[10][11] Other models consider Europe as part of a Eurasian or Afro-Eurasian continent. See Continent § Number for more information.\n2. **^** The map shows one of the most commonly accepted delineations of the geographical boundaries of Europe, as used by National Geographic and Encyclopædia Britannica. Whether countries are considered in Europe or Asia can vary in sources, for example in the classification of the CIA World Factbook or that of the BBC. Certain countries in Europe, such as France, have territories lying geographically outside Europe, but which are nevertheless considered integral parts of that country.\n3. **^** This number includes Siberia, (about 38 million people) but excludes European Turkey (about 12 million).\n\n1. ^ ***a b*** Transnistria, internationally recognised as being a legal part of the Republic of Moldova, although *de facto* control is exercised by its internationally unrecognised government which declared independence from Moldova in 1990.\n2. **^** Russia is a transcontinental country spanning Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. The vast majority of its population (80%) lives within its European part.[313] However, only the population figure includes the entire state.\n3. ^ ***a b c*** Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey are Crown Dependencies of the United Kingdom. Other Channel Islands legislated by the Bailiwick of Guernsey include Alderney and Sark.\n4. ^ ***a b*** Cyprus can be considered part of Europe or Western Asia; it has strong historical and sociopolitical connections with Europe. The population and area figures refer to the entire state, including the *de facto* independent part Northern Cyprus which is not recognised as a sovereign nation by the vast majority of sovereign nations, nor the UN.\n5. **^** Figures for Portugal include the Azores and Madeira archipelagos, both in Northern Atlantic.\n6. **^** Area figure for Serbia includes Kosovo, a province that unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, and whose sovereign status is unclear. Population and density figures are from the first results of 2011 census and are given without the disputed territory of Kosovo.\n7. **^** Figures for France include only metropolitan France: some politically integral parts of France are geographically located outside Europe.\n8. **^** Netherlands population for November 2014. Population and area details include European portion only: Netherlands and three entities outside Europe (Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean) constitute the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Amsterdam is the official capital, while The Hague is the administrative seat.\n9. **^** Kazakhstan is physiographically considered a transcontinental country, mostly in Central Asia (UN region), partly in Eastern Europe, with European territory west of the Ural Mountains and Ural River. However, only the population figure refers to the entire country.\n10. **^** Armenia can be considered part of Eastern Europe or Western Asia; it has strong historical and sociopolitical connections with Europe. The population and area figures include the entire state, respectively.\n11. **^** Azerbaijan is physiographically considered a transcontinental country, mostly in Western Asia. A small portion of its territory is located north of Greater Caucasus, considered part of Eastern Europe.[314] However the population and area figures are for the entire state. This includes the exclave of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and the region Nagorno-Karabakh that has declared, and *de facto* achieved, independence. Nevertheless, it is not recognised *de jure* by sovereign states.\n12. **^** Georgia can be considered part of Eastern Europe or West Asia; it has strong historical and sociopolitical connections with Europe.[315] The population and area figures include Georgian estimates for Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two regions that have declared and *de facto* achieved independence. International recognition, however, is limited.\n13. **^** Turkey is physiographically considered a transcontinental country, mostly in Western Asia (the Middle East). Turkey has a small part of its territory (3%) in Southeast Europe called Turkish Thrace.[316] However, only the population figure includes the entire state.\n14. ^ ***a b c d*** The total figures for area and population include only European portions of transcontinental countries. The precision of these figures is compromised by the ambiguous geographical extent of Europe and the lack of references for European portions of transcontinental countries.\n15. **^** Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008. Its sovereign status is unclear. Its population is July 2009 CIA estimate.\n16. ^ ***a b*** Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which can be considered part of Eastern Europe or West Asia[317] unilaterally declared their independence from Georgia on 25 August 1990 and 28 November 1991, respectively. Their status as sovereign nations is not recognised by a vast majority of sovereign nations, nor the UN. Population figures stated as of 2003 census and 2000 estimates, respectively.\n17. **^** Nagorno-Karabakh, which can be considered part of Eastern Europe or West Asia, unilaterally declared its independence from Azerbaijan on 6 January 1992. Its status as a sovereign nation is not recognised by any sovereign nation, nor the UN. Population figures stated as of 2003 census and 2000 estimates, respectively.\n18. **^** Greenland, an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm, is geographically a part of the continent of North America, but has been politically and culturally associated with Europe.\n19. ^ ***a b*** The Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic are internationally recognised as being a legal part of Ukraine, although *de facto* control is exercised by governments which declared independence from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Largest Countries In Europe 2020\". *worldpopulationreview.com*.

The region includes Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America, Greenland, Mexico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the United States.\n\n\nNorth America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), representing approximately 16.5% of the Earth's land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after Asia and Africa, and the fourth-largest continent by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. As of 2013[update], North America's population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population. In human geography and in the English-speaking world outside the United States, particularly in Canada, the terms \"North America\" and \"North American\" are typically defined as including just Canada and the United States.[6][7][8][9][10]\n\n\nThe first human populations reached North America during the Last Glacial Period approximately 20,000 to 17,000 years ago, during which they crossed the Bering land bridge in the Bering Strait on their way to reaching North America. The Paleo-Indian period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago when the Archaic period began. The classic stage followed the Archaic period, and lasted from approximately the 6th to 13th centuries. Beginning in 1000 AD, the Norse were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America.\n\n\nIn 1492, the exploratory voyages of Christopher Columbus led to a transatlantic exchange, including migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, African slaves, immigrants from Europe, Asia, and descendants of these respective groups.\n\n\nEurope's colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, and the cultures of the region commonly reflect Western traditions. However, relatively small parts of North America in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre-European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information: Naming of the Americas, New Spain, Turtle Island (Native American folklore), and Vinland\n\n![](image)A 1621 map of North America\nThe Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann.[11] Vespucci explored South America between 1497 and 1502, and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass not then known to Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller published a world map, and placed the word \"America\" on the continent of present-day South America.[12] The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias.[13] On a 1553 world map published by Petrus Apianus,[14] North America was called \"Baccalearum\", meaning \"realm of the Cod fish\", in reference to the abundance of cod fish on the East Coast.[15]\n\n\nWaldseemüller used the Latin version of Vespucci's name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of \"America\", following the examples of \"Europa\", \"Asia\", and \"Africa\". Map makers later extended the name America to North America.\n\n\nIn 1538, Gerardus Mercator used the term America on his world map of the entire Western Hemisphere.[16] On his subsequent 1569 map, Mercator called North America \"America or New India\" (*America sive India Nova*).[17]\n\n\nThe Spanish Empire called its territories in North and South America \"Las Indias\", and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the Council of the Indies.\n\n\n\n## Definitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 2005 NASA satellite image of North America\nThe United Nations and its statistics division recognize North America as including three regions: Northern America, Central America, and the Caribbean.[18] \"Northern America\" is a distinct term from \"North America\", excluding Central America, which itself may or may not include Mexico. In the limited context of regional trade agreements, the term is used to reference three nations, Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\n\n\nFrance, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Greece, and the countries of Latin America use a six-continent model, with the Americas viewed as a single continent and *North America* designating a subcontinent comprising Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (politically part of France), and often including Greenland and Bermuda.[19][20][21][22][23]\n\n\nNorth America has historically been known by other names, including Spanish North America, New Spain, and América Septentrional, the first official name given to Mexico.[24]\n\n\n\n### Regions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of regions of Canada and List of regions of the United States\n\nNorth America includes several regions and subregions, each of which have their own respective cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions include several regions formalized in 20th and 21st century trade agreements, including NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and CAFTA between Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.\n\n\nNorth America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions, Anglo-America and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of North America, Belize, and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations, though subnational entities, including Louisiana and Quebec, have large Francophone populations; in Quebec, French is the official language.[25].\n\n\nThe southern portion of North America includes Central America and non-English speaking Caribbean nations.[26][27] The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of North America, which encompasses the whole North American continent, the term \"North America\" is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the U.S.[28][29][30][31][32]\n\n\nThe term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America: the U.S., Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, and St. Pierre and Miquelon.[33][34] Although the term does not refer to a unified region,[35] Middle America includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.[36]\n\n\nNorth America's largest countries by land area are Canada and the U.S., both of which have well-defined and recognized subregions. In Canada, these include (from east to west) Atlantic Canada, Central Canada, Canadian Prairies, the British Columbia Coast, and Northern Canada. In the U.S., they include New England, the Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic states, East North Central states, West North Central states, East South Central states, West South Central states, Mountain states, and Pacific states.

The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by Hudson Bay. Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California.\n\n\nBefore the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge, which had connected North and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela.\n\n\nThere are several islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, the Aleutian Islands (some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere proper), the Alexander Archipelago, the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the world's largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American Plate) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago (mya). The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent.\n\n\nThe vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of California, including the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz, lie on the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate, with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas fault. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the Caribbean Plate, whereas the Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates border the North American Plate on its western frontier.\n\n\nThe continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, California and Alaska; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long plateaus and cordilleras, falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.\n\n\nThe western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is Denali in Alaska.\n\n\nThe U.S. Geographical Survey (USGS) states that the geographic center of North America is \"6 miles [10 km] west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota\" at about 48°10′N 100°10′W﻿ / ﻿48.167°N 100.167°W﻿ / 48.167; -100.167, about 24 kilometers (15 mi) from Rugby, North Dakota. The USGS further states that \"No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 states, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.\"[51] Nonetheless, there is a 4.6-meter (15 ft) field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located 1,650 km (1,030 mi) from the nearest coastline, between Allen and Kyle, South Dakota at 43°22′N 101°58′W﻿ / ﻿43.36°N 101.97°W﻿ / 43.36; -101.97﻿ (Pole of Inaccessibility North America).[52]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of North America\n\n#### Geologic history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The principal water divisions in Canada, the United States, and Mexico\nLaurentia is an ancient craton which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon.[53] The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea, with Eurasia to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains, which formed some 480 mya, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 mya, North America became part of Laurasia, before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period.[54] The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny, between 80 and 55 mya. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 mya,[55] and the Great Lakes (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.\n\n\nNorth America is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods.[56] The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country.[56] According to paleontologist Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.[56] Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.[56] The most significant Late Jurassic dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison Formation of the western U.S.[57]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Canada\n\n![](image)A geologic map of North America published by the U.S. Geographical Survey\nCanada is geographically one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of Precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era.[58] Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.[58] Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,[59] making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield, there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[60] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States\n\nThe lower 48 U.S. states can be divided into roughly five physiographic provinces:\n\n\n\n1. The American cordillera\n2. The Canadian Shield[58] Northern portion of the upper midwestern U.S.\n3. The stable platform\n4. The coastal plain\n5. The Appalachian orogenic belt\n\n\nThe geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA 2003 image of North America's bedrock and terrain\n![](image)\nA 2015 map of North America's cratons and basement rocks\n\n#### Central America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Central America\n\n![](image)Central America rests on the Caribbean Plate.\nCentral America is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake, killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.\n\n\nVolcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n\nCentral America has many mountain ranges; the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia, and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Köppen climate classification map of North America\nNorth America is a very large continent that extends from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Tropic of Cancer. Greenland, along with the Canadian Shield, is tundra with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F), but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes.\nClimate west of the Cascade Range is described as being temperate weather with average precipitation 20 inches (510 millimeters).[61]\nClimate in coastal California is described to be Mediterranean, with average temperatures in cities like San Francisco ranging from 57 to 70 °F (14 to 21 °C) over the course of the year.[62]\n\n\nStretching from the East Coast to eastern North Dakota, and stretching down to Kansas, is the humid continental climate featuring intense seasons, with a large amount of annual precipitation, with places like New York City averaging 50 in (1,300 mm).[63]\nStarting at the southern border of the humid continental climate and stretching to the Gulf of Mexico (whilst encompassing the eastern half of Texas) is the humid subtropical climate. This area has the wettest cities in the contiguous U.S., with annual precipitation reaching 67 in (1,700 mm) in Mobile, Alabama.[64]\nStretching from the borders of the humid continental and subtropical climates, and going west to the Sierra Nevada, south to the southern tip of Durango, north to the border with tundra climate, the steppe/desert climates are the driest in the United States.[65] Highland climates cut from north to south of the continent, where subtropical or temperate climates occur just below the tropics, as in central Mexico and Guatemala. Tropical climates appear in the island regions and in the subcontinent's bottleneck, found in countries and states bathed by the Caribbean Sea or to the south of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.[66] Precipitation patterns vary across the region, and as such rainforest, monsoon, and savanna types can be found, with rains and high temperatures throughout the year.\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

They lived in several culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there, including the bison hunters of the Great Plains and the farmers of Mesoamerica. Native groups also are classified by their language families, which included Athapascan and Uto-Aztecan languages. Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, however, and were not necessarily always allies. Anthropologists speculate that the Inuit of the high Arctic arrived in North America much later than other native groups, evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people.\n\n\nDuring the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest yet discovered is the Clovis culture (c. 9550–9050 BCE) in modern New Mexico.[76] Later groups include the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures, found in the Mississippi River valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the Four Corners. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes, squash, and maize. As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many other cultural advances were made there. The Mayans developed a writing system, built huge pyramids and temples, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE.[80]\n\n\nThe first recorded European references to North America are in Norse sagas where it is referred to as Vinland.[81] The earliest verifiable instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by any European culture with the North America mainland has been dated to around 1000 CE.[82] The site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named Newfoundland, has provided unmistakable evidence of Norse settlement.[83] Norse explorer Leif Erikson (c. 970–1020 CE) is thought to have visited the area.[j] Erikson was the first European to make landfall on the continent (excluding Greenland).[85][86]\n\n\nThe Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire, whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hernán Cortés.[87]\n\n\n\n### Post-contact, 1492–1910[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European colonization of the Americas\n\nFurther information: Timeline of the European colonization of North America, British America, French America, New Spain, and Russian colonization of the Americas\n\n![](image)A 1702 map of North America showing forts, towns, and (in solid colors) areas occupied by European colonial settlements\nDuring the so-called Age of Discovery, Europeans explored overseas and staked claims to various parts of North America, much of which was already settled by indigenous peoples. Upon Europeans' arrival in the \"New World\", indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions, including curiosity, trading, cooperation, resignation, and resistance. The indigenous population declined substantially following European arrival, primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity, and because of violent conflicts with Europeans.[88] Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups died out, and others changed quite quickly.\n\n\nOn the North America's southeastern coast, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León, who had accompanied Columbus's second voyage, visited and named in 1513 *La Florida*.[89] As the colonial period unfolded, Spain, England, and France appropriated and claimed extensive territories in North America eastern and southern coastlines. Spain established permanent settlements on the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba in the 1490s, building cities, putting the resident indigenous populations to work, raising crops for Spanish settlers and panning gold to enrich the Spaniards. Much of the indigenous population died due to disease and overwork, spurring the Spaniards on to claim new lands and peoples. An expedition under the command of Spanish settler, Hernán Cortés, sailed westward in 1519 to what turned out to be the mainland in Mexico. With local indigenous allies, the Spanish conquered the Aztec empire in central Mexico in 1521. Spain then established permanent cities in Mexico, Central America, and Spanish South America in the sixteenth century. Once Spaniards conquered the high civilization of the Aztecs and Incas, the Caribbean was a backwater of the Spanish empire.\n\n\nOther European powers began to intrude on areas claimed by Spain, including the Caribbean islands. France took the western half of Hispaniola and developed Saint-Domingue as a cane sugar producing colony worked by black slave labor. Britain took Barbados and Jamaica, and the Dutch and Danes took islands previously claimed by Spain. Britain did not begin settling on the North American mainland until a hundred years after the first Spanish settlements, since it sought first to control nearby Ireland.\n\n\n\n### English settlements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British America\n\nThe first permanent English settlement was in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, followed by additional colonial establishments on the east coast from present-day Georgia in the south to Massachusetts in the north, forming the Thirteen Colonies of British America. The English did not establish settlements north or east of the St. Lawrence Valley in present-day Canada until after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. Britain's early settlements in present-day Canada included St. John's, Newfoundland in 1630 and Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1749. The first permanent French settlement was in Quebec City, Quebec in 1608\n\n\n\n### Seven Years' War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seven Years' War\n\nWith the British victory in the Seven Years' War, France in 1763 ceded to Britain its claims of North American territories east of the Mississippi River. Spain, in turn, gained rights to the territories west of Mississippi, which then served as a border between Spain and Britain's territorial claims. French colonists settled Illinois Country after several generations of experience on North America, migrating over the Mississippi River to regions where Spain was not present and where they were able to leverage their earlier Louisiana French settlements around the Gulf of Mexico. These early French settlers partnered with midwest indigenous tribes, and their mixed ancestry descendants later followed a westward expansion all the way to the Pacific Ocean on the present-day U.S. West Coast.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American Revolution and American Revolutionary War\n\nIn 1776, after various attempts to reconcile differences with the British, the Thirteen Colonies in British America sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, who unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring it. In the Declaration, the thirteen colonies declared their independence from the British monarchy, then governed by King George III, and detailed the factors that contributed to their decision. With the signing and issuance of the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen colonies formalized and escalated the American Revolutionary War, which had begun the year before at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Gathered in Philadelphia following the war's outbreak, delegates from the thirteen colonies established the Continental Army from various patriot militias then engaged in resisting the British, and appointed George Washington as the Continental Army's military commander.\n\n\nAs the American Revolutionary War progressed, France and Spain, both then enemies of Britain, began to ultimately see the promise of a potential American victory in the war and began supporting Washington and the American Revolutionary cause. The British Army, in turn, was supported by Hessian military units from present-day Germany.\n\n\nIn 1783, after an eight-year attempt to defeat the American rebellion, King George III acknowledged Britain's defeat in the war, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783, which solidified the sovereign establishment of the United States.\n\n\n\n### Westward expansion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Westward Expansion Trails\n\nFurther information: Lewis and Clark Expedition, Louisiana Purchase, and United States Exploring Expedition\n\nBy the late 18th century, Russia was established on the Pacific Northwest northern coastline, where it was engaged in maritime fur trade and was supported by various indigenous settlements in the region. As a result, the Spanish were showing more interest in controlling the trade on the Pacific coast and mapped most of its coastline. The first Spanish settlements were attempted in Alta California during that period. Numerous overland explorations associated with voyageurs, fur trade, and U.S. led expeditions, including the Lewis and Clark, Fremont and Wilkes expeditions, reached the Pacific.\n\n\nIn 1803, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, Napoleon Bonaparte sold France's remaining North American territorial claims, which included regions west of the Mississippi River, to the U.S., in the Louisiana Purchase. Spain and the U.S. settled their western boundary dispute in 1819 in the Adams–Onís Treaty. Mexico fought a lengthy war for independence from Spain, winning it for Mexico (which included Central America at the time) in 1821. The U.S. sought further westward expansion and fought the Mexican–American War, gaining a vast territory that first Spain and then Mexico claimed but which they did not effectively control. Much of the area was in fact dominated by indigenous peoples, which did not recognize the claims of Spain, France, or the U.S. Russia sold its North American claims, which included the present-day U.S. state of Alaska, to the U.S. in 1867.\n\n\n\n### Canada and Panama Canal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Canada and Panama Canal\n\nIn 1867, colonial settlers north of the United States, unified as the dominion of Canada. The U.S. sought to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama in present-day Panama in Central America, then a part of present-day Colombia. The U.S. aided Panamanians in a war that resulted in its separation from Colombia. The U.S. subsequently carved out the Panama Canal Zone, and claimed sovereignty over it. After decades of work, the Panama Canal was completed, which connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in 1913 and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by population and List of North American countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Non-native nations' control and claims over North America, c. 1750 to 2008\nCanada and the United States are the wealthiest and most developed nations on the continent followed by Mexico, a newly industrialized country.[90] The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development. For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher GDP (PPP) per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations.[91] Additionally, despite Greenland's vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.[92]\n\n\nDemographically, North America is ethnically diverse. Its three main groups are Whites, Mestizos and Blacks.[93] There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups.[93]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of North America\n\n![](image)Native languages of the United States, Canada, Greenland, and Northern Mexico\nThe dominant languages in North America are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic, and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the U.S., but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the Commonwealth Caribbean. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the U.S.) where the Romance languages, derived from Latin, of Spanish and Portuguese, (but French-speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana [France], and the Falkland Islands [UK]).\n\n\nThe French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of New Brunswick. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of Ontario (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of Manitoba (co-official as *de jure* with English), the French West Indies and Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, as well as the U.S. state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English.\n\n\nA significant number of Indigenous languages are spoken in North America, with 372,000 people in the U.S. speaking an indigenous language at home,[94] about 225,000 in Canada[95] and roughly 6 million in Mexico.[96] In the U.S. and Canada, there are approximately 150 surviving indigenous languages of the 300 spoken prior to European contact.[97]\n\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in North America\n\nSee also: Religions of the world\n\n![](image)The percentage of people who identify with a religion in North America, according to 2010–2012 data\nChristianity is the largest religion in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of the population considered themselves Christians.[98] Christianity also is the predominant religion in the 23 dependent territories in North America.[99] The U.S. has the largest Christian population in the world, with nearly 247 million Christians (70%), although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations.[100] Mexico has the world's second largest number of Catholics, surpassed only by Brazil.[101]\n\n\nAccording to the same study, the religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 17% of the population of Canada and the U.S.[102] Those with no religious affiliation make up about 24% of Canada's total population.[103]\n\n\nCanada, the U.S. and Mexico host communities of Jews (6 million or about 1.8%),[104] Buddhists (3.8 million or 1.1%)[105] and Muslims (3.4 million or 1.0%).[106] The largest number of Jews can be found in the U.S. (5.4 million),[107] Canada (375,000)[108] and Mexico (67,476).[109] The U.S. hosts the largest Muslim population in North America with 2.7 million or 0.9%,[110][111] while Canada hosts about one million Muslims or 3.2% of the population.[112] In Mexico there were 3,700 Muslims in 2010.[113] In 2012, *U-T San Diego* estimated U.S. practitioners of Buddhism at 1.2 million people, of whom 40% are living in Southern California.[114]\n\n\nThe predominant religion in Mexico and Central America is Christianity (96%).[115] Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was the only religion permitted by Spanish crown and Catholic church. A vast campaign of religious conversion, the so-called \"spiritual conquest\", was launched to bring the indigenous peoples into the Christian fold. The Inquisition was established to assure orthodox belief and practice. The Catholic Church remained an important institution, so that even after political independence, Roman Catholicism remained the dominant religion. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion. Christianity is also the predominant religion in the Caribbean (85%).[115] Other religious groups in the region are Hinduism, Islam, Rastafari (in Jamaica), and Afro-American religions such as Santería and Vodou.\n\n\n\n### Populace[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by population, List of North American cities by population, and List of North American metropolitan areas by population\n\nNorth American cities\n![](image)\nMexico City\n![](image)\nLos Angeles\n![](image)\nToronto\n![](image)\nChicago\n![](image)\nNew York City\n![](image)\nGuadalajara\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in North America in 2021\nNorth America is the fourth most populous continent after Asia, Africa, and Europe.[116] Its most populous country is the U.S. with 329.7 million persons. The second largest country is Mexico with a population of 112.3 million.[117] Canada is the third most populous country with 37.0 million.[118] The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico (a territory of the U.S.), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million.[119][120][121][122][123] Greenland has a small population of 55,984 for its massive size (2,166,000 km2 or 836,300 mi2), and therefore, it has the world's lowest population density at 0.026 pop./km2 (0.067 pop./mi2).[124]\n\n\nWhile the U.S., Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto,[125] Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the U.S. border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is Tijuana, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages.[126]\n\n\nEight of the top ten metropolitan areas are located in the U.S. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the New York City metropolitan area, Los Angeles metropolitan area, Chicago metropolitan area, and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.[127] Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the U.S., Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America: Greater Mexico City.[128] Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million people.[129] The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada–United States border and the Mexico–U.S. border has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas. These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most productive in Detroit–Windsor and San Diego–Tijuana and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego-Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20 billion.[130][131]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Megaregions of the United States\n\nNorth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In the U.S. exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the Arizona Sun Corridor, Cascadia, Florida, Front Range, Great Lakes Megalopolis, Gulf Coast, Northeast, Northern California, Piedmont Atlantic, Southern California, and the Texas Triangle.[132] Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, Golden Horseshoe—both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis—and the Central Mexico megalopolis. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, DC Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet megaregion criterion have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.[133]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top ten largest North American metropolitan areas by population as of 2013, based on national census numbers from the U.S. and census estimates from Canada and Mexico\n| **Metro Area** | **Population** | **Area** | **Country** |\n| Mexico City | 21,163,226† | 7,346 km2 (2,836 sq mi)\n | Mexico\n |\n| New York City | 19,949,502\n | 17,405 km2 (6,720 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Los Angeles | 13,131,431\n | 12,562 km2 (4,850 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Chicago | 9,537,289\n | 24,814 km2 (9,581 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Dallas–Fort Worth | 6,810,913\n | 24,059 km2 (9,289 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Houston | 6,313,158\n | 26,061 km2 (10,062 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Toronto | 6,054,191† | 5,906 km2 (2,280 sq mi)\n | Canada\n |\n| Philadelphia | 6,034,678\n | 13,256 km2 (5,118 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Washington, DC | 5,949,859\n | 14,412 km2 (5,565 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n| Miami | 5,828,191\n | 15,896 km2 (6,137 sq mi)\n | United States\n |\n\n\n†2011 Census figures\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of North America\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by GDP (nominal) and List of North American countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sign the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement during the 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit\n![](image)The regions of the world respective wealth (in trillions USD) as of 2018\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country or territory\n | GDP[134] (PPP, peak year)millions of USD | Peak year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States | 26,949,643 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Mexico | 3,277,601 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Canada | 2,378,973 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Dominican Republic | 273,703 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Cuba | 254,865 | 2015\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Guatemala | 201,365 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Panama | 190,306 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Costa Rica | 141,527 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Puerto Rico | 132,052 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Honduras | 75,030 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country or territory\n | GDP (nominal, peak year)millions of USD | Peak year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) United States | 26,949,643 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Canada[135] | 2,139,840 | 2022\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Mexico | 1,811,468 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Cuba[136] | 545,218 | 2021\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Dominican Republic | 120,629 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Puerto Rico | 117,515 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Guatemala | 102,765 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Costa Rica | 85,590 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Panama | 82,348 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) El Salvador | 35,339 | 2023\n |\n\n\nNorth America's GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be $41,830, making it the richest continent in the world,[137] followed by Oceania.[138]\n\n\nCanada, Mexico, and the U.S. have significant and multifaceted economic systems. The U.S. has the largest economy of all three countries and in the world.[138] In 2016, the U.S. had an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $57,466 according to the World Bank, and is the most technologically developed economy of the three.[139] The U.S.'s services sector comprises 77% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22% and agriculture comprises 1.2%.[138] The U.S. economy is also the fastest growing economy in North America and the Americas as a whole,[140][137] with the highest GDP per capita in the Americas as well.[137]\n\n\nCanada shows significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing.[141] Canada's per capita GDP (PPP) was estimated at $44,656 and it had the 11th largest GDP (nominal) in 2014.[141] Canada's services sector comprises 78% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%.[141] Mexico has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $16,111 and as of 2014 is the 15th largest GDP (nominal) in the world.[142] Being a newly industrialized country,[90] Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations.[143] Its main sources of income are oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.[144]\n\n\nThe North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas.[145] These areas are those under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), and the Central American Common Market (CACM).[145] Of these trade blocs, the U.S. takes part in two. In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement among numerous other free-trade relations, often between the larger, more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries.\n\n\nNAFTA formed one of the four largest trade blocs in the world.[146] Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.[147] While Canada and the U.S. already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship—and to present day still do—in the world and Canada–U.S. trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs,[148] NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty-free trade. The free-trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on U.S.–Mexico trade. Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion.[149] The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617 trillion.[150] This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U.S. is the world's largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010.[151] The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other's largest trade partners. The U.S. is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico,[152] while Canada and Mexico are each other's third largest trade partners.[153][154] In 2018, the NAFTA was replaced by the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement.\n\n\nThe Caribbean trade bloc (CARICOM) came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free-trade agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations free-trade agreements have been signed into effect.\n\n\nIntegration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. The 2006 implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) left the future of the CACM unclear.[155] The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the U.S., Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs.\n\n\nThese nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the G3 Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The U.S. has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free Trade Area between itself and the European Union; the U.S.–Middle East Free Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in North America\n\n![](image)A 2006 map of the North American Class I railroad network\nThe Pan-American Highway route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000 km (30,000 mi) in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the U.S. and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U.S. border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly 26,000 km (16,000 mi).\n\n\nThe first transcontinental railroad in the U.S. was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the Pacific coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system.[156] Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U.S. railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway had, by 1867, already accumulated more than 2,055 km (1,277 mi) of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nA shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories: the U.S. and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baseball is known as the national pastime of the United States, and is also played in Canada and many Latin American countries.\nThe cultures of North America are diverse. The U.S. and English Canada have many cultural similarities, while French Canada has a distinct culture from Anglophone Canada, which is protected by law. Since the U.S. was formed from portions previously part of the Spanish Empire and then independent Mexico, and there has been considerable and continuing immigration of Spanish speakers from south of the U.S.–Mexico border. In the southwest of the U.S. there are many Hispanic cultural traditions and considerable bilingualism. Mexico and Central America are part of Latin America and are culturally distinct from anglophone and francophone North America. However, they share with the United States the establishment of post-independence governments that are federated representative republics with written constitutions dating from their founding as nations. Canada is a federated parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy.\n\n\nCanada's constitution dates to 1867, with confederation, in the British North America Act, but not until 1982 did Canada have the power to amend its own constitution. Canada's Francophone heritage has been enshrined in law since the British parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774. In contrast to largely Protestant Anglo settlers in North America, French-speaking Canadians were Catholic and with the Quebec Act were guaranteed freedom to practice their religion, restored the right of the Catholic Church to impose tithes for its support, and established French civil law in most circumstances.\n\n\nThe distinctiveness of French language and culture has been codified in Canadian law, so that both English and French are designated official languages. The U.S. has no official language, but its national language is English.\n\n\nThe Canadian government took action to protect Canadian culture by limiting non-Canadian content in broadcasting, creating the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission to monitor Canadian content. In Quebec, the provincial government established the Quebec Office of the French Language, often called the \"language police\" by Anglophones, which mandates the use of French terminology and signage in French.[157] Since 1968 the unicameral legislature has been called the Quebec National Assembly. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, 24 June, is the national holiday of Quebec and celebrated by francophone Canadians throughout Canada. In Quebec, the school system was divided into Catholic and Protestant, so-called confessional schools. Anglophone education in Quebec has been increasingly undermined.[158]\n\n\nLatino culture is strong in the southwest of the U.S., as well as Florida, which draws Latin Americans from many countries in the hemisphere. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Mexicali, is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the U.S. Monterrey, a modern city with a significant industrial group, has been regarded as the most Americanized city in Mexico.[159] Northern Mexico, the Western U.S. and Alberta, Canada share a cowboy culture.\n\n\nThe Anglophone Caribbean states have witnessed and participated in the decline of the British Empire and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America in the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those remaining at home.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGreenland has experienced many immigration waves from Northern Canada, e.g. the Thule people. Therefore, Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous peoples of Canada. Greenland is also considered Nordic and has strong Danish ties due to centuries of colonization by Denmark.[160]\n\n\n\n### Popular culture – sports[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. and Canada have major sports teams that compete against each other, including baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer/football. Canada, Mexico and the U.S. will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe following table shows the most prominent sports leagues in North America, in order of average revenue.[161][162] Canada has a separate Canadian Football League from the U.S. teams.\n\n\nThe Native American game of lacrosse is considered a national sport in Canada. Curling is an important winter sport in Canada, and the Winter Olympics includes it in the roster. The English sport of cricket is popular in parts of anglophone Canada and very popular in parts of the former British empire, but in Canada is considered a minor sport. Boxing is also a major sport in some countries, such as Mexico, Panama and Puerto Rico, and it is considered one of the main individual sports in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n| League | Sport | Primarycountry | Founded | Teams | RevenueUS$ (bn) | Averageattendance\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Football League (NFL) | American football | United States | 1920 | 32 | $9.0 | 67,604 |\n| Major League Baseball (MLB) | Baseball | United StatesCanada | 1869 | 30 | $8.0 | 30,458 |\n| National Basketball Association (NBA) | Basketball | United StatesCanada | 1946 | 30 | $5.0 | 17,347 |\n| National Hockey League (NHL) | Ice hockey | United StatesCanada | 1917 | 32 | $3.3 | 17,720 |\n| Liga MX | Football (soccer) | Mexico | 1943 | 18 | $0.6 | 25,557 |\n| Major League Soccer (MLS) | Football (soccer) | United StatesCanada | 1994 | 28 | $0.5 | 21,574 |\n| Canadian Football League (CFL) | Canadian football | Canada | 1958 | 9 | $0.3 | 23,890 |\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Flags of North America\n* List of cities in North America\n* North American Union\n* Outline of North America\n* Table manners in North America\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** This North American density figure is based on a total land area of 23,090,542 km2 only, considerably less than the total combined land and water area of 24,709,000 km2.\n2. **^** Many Western countries view the Americas as a single continent, comprising North and South America.\n3. **^** The Aleutian Islands of Alaska extend into the Eastern Hemisphere.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Depending on the definition, Panama could be considered a transcontinental country while the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao) and Trinidad and Tobago could be considered either parts of North America or South America.\n5. **^** Since the Lucayan Archipelago is located in the Atlantic Ocean rather than Caribbean Sea, The Bahamas are part of the West Indies but are not technically part of the Caribbean, although the United Nations groups them with the Caribbean.\n6. **^** Panama is generally considered a North American country, though some authorities divide it at the Panama Canal.
