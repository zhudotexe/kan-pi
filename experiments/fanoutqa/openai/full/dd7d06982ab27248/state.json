He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901.\n\n\nBorn in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nPrudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper.[1]\n\n\nPrudhomme attended the Lyc\u00e9e Bonaparte, but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the Creusot region for the Schneider steel foundry, and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the *Conf\u00e9rence La Bruy\u00e8re* (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n\n\n\n## Writing[edit]\n\n\nHis first collection, *Stances et Po\u00e8mes* (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by Sainte-Beuve. It included his most famous poem, *Le vase bris\u00e9*. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. This war, which he discussed in *Impressions de la guerre* (1872) and *La France* (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n\n\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the Parnassus school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly Lucretius's *De rerum natura*, whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in *La Justice* (1878) and *Le Bonheur* (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1881. Another distinction, *Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur*, was to follow in 1895.\n\n\nAfter *Le Bonheur*, Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on aesthetics and philosophy. He published two important essays: *L'Expression dans les beaux-arts* (1884) and *R\u00e9flexions sur l'art des vers* (1892), a series of articles on Blaise Pascal in *La Revue des Deux Mondes* (1890), and an article on free will (*La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre*, 1906) in the *Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale*.\n\n\n\n## Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1901 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe first writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres*. He also founded, in 1902, the *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ais* with Jose-Maria de Heredia and Leon Dierx.\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grave of Sully Prudhomme at P\u00e8re-Lachaise in Paris.\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a recluse at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise in Paris.\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Poetry[edit]\n\n\n* 1865: *Stances et po\u00e8mes*\n* 1866: *Les \u00e9preuves*\n* 1868: *Croquis italiens*\n* 1869: *Les solitudes: po\u00e9sies* [*Les \u00e9curies d\u2019Augias*]\n* 1872: *Les destins*\n* 1874: *La r\u00e9volte des fleurs*\n* 1874: *La France*\n* 1875: *Les vaines tendresses*\n* 1876: *Le z\u00e9nith*, previously published in *Revue des deux mondes*\n* 1878: *La justice*\n* 1865\u20131888: *Po\u00e9sie*\n* 1886: *Le prisme, po\u00e9sies diverses*\n* 1888: *Le bonheur*\n* 1908: *\u00c9paves*\n\n\n### Prose[edit]\n\n\n* 1883\u20131908: *\u0152uvres de Sully Prudhomme* (poetry and prose), 8 volumes, A.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 119 individuals.[6] The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\nSeventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second highest number of any of the Nobel Prizes behind the Nobel Peace Prize.[11][12] There have been four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940\u20131943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates. France has the highest number of Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n|

His work regarding Roman history is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Literature for being \"the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, *A History of Rome*\", after having been nominated by 18 members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.[2][3] He was also a prominent German politician, as a member of the Prussian and German parliaments. His works on Roman law and on the law of obligations had a significant impact on the German civil code.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nMommsen was born to German parents in Garding in the Duchy of Schleswig in 1817, then ruled by the king of Denmark, and grew up in Bad Oldesloe in Holstein, where his father was a Lutheran minister. He studied mostly at home, though he attended the Gymnasium Christianeum in Altona for four years. He studied Greek and Latin and received his diploma in 1837. As he could not afford to study at G\u00f6ttingen, he enrolled at the University of Kiel.\n\n\nMommsen studied jurisprudence at Kiel from 1838 to 1843, finishing his studies with the degree of Doctor of Roman Law. During this time he was the roommate of Theodor Storm, who was later to become a renowned poet. Together with Mommsen's brother Tycho, the three friends even published a collection of poems (*Liederbuch dreier Freunde*). Thanks to a royal Danish grant, Mommsen was able to visit France and Italy to study preserved classical Roman inscriptions. During the revolution of 1848 he worked as a war correspondent in then-Danish Rendsburg, supporting the German annexation of Schleswig-Holstein and a constitutional reform. Having been forced to leave the country by the Danes, he became a professor of law in the same year at the University of Leipzig. When Mommsen protested against the new constitution of Saxony in 1851, he had to resign. However, the next year he obtained a professorship in Roman law at the University of Zurich and then spent a couple of years in exile. In 1854 he became a professor of law at the University of Breslau where he met Jakob Bernays. Mommsen became a research professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1857. He later helped to create and manage the German Archaeological Institute in Rome.\n\n\nIn 1858 Mommsen was appointed a member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, and he also became professor of Roman History at the University of Berlin in 1861, where he held lectures up to 1887. Mommsen received high recognition for his academic achievements: foreign membership of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1859,[4] the Prussian medal Pour le M\u00e9rite in 1868, honorary citizenship of Rome, elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1870,[5] and the Nobel prize in literature in 1902 for his main work *R\u00f6mische Geschichte* (*Roman History*). (He is one of the very few non-fiction writers to receive the Nobel Prize in literature.)[6]\n\n\nIn 1873, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.[7]\n\n\nAt 2 a.m. on 7 July 1880 a fire occurred in the upper floor workroom-library of Mommsen's house at Marchstra\u00dfe 6 in Berlin.[8][9][10] After being burned while attempting to remove valuable papers, he was restrained from returning to the blazing house. Several old manuscripts were burnt to ashes, including *Manuscript 0.4.36*, which was on loan from the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.[11] There is information that the important Manuscript of Jordanes from Heidelberg University library was burnt.[12] Two other important manuscripts, from Brussels and Halle, were also destroyed.[13]\n\n\nMommsen was an indefatigable worker who rose at five to do research in his library. People often saw him reading whilst walking in the streets.[14]\n\n\nMommsen had sixteen children with his wife Marie (daughter of the publisher and editor Karl Reimer of Leipzig). Their oldest daughter Maria married Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, the great Classics scholar. Their grandson Theodor Ernst Mommsen (1905\u20131958) became a professor of medieval history in the United States. Two of the great-grandsons, Hans Mommsen and Wolfgang Mommsen, were German historians.\n\n\n\n## Mommsen as editor and organiser[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Theodor Mommsen in 1881\nWhile he was secretary of the Historical-Philological Class at the Berlin Academy (1874\u20131895), Mommsen organised countless scientific projects, mostly editions of original sources.\n\n\n\n### *Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum*[edit]\n\n\nAt the beginning of his career, when he published the inscriptions of the Neapolitan Kingdom (1852), Mommsen already had in mind a collection of all known ancient Latin inscriptions. He received additional impetus and training from Bartolomeo Borghesi of San Marino. The complete *Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum* would consist of seventeen volumes, the latest of which was published in 1986. Fifteen of these volumes were published still in Mommsen's lifetime and he wrote five of them himself. The basic principle of the edition (contrary to previous collections) was the method of autopsy, according to which all copies (i.e., modern transcriptions) of inscriptions were to be checked and compared to the original.\n\n\n\n### Further editions and research projects[edit]\n\n\nMommsen published the fundamental collections in Roman law: the *Corpus Iuris Civilis* and the *Codex Theodosianus*. Furthermore, he played an important role in the publication of the *Monumenta Germaniae Historica*, the edition of the texts of the Church Fathers, the limes romanus (Roman frontiers) research and countless other projects.\n\n\n\n## Mommsen as politician[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Radicalism |\n| History\n* Age of Enlightenment\n* Atlantic Revolutions\n\t+ American

House of Representatives from 1863 to 1866 and again from 1873 to 1879, and delegate to the Reichstag from 1881 to 1884, at first for the liberal German Progress Party (*Deutsche Fortschrittspartei*), later for the National Liberal Party, and finally for the Secessionists. He was very concerned with questions about academic and educational policies and held national positions. Although he had supported German Unification, he was disappointed with the politics of the German Empire and he was quite pessimistic about its future. Mommsen strongly disagreed with Otto von Bismarck about social policies in 1881, advising collaboration between Liberals and Social Democrats and using such strong language that he narrowly avoided prosecution.\n\n\nAs a Liberal nationalist Mommsen favored assimilation of ethnic minorities into German society, not exclusion.[15] In 1879, his colleague Heinrich von Treitschke began a political campaign against Jews (the so-called *Berliner Antisemitismusstreit*). Mommsen strongly opposed antisemitism and wrote a harsh pamphlet in which he denounced von Treitschke's views. Mommsen viewed a solution to antisemitism in voluntary cultural assimilation, suggesting that the Jews could follow the example of the people of Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover and other German states, which gave up some of their special customs when integrating into Prussia.[16]\nMommsen was a vehement spokesman for German nationalism, maintaining a militant attitude towards the Slavic nations, to the point of advocating the use of violence against them. In an 1897 letter to the *Neue Freie Presse* of Vienna, Mommsen called Czechs \"apostles of barbarism\" and wrote that \"the Czech skull is impervious to reason, but it is susceptible to blows\".[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Influence of Mommsen[edit]\n\n\nFellow Nobel Laureate (1925) Bernard Shaw cited Mommsen's interpretation of the last First Consul of the Republic, Julius Caesar, as one of the inspirations for his 1898 (1905 on Broadway) play, *Caesar and Cleopatra*.\n\n\nNoted naval historian and theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan formulated the thesis for his magnum opus, *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History*, while reading Mommsen's *History of Rome*.[19]\n\n\nThe playwright Heiner M\u00fcller wrote a 'performance text' entitled *Mommsens Block* (1993), inspired by the publication of Mommsen's fragmentary notes on the later Roman empire and by the East German government's decision to replace a statue of Karl Marx outside the Humboldt University of Berlin with one of Mommsen.[20]\n\n\nThere is a Gymnasium (academic high school) named for Mommsen in his hometown of Bad Oldesloe, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. His birthplace Garding in the west of Schleswig styles itself \"Mommsen-Stadt Garding\".\n\n\n\n### Mark Twain[edit]\n\n\n\"One of the highpoints of Mark Twain's European tour of 1892 was a large formal banquet at the University of Berlin... . Mark Twain was an honoured guest, seated at the head table with some twenty 'particularly eminent professors'; and it was from this vantage point that he witnessed the following incident...\"[21] In Twain's own words: \n\n\n\n\n> When apparently the last eminent guest had long ago taken his place, again those three bugle-blasts rang out, and once more the swords leaped from their scabbards. Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance, and we saw the silken gleam and the lifted sword of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. There was an excited whisper at our table\u2014'MOMMSEN!'\u2014and the whole house rose. Rose and shouted and stamped and clapped and banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm!\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> Then the little man with his long hair and Emersonian face edged his way past us and took his seat. I could have touched him with my hand\u2014Mommsen!\u2014think of it! ... I would have walked a great many miles to get a sight of him, and here he was, without trouble or tramp or cost of any kind. Here he was clothed in a titanic deceptive modesty which made him look like other men.[22]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nMommsen published over 1,500 works, and effectively established a new framework for the systematic study of Roman history. He pioneered epigraphy, the study of inscriptions in material artefacts. Although the unfinished *History of Rome*, written early in his career, has long been widely considered as his main work, the work most relevant today is, perhaps, the *Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum*, a collection of Roman inscriptions he contributed to the Berlin Academy.[23]\n\n\n\n* Mommsen, Theodor. *Rome, from earliest times to 44 B.

I was also astonished at the high standard of industry both among the Seniors and the Juniors whom I mixed up with. And I could not help feeling that our steadiest workers among my Oxford undergraduate friends were only casual 'half-timers' by comparison. What was still more stimulating was the whole-hearted and unquestioning reverence for learning broadcast through the academic circles and extending even to the outside public. I had a striking proof of this: as an illustration of national character, the anecdote is worth recording. Living in Berlin at some distance from the university, I used to go in every morning by the same early tram: and at last noting that I was a foreigner of regular habits, the affable and chatty tramway conductor used to point out to me the objects worthy of interest by the way (*Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten*\u2014a crisp Teutonic word). One morning as we approached a halting-place, I saw a little old gentleman with silvery hair leaning against a lamp-post and holding a large open volume near to his short-sighted eyes, oblivious of the uproar around: the conductor sprang down towards him, and tapping him reverentially on the shoulder conducted him gently to the tram and settled him in his place. Immediately the old gentleman buried himself again up to the eyes in his tome. The conductor, proud of this new *Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeit*, whispered to me in an awed voice:  *'Da ist der ber\u00fchmte Herr Professor Mommsen; er verliert kein Moment'!* ('There is the famous Professor Mr Mommsen; he never loses a moment!' referring to his absorption in his book). I felt thrilled, not by Mommsen, but by this deep revelation of the national soul, an illiterate conductor knowing of Mommsen at all, knowing that he was academically famous, being proud of having him in his tram, and proud that he 'never lost a moment' for study.\" \u2014 Farnell, Lewis R.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 119 individuals.[6] The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\nSeventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second highest number of any of the Nobel Prizes behind the Nobel Peace Prize.[11][12] There have been four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940\u20131943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates. France has the highest number of Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n|

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 119 individuals.[6] The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\nSeventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second highest number of any of the Nobel Prizes behind the Nobel Peace Prize.[11][12] There have been four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940\u20131943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year.

He received the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Proven\u00e7al philologist\". Mistral was a founding member of the F\u00e9librige and member of the Acad\u00e9mie de Marseille.\n\n\nHis name in his native language was Frederi Mistral (Mistrau) according to the Mistralian orthography or Frederic Mistral (or Mistrau) according to the classical orthography.\n\n\nMistral's fame was owing in part to Alphonse de Lamartine who sang his praises in the 40th edition of his periodical *Cours familier de litt\u00e9rature*, following the publication of Mistral's long poem *Mir\u00e8io*. Alphonse Daudet, with whom he maintained a long friendship, eulogized him in \"Poet Mistral\", one of the stories in his collection *Letters from My Windmill* (*Lettres de mon moulin*).\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral in Arles\nMistral was born in Maillane in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne department in Southern France.[1] His parents were wealthy landed farmers.[1] His father, Fran\u00e7ois Mistral, was from Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence.[1] His mother was Adelaide Poulinet. As early as 1471, his paternal ancestor, Mermet Mistral, lived in Maillane.[1] By 1588, the Mistral family lived in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence.[1]\n\n\nMistral was given the Proven\u00e7al name \"Frederi\" in memory \"of a poor small fellow who, at the time when my parents were courting, sweetly ran their errands of love, and who died shortly afterward of sunstroke.\"[2] Mistral did not begin school until he was about nine years old, and quickly began to play truant, leading his parents to send him to a boarding school in Saint-Michel-de-Frigolet, run by a Monsieur Donnat.\n\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's degree in N\u00eemes, Mistral studied law in Aix-en-Provence from 1848 to 1851. He became a champion for the independence of Provence, and in particular for restoring the \"first literary language of civilized Europe\"\u2014Proven\u00e7al. He had studied the history of Provence during his time in Aix-en-Provence. Emancipated by his father, Mistral resolved: \"to raise, revive in Provence the feeling of race ...; to move this rebirth by the restoration of the natural and historical language of the country ...; to restore the fashion to Provence by the breath and flame of divine poetry\". For Mistral, the word race designates \"people linked by language, rooted in a country and in a story\".\n\n\nFor his lifelong efforts in restoring the language of Provence, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral was one of the recipients of the 1904 Nobel Prize for Literature after having been nominated by two professors from the Swedish Uppsala University.[3][4] The other winner that year, Jos\u00e9 Echegaray, was honored for his Spanish dramas. They shared the prize money equally.[5] Mistral devoted his half to the creation of the Museum at Arles, known locally as \"Museon Arlaten\". The museum is considered to be the most important collection of Proven\u00e7al folk art, displaying furniture, costumes, ceramics, tools and farming implements. In addition, Mistral was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. This was a most unusual occurrence since it is usually only awarded for notable achievement on a national level, whereas Mistral was uniquely Proven\u00e7al in his work and achievement.\n\n\nIn 1876, Mistral married a Burgundian woman, Marie-Louise Rivi\u00e8re (1857\u20131943) in Dijon Cathedral *(Cath\u00e9drale Saint-B\u00e9nigne de Dijon)*. They had no children. Mistral died on 25 March 1914 in Maillane, the same village where he was born.\n\n\n\n## F\u00e9librige[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque on the *rue* Louis Pasteur in Avignon where Joseph Roumanille taught such brilliant future poets as Anselme Matthieu and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral\nMistral joined forces with one of his teachers, Joseph Roumanille, and five other Proven\u00e7al poets and on 21 May 1854, they founded F\u00e9librige, a literary and cultural association, which made it possible to promote the Occitan language. Placed under the patronage of Saint Estelle, the movement also welcomed Catalan poets from Spain, driven out by Isabelle II.\n\n\nThe seven founders of the organization were (to use their Proven\u00e7al names): J\u00f3us\u00e8 Roumaniho, Frederi Mistral, Teodor Aubanel, Ans\u00e8ume Mati\u00e9u, Jan Brunet, Anfos Tavan and Paul Giera. F\u00e9librige exists to this day, one of the few remaining cultural organizations in 32 departments of the \"Langue d'Oc\".\n\n\nMistral strove to rehabilitate the language of Provence, while carrying it to the highest summits of epic poetry. He redefined the language in its purest form by creating a dictionary and transcribing the songs of the troubadours, who spoke the language in its original form.\n\n\n\n## Lexicography: *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u Felibrige*[edit]\n\n\nMistral is the author of *Lou Tresor d\u00f3u F\u00e9librige* (1878\u20131886), which to date remains the most comprehensive dictionary of the Occitan language, and one of the most reliable, thanks to the precision of its definitions. It is a bilingual dictionary, Occitan-French, in two large volumes, with all of the dialects of *oc*, including Proven\u00e7al. Mistral owes to Fran\u00e7ois Vidal the work of typesetting and revising that dictionary.\n\n\n\n## *Mir\u00e8io* \u2013 *Mireille*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mistral during his career.\nMistral's most important work is *Mir\u00e8io* (*Mireille*), published in 1859, after eight years of effort. *Mir\u00e8io*, a long poem in Proven\u00e7al consisting of twelve songs, tells of the thwarted love of Vincent and Mireille, two young Proven\u00e7al people of different social backgrounds. The name Mireille (Mir\u00e8io in Provence) is a doublet of the word *meraviho* which means wonder.\n\n\nMistral used the occasion not only to promote his language but also to share the culture of an area. Among other tales, he tells of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, where according to legend the dragon Tarasque was driven out, and of the famous and ancient Venus of Arles. He prefaced the poem with a short notice about Proven\u00e7al pronunciation.\n\n\nThe poem tells how Mireille's parents wish her to marry a Proven\u00e7al landowner, but she falls in love with a poor basket maker named Vincent, who loves her as well. After rejecting three rich suitors, a desperate Mireille, driven by the refusal of her parents to let her marry Vincent, runs off to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to pray to the patrons of Provence to change her parents' minds. Having forgotten to bring a hat, she falls victim to the heat, dying in Vincent's arms under the gaze of her parents.\n\n\nMistral dedicated his book to Alphonse de Lamartine as follows:\n\n\n\"To Lamartine:\n\n\nTo you, I dedicate Mireille:\nIt is my heart and my soul;\nIt is the flower of my years;\nIt is bunch of grapes from La Crau, leaves and all, a peasant's offering.\"\n\n\nLamartine wrote enthusiastically: \"I will tell you good news today! A great epic poet is born ... A true Homeric poet in our time; ... Yes, your epic poem is a masterpiece; ... the perfume of your book will not evaporate in a thousand years.\"\n\n\n*Mir\u00e8io* was translated into some fifteen European languages, including into French by Mistral himself. In 1863, Charles Gounod made it into an opera, *Mireille*.\n\n\n\n## Quotations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Relief of Mistral by Jean Barnab\u00e9 Amy\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Swedish Academy.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4] In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 8,823,637.78 SEK in January 2018. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to 119 individuals.[6] The youngest laureate was Rudyard Kipling, who was 41 years old when he was awarded in 1907. The oldest laureate to receive the prize was Doris Lessing, who was 88 when she was awarded in 2007. It has been awarded posthumously once, to Erik Axel Karlfeldt in 1931.[7] When he received the award in 1958, Russian-born Boris Pasternak was forced to publicly reject the award under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre made known that he did not wish to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature,[8] as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past.[9] However the Nobel committee does not acknowledge refusals, and includes Pasternak and Sartre in its list of Nobel laureates.[10]\n\n\nSeventeen women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the second highest number of any of the Nobel Prizes behind the Nobel Peace Prize.[11][12] There have been four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940\u20131943). There have been three years for which the Nobel Prize in Literature was delayed one year: the prizes for 1915,[13] 1949[14] and 2018[15][16][6] were each awarded together with that of the following year in October of the following year. As of 2022, there have been 29 English-speaking laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, followed by French with 16 laureates and German with 14 laureates. France has the highest number of Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n|

He was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHe was born in Madrid on 19 April 1832.[2] His father, a doctor and institute professor of Greek,[3] was from Aragon and his mother was from Navarra. He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read Goethe, Homer, and Balzac, readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like Gauss, Legendre, and Lagrange.\n\n\nIn order to earn enough money to attend the *Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda de Caminos, Canales y Puertos* (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid.[4] At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.[5]\n\n\n\n## Professor and scientist[edit]\n\n\nIn 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, stereotomy, hydraulics, descriptive geometry, and differential and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants' School of Public Works.\n\n\nHis *Problemas de geometr\u00eda anal\u00edtica* (1865) and *Teor\u00edas modernas de la f\u00edsica. Unidad de las fuerzas materiales* (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine *La Revista*, and took a prominent part in propagating free trade doctrines in the press and on the platform.[5]\n\n\nHe was clearly marked out for office, and when the revolution of 1868 overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.[5]\n\n\n\n## Government service[edit]\n\n\nEchegaray also entered politics later in his life. As a founding member of the republican Radical Democratic Party,[6] he enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874.[3] He retired from politics after the Bourbon restoration in 1874.[5]\n\n\n\n## Literary career[edit]\n\n\nTheater had always been the love of Jos\u00e9 Echegaray's life. Although he had written earlier plays (*La Hija natural* and *La \u00daltima Noche*, both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874.[5] His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, remaining a prolific playwright.\n\n\nHis most famous play is *El gran Galeoto*, a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to *The World and His Wife*, and it was the basis for a later film The Great Galeoto. His most remarkable plays[*citation needed*] are *O locura o santidad* (Saint or Madman?, 1877); *Mariana* (1892); *El estigma* (1895); *La duda*, 1898; and *El loco Dios* (God, the fool, 1900).\n\n\nAmong his other famous plays are *La esposa del vengador* (1874) (The Avenger's Wife); *En el pu\u00f1o de la espada* (1875) (In the Sword's Handle); *En el pilar y en la cruz* (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and *Conflicto entre dos deberes* (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).[3]\n\n\nAlong with the Proven\u00e7al poet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jos\u00e9 Echegaray\nJos\u00e9 Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid.[2] His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes. At the age of 83 he commented: \n\n\n> I cannot die, because if I am going to write my mathematical physics encyclopedia, I need at least 25 more years.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\nSeveral streets in Spain are named after Jos\u00e9 Echegaray. *Calle Echegaray* in Madrid's *Barrio de las Letras* is especially noteworthy.[8][9] In 1971 the Bank of Spain issued a 1000-peseta banknote in his honor.[10]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Burell was elected for the position in 1916 but never took the seat\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Jos\u00e9 Echegaray y Eizaguirre - Spanish dramatist\". *Britannica.com*.
