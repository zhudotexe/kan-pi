The website was set up as a type of \"hot or not\" game for Harvard students. The website allowed visitors to compare two students' pictures side by side and let them decide who was more attractive.[9]\n\n\nWhile writing the software, Mark Zuckerberg wrote the following blog entries:[10]\n\n\n\n\n> I'm a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it's not even 10 p.m. and it's a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland [dorm] facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive.[10]\n> \n> \u2014\u200a9:48\u00a0pm[11]\n> \n\n\n\n> Yea, it's on. I'm not exactly sure how the farm animals are going to fit into this whole thing (you can't really ever be sure with farm animals\u00a0...), but I like the idea of comparing two people together.\n> \n> \u2014\u200a11:09\u00a0pm[10]\n> \n\n\nAccording to *The Harvard Crimson*, Facemash used \"photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the \"hotter\" person\".[9] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.[12]\n\n\nThe site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individuals' privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[9] Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an art history final exam. He uploaded art images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section, then shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.[13]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2010, entrepreneur and banker Rahul Jain auctioned off the FaceMash.com domain to an unknown buyer for $30,201.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## TheFacebook[edit]\n\n\nA \"face book\" is a student directory featuring photos and basic information.[12] In 2003, there were no universal online facebooks at Harvard, with only paper sheets distributed[16] and private online directories.[9][17] Zuckerberg told the *Crimson* that \"Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard.\u00a0... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.\"[17] In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website, known as \"TheFacebook\", with the inspiration coming from an editorial in the *Crimson* about Facemash, stating that \"It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available\u00a0... the benefits are many.\" Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 in the site.[10] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched it under the name of \"TheFacebook\", originally located at thefacebook.com.[18]\n\n\nZuckerberg intended to create a website that could connect people around the university. Upon finishing the site, Zuckerberg told a couple of friends, one of whom suggested sharing it on the Kirkland House online mailing list, which included several hundred people. According to his roommate, Dustin Moskovitz, \"By the end of the night, we were\u00a0... actively watching the registration process. Within twenty-four hours, we had somewhere between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred registrants.\"[19]\n\n\nJust six days after the launch of the site, three Harvard University seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, but instead using their idea to build a competing product.[20] The three complained to the *Crimson*, and the newspaper began an investigation. Zuckerberg knew about the investigation so he used TheFacebook.com to find members in the site who identified themselves as members of the *Crimson*. He examined a history of failed logins to see if any of the *Crimson* members had ever entered an incorrect password into TheFacebook.com. In the cases in which they had failed to log in, Zuckerberg tried to use them to access the *Crimson* members' Harvard email accounts, and he was successful in accessing two of them. In the end, three *Crimson* members filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg which was later settled.[20][21]\n\n\nMembership was initially restricted to students of Harvard University. Within the first month, more than half the undergraduate population at Harvard was registered on the service.[22] Zuckerberg was joined in the promotion of the site by Saverin (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), Andrew McCollum (graphic artist), and Chris Hughes. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Stanford, Columbia, and Yale.[3] This expansion continued when it opened to all Ivy League and Boston-area schools. It gradually reached most universities in the United States and Canada.[23][24][25] Facebook was incorporated in the summer of 2004, and the entrepreneur Sean Parker, who had been informally advising Zuckerberg, became the company's president.[26] In June 2004, Facebook moved its base of operations to Palo Alto, California.[3]\n\n\n\n## Facebook[edit]\n\n\nThe company dropped 'The' from its name after purchasing the domain name *facebook.com* in 2005 for $200,000.[27] The following year, the platform was made available for high school students, and in 2006, it became accessible to the general public.\n\n\nIn December 2005, it was reported that Facebook had 6 million monthly active users.[28]\nIn April 2023, Facebook had 2.989 billion monthly active users.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal active users[N 1]| Date | Users(in millions) | \u00b1% p.m. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  2004-02-04  | 0 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  2004-04-04  | 0.07[29] | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  2004-07-04  | 0.1[30] | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  2004-10-04  | 1.5[31] | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  2008-08-26  | 100[32] | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n|  2009-04-08  | 200[33] | +9.83% |\n|  2009-09-15  | 300[34] | +8.02% |\n|  2010-01-05  | 400[35] | +8.13% |\n|  2010-07-21  | 500[36] | +3.51% |\n|  2011-01-05  | 600[37][N 2] | +3.36% |\n|  2011-05-30  | 700[38] | +3.29% |\n|  2011-09-22  | 800[39] | +3.60% |\n|  2012-04-24  | 900[40] | +1.68% |\n|  2012-09-14  | 1,000[41] | +2.27% |\n|  2013-03-31  | 1,110[42] | +1.62% |\n|  2013-12-31  | 1,230[43] | +1.14% |\n|  2014-12-31  | 1,390[44] | +1.02% |\n|  2015-12-31  | 1,590[45] | +1.13% |\n|  2016-12-31  | 1,860[46] | +1.31% |\n\n\nOn October 1, 2005, Facebook expanded to twenty-one universities in the United Kingdom and others around the world. Facebook launched a high school version in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step.[47] At that time, high school networks required an invitation to join.[48] Facebook later expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.[49] On December 11, 2005, universities in Australia and New Zealand were added to the Facebook network, bringing its size to 2,000+ colleges and 25,000+ high schools throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. Facebook was then opened on September 26, 2006, to everyone aged 13 and older with a valid email address.[7][8]\n\n\nLate in 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages, allowing companies to attract potential customers and tell about themselves. These started as group pages, but a new concept called company pages was planned.[50]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.[51]\n\n\nIn 2010, Facebook began to invite users to become beta testers after passing a question-and-answer-based selection process,[52] and a set of Facebook Engineering Puzzles where users would solve computational problems which gave them an opportunity to be hired by Facebook.[53]\n\n\nAs of February 2011, Facebook had become the largest online photo host, being cited by Facebook application and online photo aggregator Pixable as expecting to have 100 billion photos by summer 2011.[54] As of October 2011, over 350 million users accessed Facebook through their mobile phones, accounting for 33% of all Facebook traffic.[55]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2012, Yahoo! filed suit in a U.S. federal court against Facebook weeks before the scheduled Facebook initial public offering. In its court filing, Yahoo! said that Facebook had infringed on ten of its patents covering advertising, privacy controls and social networking. Yahoo! had threatened to sue Facebook a month before the filing, insisting that the social network license its patents. A spokesperson for Facebook issued a statement saying \"We're disappointed that Yahoo, a long-time business partner of Facebook and a company that has substantially benefited from its association with Facebook, has decided to resort to litigation\".[56] The lawsuit claims that Yahoo!'s patents cover basic social networking ideas such as customizing website users' experiences to their needs, adding that the patents cover ways of targeting ads to individual users.[57] In 2012, Facebook App Center, an online mobile store, was rolled out. The store initially had 500 Facebook apps which were mostly games.[58]\n\n\nOn April 24, 2014, Facebook and Storyful announced a new feature called FB Newswire.[59]\n\n\nIn addition to the Android and iOS mobile app, Facebook developed another Android and iOS app called Facebook Lite[60] which uses less data. Another project from Facebook is called Facebook Zero, which allows users to use a mobile text-only version of Facebook for free, without paying for mobile data when using some mobile network operators.\n\n\nIn May 2018, the company announced their own dating service, called Facebook Dating.\n\n\n\n## Financials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance to Facebook headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California\n![](image)Facebook's former headquarters in downtown Palo Alto, California\n### Initial funding[edit]\n\n\nFacebook was initially incorporated as a Florida LLC. For the first few months after its launch in February 2004, the costs for the website operations for thefacebook.com were paid for by Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, who had taken equity stakes in the company. The website also ran a few advertisements to meet its operating costs.[61]\n\n\n\n### First angel investment[edit]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2004, venture capitalist Peter Thiel made a $500,001 angel investment in the social network Facebook for 10.2% of the company and joined Facebook's board. This was the first outside investment in Facebook.[62][63][64]\n\n\nIn his book *The Facebook Effect*, David Kirkpatrick outlines the story of how Thiel came to make his investment: former Napster and Plaxo employee Sean Parker, who at the time had assumed the title of \"President\" of Facebook, was seeking investors for Facebook. Parker approached Reid Hoffman, the CEO of work-based social network LinkedIn. Hoffman liked Facebook but declined to be the lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest with his duties as LinkedIn CEO. He redirected Parker to Peter Thiel, whom he knew from their PayPal days (both Hoffman and Thiel are considered members of the PayPal Mafia). Thiel met Parker and Mark Zuckerberg, the Harvard college student who had founded Facebook and controlled it. Thiel and Zuckerberg got along well and Thiel agreed to lead Facebook's seed round with $500,000 for 10.2% of the company. Hoffman and Mark Pincus also participated in the round, along with Maurice Werdegar who led the investment on behalf of Western Technology Investment. The investment was originally in the form of a convertible note, to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. Although Facebook narrowly missed the target, Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway.[65] Thiel said of his investment:\n\n\n\n\n> I was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. And it was a very reasonable valuation. I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment.[65]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Accel investment (Series A)[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2005, Accel Partners agreed to make a $12.7\u00a0million venture capital investment in a deal that valued Facebook at $98 million. Accel joined Facebook's board, and the board was expanded to five seats, with Zuckerberg, Thiel, and Accel's Jim Breyer in three of the seats, and the other two seats currently being empty but with Zuckerberg free to nominate anybody to those seats.[66]\n\n\n\n### Greylock investment (Series B)[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2006, Facebook closed its Series B funding round. This included $27.5\u00a0million from a number of venture capitalists, including Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital, plus additional investments from Peter Thiel and Accel Partners. The valuation for this round was about $500 million.[64][67][68]\n\n\nA leaked cash flow statement showed that during the 2005 fiscal year, Facebook had a net gain of $5.66\u00a0million.[69]\n\n\n\n### Sales negotiations[edit]\n\n\nWith the sale of social networking website MySpace to News Corp on July 19, 2005, rumours surfaced about the possible sale of Facebook to a larger media company.[70] Zuckerberg had already stated that he did not want to sell the company, and denied rumors to the contrary.[71] On March 28, 2006, *BusinessWeek* reported that a potential acquisition of Facebook was under negotiation. Facebook reportedly declined an offer of $750\u00a0million from an unknown bidder, and it was rumored the asking price rose as high as $2\u00a0billion.[72]\n\n\nIn September 2006, serious talks between Facebook and Yahoo! took place concerning acquisition of Facebook, with prices reaching as high as $1\u00a0billion.[73][74] Thiel, by then a board member of Facebook, indicated that Facebook's internal valuation was around $8\u00a0billion based on their projected revenues of $1\u00a0billion by 2015, comparable to Viacom's MTV brand, a company with a shared target demographic audience.[75]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2007, Zuckerberg said that selling Facebook was unlikely because he wanted to keep it independent, saying \"We're not really looking to sell the company\u00a0... We're not looking to IPO anytime soon. It's just not the core focus of the company.\"[76] In September 2007, Microsoft approached Facebook, proposing an investment in return for a 5% stake in the company, offering an estimated $300\u2013500\u00a0million.[77] That month, other companies, including Google, expressed interest in buying a portion of Facebook.[78]\n\n\n\n### Microsoft investment (Series C)[edit]\n\n\nOn October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240\u00a0million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15\u00a0billion.[79] However, Microsoft bought preferred stock that carried special rights, such as \"liquidation preferences\" that meant Microsoft would get paid before common stockholders if the company were sold. Microsoft's purchase also included the right to place international ads on Facebook.[80] In November 2007, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing invested $60\u00a0million in Facebook.[81]\n\n\n\n### DST investment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Yuri Milner's DST (which later split into DST Global and Mail.ru Group), alongside Uzbek Russian metals magnate Alisher Usmanov, invested $200 million in Facebook when it was valued at $10 billion.[82][83][84] A separate stake was also acquired by Usmanov's USM Holdings on another occasion.[85][82] According to the New York Times in 2013, \"Mr. Usmanov and other Russian investors at one point owned nearly 10 percent of Facebook, though precise details of their ownership stakes are difficult to assess.\"[85] It was later revealed in 2017 by the Paradise Papers that lending by Russian state-backed VTB Bank and Gazprom's investment vehicle partially financed these 2009 investments, although Milner was reportedly unaware at the time.[86][87]\n\n![](image)Entrance to Facebook's former headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California. In January 2012 the company moved to a new campus in Menlo Park, California.\n### Switch to profitability[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, *BusinessWeek* reported that private sales by employees, as well as purchases by venture capital firms, were being done at share prices that put the company's total valuation at between $3.75\u00a0billion and $5\u00a0billion.[80] In October 2008, Zuckerberg said \"I don't think social networks can be monetized in the same way that search did\u00a0... In three years from now we have to figure out what the optimum model is. But that is not our primary focus today.\"[88]\n\n\nFacebook hired Sheryl Sandberg as its Chief Operating Officer in March 2008. Sandberg is reported to have held a number of brainstorming sessions with Facebook employees on their long-term monetization strategy, which led to the conclusion that advertising would be the main source of monetization. Under Sandberg's leadership, Facebook made a number of changes to its advertising model with the aim of achieving profitability. In September 2009, Facebook stated that it had turned cash flow positive for the first time.[89]\n\n\nIn early 2012, Facebook disclosed that its profits had jumped 65% to $1 billion in the previous year when its revenue, which is mainly from advertising, had jumped almost 90% to $3.71 billion.[90] Facebook also reported that 56% of its advertising revenue comes from the United States alone, and that 12% of its revenue comes from Zynga, the social network game development company. Payments and other fees were $557 million up from $106 million the previous year.[91]\n\n\n\n\n### Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2009, Facebook acquired social media real-time news aggregator FriendFeed,[92] a startup created by Gmail's first engineer Paul Buchheit.[93][94][95]\n\n\nIn February 2010, Facebook acquired Malaysian contact-importing startup Octazen Solutions.[96] On April 2, 2010, Facebook announced acquisition of a photo-sharing service called Divvyshot for an undisclosed amount.[97] In June 2010, an online marketplace for trading private Facebook stock reflected a valuation of $11.5\u00a0billion.[98]\n\n\nOn April 12, 2012, Facebook acquired photo sharing service Instagram for approximately $1\u00a0billion in cash and stock.[99][100]\n\n\nOn March 8, 2013, Facebook announced that they acquired the team from Storylane, but not the product itself.[101] On October 13, 2013, Facebook acquired Onavo, an Israeli analytics company, for approximately $120 million.[102][103][104]\n\n\nOn February 19, 2014, Facebook announced its acquisition of WhatsApp, a smartphone instant messaging application for $19 billion in a mix of stock and cash. The acquisition is the most ever paid for a venture-capital backed startup.[105]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2014, Facebook announced they had acquired virtual reality startup Oculus VR for $2 billion in cash and stock.[106]\n\n\n\n## Initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Initial public offering of Facebook\n\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on February 1, 2012.[107] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company was seeking to raise $5 billion. The document announced that the company had 845 million active monthly users and its website featured 2.7 billion daily likes and comments.[108] After the IPO, Zuckerberg retains a 22% ownership share in Facebook and owns 57% of the voting shares.[109]\n\n\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, pricing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.[110] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced that it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[111] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third largest in U.S. history (just ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa Inc.).[112][113] The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations \u2013 surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon.com, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods \u2013 and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[112][113] *The New York Times* stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[112] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That's a big multiple to live up to, and [Facebook] will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation\".[114]\n\n\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the NASDAQ exchange.[115] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[116] At closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[117] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[118]\nThe stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[119] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[120]\n\n\nOn 22 May, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients, rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[121] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[122] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[123]\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n\"Facebook timeline\" redirects here.

The changes are along the same lines as those announced in the planned revamp announced March 7, 2013 (that was halted), but are more minor and focused.[237][238][239] |\n| 2014 | March 17 | Product | Facebook's face recognition algorithm (DeepFace) reaches near-human accuracy in identifying faces.[240][241] |\n| 2014 | March 25 | Acquisition | Facebook announces that it is acquiring Oculus VR, Inc., a leading virtual reality company.[242][243] The amount is reported to be $2 billion in cash and stock.[244][245][246] |\n| 2014 | March 27 | Accessibility | Facebook announces a Connectivity Lab as part of the Internet.org initiative, with the goal of bringing the Internet to everybody via drones, using acqhires from Ascenta.[247][248][249][250] |\n| 2014 | April 24 | Product | Facebook announces FB Newswire to help journalists find news on its website.[59] |\n| 2014 | April 30 | Product, accessibility | Facebook launches anonymous login so that people can use apps without giving them their data.[251] |\n| 2014 | June 18 | Product (mobile-only) | Facebook releases Facebook Slingshot, an instant messaging software application for sharing photos and videos with friends, for Android and iOS devices.[252][253][254][255][256] |\n| 2014 | July 21 | Product | Facebook launches Save, a read-it-later feature that allows users to save links, places, and media pages for later perusal.[257] |\n| 2014 | September 15 onward | Userbase/controversy | Facebook cracks down on the Facebook profiles of drag queens in San Francisco, asking them to switch to using their real names, and shutting down the accounts of those who refuse to comply.[258] There is considerable pushback, including a planned protest at Facebook headquarters, that is delayed for a meeting with Facebook, but Facebook refuses to budge on its policy.[259] Many people, particularly those in or sympathetic to the LGBTQ community, sign up for competing social network Ello, that does not enforce a real names policy, promises to remain \"ad-free and porn-friendly\", and aims to have a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech.[260][261] On October 1, Facebook announced a clarification to its real name policy and said that drag queens could continue operating their accounts. The company clarified that people should use their authentic real-world names but need not use their legal names.[262] |\n| 2014 | October 6 | Acquisition | Facebook officially completes the acquisition of WhatsApp, and WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum agrees to match Mark Zuckerberg's $1 salary.[263] |\n| 2014 | October 23 | Product | Facebook launches pseudonymous app Rooms, where Facebook users can create and participate in forums on any topic and do not need to use their real names.[264] The forthcoming launch of the app had been reported on October 7.[265][266] |\n| 2014 | October 31 | Accessibility | Facebook creates a custom Tor link, making it easier for people to access Facebook anonymously in locations where it is censored.[267][268][269] |\n| 2014 | November 7 | Product (news feed) | Facebook makes it easy for people to unfollow friends and pages they've liked, both while viewing pages in the feed and while reviewing summaries of the most prolific contributors to their feed.[270][271] |\n| 2014 | December 8 | Product | Facebook rolls out keyword search for all posts, part of Facebook Graph Search, to all US English users on desktop and using iPhones.[272][273][274] It is cited as a potential competitor to Yelp and other product recommendation engines[275] and also as a potential way to surface old, embarrassing posts by people.[276] |\n| 2014 | December 11 | Outreach | Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg holds his second Q&A, open to the public, about Facebook, where he discusses the dislike button and Facebook's role in promoting viewpoint diversity, helping people share more, and facilitating social and political transparency.[277][278][279] |\n| 2015 | January 5 | Acquisition | Facebook acquires Wit.ai, a Y Combinator startup founded 18 months ago to create an API for building voice-activated interfaces.[280][281][282][283][284][285] |\n| 2015 | January 8 | Acquisition | Facebook acquires QuickFire Networks, a company that built a custom hardware and software platform for reducing video file sizes and upload times.

Currently, the company's leading apps include its main app, Messenger, and externally built and acquired apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp.[299] Specific announcements include making Facebook Messenger more of a platform, a new real-time comments system, embeddable videos, spherical video, Parse for the Internet of Things, updates to ad exchange LiveRail, and analytics for apps.[300] |\n| 2015 | March 26 | Open sourcing | Facebook releases its React native framework for building native apps as open source.

There is no corresponding iOS app, because iOS does not allow apps to interact with phone calls.[305][306][307] Commentators compare Facebook Hello to the native Android dialer app[308] and to TrueCaller, an app with crowdsourced data.[309] |\n| 2015 | April 28 (announcement), April 30 (closure) | Product, platform | Facebook announces that it is shutting down its friends data API, forcing developers to migrate to the Graph API.

Initial launch partners include *BuzzFeed*, the *New York Times*, *National Geographic* and six others. The article as displayed on Facebook mimics the article on the website in terms of layout, and Instant Articles allows for correct attribution and analytics with tools such as Google Analytics, Omniture, and Comscore, in addition to publishers benefiting from Facebook's own analytics. Publishers can choose to have only a subset of their content available as Instant Articles, and Facebook handles the porting of the article to the Instant Article format itself. *BuzzFeed* praised Facebook for complying with its requests for compatibility with analytics tracking, and said the process was very collaborative throughout. Load times are claimed to be ten times faster than the mobile web. Publishers can keep all the ad revenue if using their own ads, but Facebook gets a 30% cut if the ads are shown by Facebook.[313][314][315][316][317] |\n| 2015 | May 29 | Product (news feed) | Facebook confirms official support for GIFs. Autoplay settings for GIFs would be the same as those for videos: users who have video autoplay set to on (the default setting) will have GIFs autoplay when they scroll to the GIF in their news feed. Others can play the GIF manually by clicking the GIF button on the feed item with the GIF.[318] |\n| 2015 | June\u2013August | Product | Facebook adds more features for pages to make it easier for businesses to use them. These include: allowing pages to display how quickly they respond to messages,[319] allowing pages to send saved replies to messages,[320] allowing pages to use private messages for customer support,[321] and adding buy button integration to pages.[322] |\n| 2015 | June\u2013July | Product (news feed) | Facebook makes changes to its news feed algorithm in a few different directions. It relinquishes some control to users allowing them to dictate what they see first in the news feed.[323][324] Also, it announces that it will start using information on how long people hover on a particular item in their news feed to gauge their level of interest in the item, in addition to the more explicit signals it currently uses (likes, comments, shares).[325] |\n| 2015 | August | Product | On August 5, Facebook launches live-streaming, initially restricted only to celebrities.[326] Subsequently, on August 12, it announces that the feature will be made available to journalists and those with verified profiles.[327] |\n| 2015 | August 26 | Product | Facebook begins rolling out a human- and AI-powered virtual assistant called \"M\". M is available through Facebook's Messenger app, and is capable of performing tasks on behalf of users, including placing restaurant reservations and booking travel.[328][329] At launch, M is only available to a small group of testers, and in April 2016 Facebook would confirm that it could be years before M is broadly available.[330] |\n| 2015 | August 27 | Userbase | Facebook announces that it has hit the milestone of 1 billion users accessing it on a single day.[331] |\n| 2015 | October 27 | Accessibility | Facebook announces an initiative called 2G Tuesdays. With this initiative, Facebook engineers can opt in to access Facebook at 2G speeds for an hour every Tuesday (thus partly mimicking the experience of a nonnegligible fraction of Internet users in developing countries). The goal is to make Facebook engineers better understand the challenges of using Facebook with poor Internet speeds, and in turn help improve the Facebook experience for these users.[332][333] |\n| 2015 | December | Product | Facebook announces that it will add a feature for booking a ride through its messaging application. Users of Facebook Messenger in the U.S. will be able to summon an Uber car with a few taps.[334] |\n| 2016 | January\u00a0\u2013 March | Product | Facebook Live that was originally launched in August 2015 and limited to celebrities, becomes available to all U.S. iPhone users on January 28.[335][336] On February 18, the global rollout begins.[337] It becomes available to U.S. Android users in the week following February 26.[338] Starting March 1, Facebook starts pushing live content more compared to older content.[339] Commentators describe Facebook Live as marking Facebook's entry into the live-streaming space, competing with Twitter-owned Periscope.[335] |\n| 2016 | February 24 | Product | Facebook releases Facebook Reactions to the general public. The feature allows people to use five additional reactions beyond just the \"like\" action to convey their reaction to a post. The new reactions are \"Love\", \"Haha\", \"Wow\", \"Sad\", and \"Angry\" (another reaction, \"Yay\", that was used in initial testing of the feature, has been removed).[340] Although the names differ across languages, the emoticons used are the same across languages. Each user can add at most one reaction to a post.[341][342] An early version of Reactions was released in October 2015 in Ireland and Spain.[343][344] |\n| 2016 | March 18 | Product | Facebook provide \"Basketball Game\" function in Messenger.[345] |\n| 2016 | April 12 and 13 | Product | Facebook F8 for 2016 includes a number of announcements about the product roadmap. Key highlights include: Messenger chatbots and a new bot engine, open source virtual reality camera, more tools for Facebook apps and Facebook Live, allowing businesses to send sponsored messages to people who have messaged them in the past, more changes around improving rights management for videos, and increased support for React Native from Microsoft and Samsung.[346][347][348] |\n| 2016 | April 21 | Product (news feed) | Facebook announces that it is updating its news feed algorithm to take into account the time that a person spends reading the article, off Facebook (using various techniques to control for load time and article length). In the previous set of updates rolled out in June and July 2015, Facebook had started taking into account the time people spend viewing the item in their news feed, but the new change takes into account the user's activity outside Facebook. The change is part of Facebook's Feed Quality Program, and is a result of research showing that people's activity on Facebook failed to fully capture the extent to which they were interested in particular items.[349][350] Commentators believe that this is likely to lead to a significant reduction in the circulation of misleading clickbait on the social network.[351] |\n| 2016 | April 27 and 28 | Financial/legal, userbase | Facebook releases its 2016 Q1 earnings report, showing an increase in earnings to 77 cents per share up from 42 cents per share a year ago. The earnings beat analyst expectations, and cause Facebook share prices to soar, leading its market cap to exceed that of Johnson & Johnson. Facebook also reports an increase of 57% in advertising revenue to $5.2 billion, with mobile advertising now accounting for 82% of advertising revenue. It also reports a year-over-year increase in daily active users by 16% to 1.09 billion and in monthly active users by 15% to 1.65 billion.[352][353][354] Facebook also announces a proposal to create a new class of nonvoting stock.[354][355] |\n| 2016 | May | Product, controversy | Gizmodo publishes a series of articles about alleged problems with Facebook's Trending Topics section, including lack of integration of the Trending Topics team with Facebook's overall culture and workforce, discretion vested in that team to make decisions (including the ability to artificially inject content into Trending Topics even if it has not been trending so far), and potential for bias in the way the discretion is exercised, with a particular focus on bias against conservatism.[356][357][358] The controversy is picked up by other news media, the United States Senate Committee, and many conservative outlets.[359][360][361] Facebook defends itself against the allegations,[362] but also invites leading conservatives, including United States Republican presidential primary frontrunner Donald Trump, libertarian-leaning conservative commentator Glenn Beck (who is very impressed with Facebook's actions), and CNN commentator S. E. Cupp, for a meeting to discuss and address concerns.[363][364] On May 23, Facebook announces changes to its Trending Topics section, and releases a 28-page document on the subject.[365][366] |\n| 2016 | May 25 | Product | Facebook announces that it is shutting down Facebook Exchange (FBX), its desktop ad exchange. The reasons cited include that FBX makes a very small share of Facebook's ad revenue, and that it is of limited utility because is purely desktop-based, and any successful ad campaign must include mobile, that people are increasingly using.[367][368][369] |\n| 2016 | June 15 | Product | Facebook introduces the secret Messenger soccer game, similar to the basketball game.[370][371] |\n| 2016 | June 29 | Product (news feed) | Facebook publishes its list of \"News Feed Values\" that will guide its decisions and algorithms for the news feed. A core value listed is that friends and family come first, and Facebook announces that it is increasing the circulation of content about friends and family relative to publisher content.[372][373][374] |\n| 2016 | August 4 | Product (news feed) | Facebook announces algorithm changes that penalize \"clickbait\" titles, based on a score assigned by a machine-learned model. The model is trained based on cases where users like a link, click it, and then immediately bounce and unlike pages. The algorithm is applied both at the web domain level and at the Facebook page level.[375][376][377] |\n| 2016 | August 11 | Product (advertising) | Facebook and AdBlock Plus enter into an escalating war. AdBlock Plus tries to block advertisements and sponsored content on Facebook's site, but Facebook releases a workaround, to which AdBlock Plus releases its own workaround. Facebook's argument is that ad blockers are a crude solution, and Facebook's approach of giving users more fine-grained control over the content they see in the feed is superior. AdBlock Plus disagrees with the assessment and says ad blockers should not be blamed for users' desire to have an ad-free experience.[378][379][380] The ad blocking war continues into September[381][382] and discussion continues into November, with Facebook reportedly having boosted its ad revenue owing to its blocking of ad blockers.[383] |\n| 2016 | October 3 | Product | In the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand, Facebook launches Marketplace, a way to buy and sell items through Facebook. Marketplace appears as a tab in the mobile app.[384] The feature has been compared to Craigslist.[385] |\n| 2016 | November 30 | Product | Facebook launches in select countries[386] Instant Games on Messenger and Facebook News Feed, which allows users to play games without installing new apps. The games are provided via HTML5.

These include more streamlining for users reporting fake news, a partnership with signatory organizations to Poynter\u2019s International Fact Checking Code of Principles to examine items reported as fake, learning from lower share rates for people who view the article that the item might be fake, and warnings to users when they share news that is disputed or possibly fake.[390][391][392][393] |\n| 2017 | January 11 | Outreach | Facebook introduces the Facebook Journalism Project, an effort to bolster its relationship with media and news organizations and journalists.[394][395] |\n| 2017 | end of January | Product | Facebook begins integrating the Messenger interface into the messages inbox, replacing the old inbox interface. This change makes the Facebook messages inbox interface similar to that seen on messenger.com.[396] |\n| 2017 | February 15 | Product | In the United States and Canada, Facebook launches a feature to search for jobs. The feature allows businesses to post job openings through the status update composer, and allows users to apply to those job postings.[397][398][399][400] |\n| 2017 | February 16 |  | Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook's principal founder and CEO) pens a long note on his personal Facebook titled \"Building Global Community\" that talks about supportive, safe, informed, civically engaged, and inclusive community.[401] The note receives widespread discussion, including comparisons with a political manifesto.[402][403] |\n| 2017 | March 23 | Product (messaging) | Facebook adds reactions and mentions inside Messenger (both the app and the web experience).[404] |\n| 2017 | April 27 | Accessibility | Facebook launches Messenger Lite in over 100 additional countries.[405][406][407] |\n| 2017 | May 3 | Product | Facebook adds reactions to comments.

On March 30, the fundraising tools are introduced in beta.[416][417][418] On May 24, the product exits beta and is available in the United States for all users over 18 years of age.[419][420] |\n| 2017 | June 27 | Userbase | Facebook reaches 2 billion monthly active users.[421][422][423][424][425] |\n| 2017 | August 18 | Product (messaging) | Facebook Messenger rolls out rich text formatting, with support for bold, italics, inline code, and strike-through.[426] In addition, LaTeX math expressions are implemented through KaTeX.[427][428] |\n| 2017 | September 7 | Userbase/controversy | Facebook blocks 470 fake accounts after claiming them to be linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, which is suspect to have bought thousands of ads during the United States presidential campaign.[429] The company claims having discovered a Russian-funded campaign to promote divisive social and political messages on its network.[430] |\n| 2017 | September 27 | Controversy | United States president Donald Trump declares on Twitter that Facebook was always \"anti-Trump\".

Adults who have shared nude or sexually explicit photos with someone online, and who are worried about unauthorised distribution, under the program can securely send the photos to themselves via Messenger, a process that allows Facebook to \"hash\" them, creating an identifier which would block any further distribution on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger as a pre-emptive strike against revenge porn, a common method of abuse and exploitation online.[436][437][438] |\n| 2017 | November 16 | Product | In an effort to combat fake news and promote authentic, fact-based journalism, Facebook launches Trust Indicators, a tool to help users determine how each particular publication works.

Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65\u00a0billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater audience.\n\n\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of YouTube\n\n### Founding and initial growth (2005\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, the founders of YouTube.\nYouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)The YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007;[*citation needed*] it returned in 2008 before being removed again in 2010.[*citation needed*] Another version of this logo without the \"Broadcast Yourself\" slogan was used until 2011.\nYouTube began as a venture capital\u2013funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8\u00a0million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\nYouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[31] The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's *Saturday Night Live* ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for *Saturday Night Live*, \"Lazy Sunday\"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[32] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[33] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[34][35] The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100\u00a0million video views per day.[36]\n\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`. That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to `www.utubeonline.com`.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast Yourself era (2006\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65\u00a0billion in Google stock.[39][40] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[41][42] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[31] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth. *The Daily Telegraph* wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[43] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14\u00a0billion views of videos, according to comScore.[44] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site.[45] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute.[46][47][48] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[49] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red.[50][51] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[52] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[53][54]\n\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017\nDuring this time, the company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[55] Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as a chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[56]\n\n\nIn December 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[57] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" became the most viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on May 9, 2010.[58]\n\n\n\n### Susan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)YouTube logo since 2017\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[59] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215\u00a0million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[60] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[61]\n\n\nThrough this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[62][63] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[64][65] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[66] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key,\" which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[67] The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[68][69][70]\n\n\nThe company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[71] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming\u2014a video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[72]\n\n\nThe company was attacked on April 3, 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[73]\n\n\n\n### Recent history (2019\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[9][74] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute.[10] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. One data firm[*which?*] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level.[75] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request.[76] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\"[77]\n\n\nFollowing a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[78] the company was fined $170\u00a0million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13.[79] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[80][81] Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos designated as \"made for kids\" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[82][83] Joining the YouTube Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[84] Additionally, to compete with TikTok, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video platform.\n\n\nDuring this period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in 2018 and 2019, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[85] In 2020, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[86]\n\n\nAfter testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November 2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[87] While some users praised the move as a way to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines.\"[88][89][90] Shortly after the announcement, software developer Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[91] In a letter published on January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that \"it reduced dislike attacks.\"[92]\n\n\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor. Wojcicki will take on an advisory role for Google and parent company Alphabet.[95]\n\n\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message inviting them to subscribe to YouTube Premium. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[96][97]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\nYouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video codecs, and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol.[98] MPEG-4 Part 2 streams contained within 3GP containers are also provided for low bandwidth connections.[99] By January 2019, YouTube had begun rolling out videos in AV1 format.[100] In 2021 it was reported that the company was considering requiring AV1 in streaming hardware in order to decrease bandwidth and increase quality.[101] Video is usually streamed alongside the Opus and AAC audio codecs.[99]\n\n\nAt launch in 2005, viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser.[102] In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of Web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard.[103] This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed.[104] On January 27, 2015, YouTube announced that HTML5 would be the default playback method on supported browsers.[103] HTML5 video streams use Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an HTTP-based adaptive bit-rate streaming solution optimizes the bitrate and quality for the available network.[105]\n\n\nThe platform can serve videos at optionally lower resolution levels starting at 144p for smoothening playback in areas and countries with limited Internet speeds, improving compatibility, as well as for the preservation of limited cellular data plans. The resolution can be adjusted automatically based on detected connection speed or set manually.[106][107]\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2017, users could add \"annotations\" to their videos, such as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks, which allowed for interactive videos. By 2019 all annotations had been removed from videos, breaking some videos that depended on the feature. YouTube introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video).[108][109][110]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube became an International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) registry, and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features.[111]\n\n\nUsers can verify their account, normally through a mobile phone, to gain the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as produce live streams.[112][113] Users who have built sufficient channel history and have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines will also gain access to these aforementioned features as well.[114] When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload longer videos, but a 10-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.[115] The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.[116] Videos can be at most 256 GB in size or 12 hours, whichever is less.[112] As of 2021[update], automatic closed captions using speech recognition technology when a video is uploaded are available in 13 languages, and can be machine-translated during playback.[117]\n\n\nYouTube also offers manual closed captioning as part of its creator studio.[118] YouTube formerly offered a 'Community Captions' feature, where viewers could write and submit captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader, but this was deprecated in September 2020.[119]\n\n\nYouTube accepts the most common container formats, including MP4, Matroska, FLV, AVI, WebM, 3GP, MPEG-PS, and the QuickTime File Format. Some intermediate video formats (i.e., primarily used for professional video editing, not for final delivery or storage) are also accepted, such as ProRes.[120] YouTube provides recommended encoding settings.[121]\n\n\nEach video is identified by an eleven-character case-sensitive alphanumerical Base64 string in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which can contain letters, digits, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).[122]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube added a feature called *Premiere* which displays a notification to the user mentioning when the video will be available for the first time, like for a live stream but with a prerecorded video. When the scheduled time arrives, the video is aired as a live broadcast with a two-minute countdown. Optionally, a premiere can be initiated immediately.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Quality and formats[edit]\n\n\nYouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320\u00d7240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[124][125] with mono MP3 audio.[126] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[127] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480\u00d7360 pixels.[128] In December 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[129] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096\u00d73072 pixels.[130][131] In July 2010, support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840\u2009\u00d7\u20092160 pixels.[132] In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680\u00d74320 pixels.[133] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with hybrid log\u2013gamma (HLG) or perceptual quantizer (PQ).[134] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[135]\n\n\nIn June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to 60 frames per second (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October. YouTube stated that this would enhance \"motion-intensive\" videos, such as video game footage.[136][137][138][139]\n\n\nYouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. Viewers only indirectly influence the video quality. In the mobile apps, users choose between \"Auto\", which adjusts resolution based on the internet connection, \"High Picture Quality\" which will prioritize playing high-quality video, \"Data saver\" which will sacrifice video quality in favor of low data usage and \"Advanced\" which lets the user choose a stream resolution.[140] On desktop, users choose between \"Auto\" and a specific resolution.[141] It is not possible for the viewer to directly choose a higher bitrate (quality) for any selected resolution.\n\n\nSince 2009, viewers have had the ability to watch 3D videos.[142] In 2015, YouTube began natively supporting 360-degree video. Since April 2016, it allowed live streaming 360\u00b0 video, and both normal and 360\u00b0 video at up to 1440p, and since November 2016 both at up to 4K (2160p) resolution.[143][144][145] Citing the limited number of users who watched more than 90-degrees, it began supporting an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180 which it said was easier to produce,[146] which allows users to watch any video using virtual reality headsets.[147]\n\n\nIn response to increased viewership during the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube temporarily downgraded the quality of its videos.[148][149] YouTube developed its own chip, called Argos, to help with encoding higher resolution videos in 2021.[150]\n\n\nIn certain cases, YouTube allows the uploader to upgrade the quality of videos uploaded a long time ago in poor quality. One such partnership with Universal Music Group included remasters of 1,000 music videos.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Live streaming[edit]\n\n\nYouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including its YouTube Live event in 2008,[152] a concert by U2 in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010.[153] These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.[154] In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of *YouTube Live*. The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners.[155] It was used for real-time broadcasting of events such as the 2012 Olympics in London.[156] In October 2012, more than 8\u00a0million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.[157]\n\n\nIn May 2013, creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least 1,000 subscribers; in August of the same year the number was reduced to 100 subscribers,[158] and in December the limit was removed.[159] In February 2017, live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app. Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least 10,000 subscribers,[160] but as of mid-2017 it has been reduced to 100 subscribers.[161] Live streams support HDR, can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360\u00b0 video.[144][162]\n\n\n\n### User features[edit]\n\n\n#### Comment system [edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google \u00a7\u00a0YouTube user comments\n\nMost videos enable users to leave comments, which have attracted attention for the negative aspects of their form and content.[*specify*] In 2006, *Time* praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".[163] *The Guardian* in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:[164]\n\n\n\n\n> Juvenile, aggressive, misspelt, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance\u2014with the occasional burst of wit shining through.\n> \n> \n\n\n*The Daily Telegraph* commented in September 2008, that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".[165] *The Huffington Post* noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.[166]\n\n\nGoogle subsequently implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ on November 6, 2013, that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[167] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[168][169] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[170] The official YouTube announcement[171] received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[172] Writing in the *Newsday* blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network like Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and added that \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with the outcry against the new comment system\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[173]\n\n\n\n\n> Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.\n> Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.\n> \n> \n\n\nLater, on July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[174] On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[175] Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam. They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.[176]\n\n\nIn December 2020, it was reported that YouTube would launch a new feature that will warn users who post a comment that \"may be offensive to others.\"[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Community[edit]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate \"Community\" tab on their channel.[179] Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.[180][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nAfter the feature has been officially released, the *community post* feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers. This threshold was lowered over time,[*when?*] from 10,000 subscribers to 1500 subscribers, to 1000 subscribers,[181][*non-primary source needed*] to 500 subscribers.[182]\n\n\nChannels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (previously known as channel comments) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.[183][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### TestTube[edit]\n\n\nExperimental features of YouTube can be accessed in an area of the site named *TestTube*.[184][185]\n\n\nFor example, in October 2009, a *comment search* feature accessible under `/comment_search` was implemented as part of this program. The feature was removed later.[186]\n\n\nLater the same year, *YouTube Feather* was introduced as a \"lightweight\" alternative website for countries with limited internet speeds.[187]\n\n\n\n### Content accessibility[edit]\n\n\nYouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[188] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can make a \"video response\". The eleven character YouTube video identifier (64 possible characters used in each position), allows for a theoretical maximum of 6411 or around 73.8 quintillion (73.8 billion billion) unique ids.\n\n\nYouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature on August 27, 2013.[189] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[190] YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[191] A small number of videos can be downloaded as MP4 files.[192] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[193]\n\n\nIn February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[194] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[195] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[196] Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License,[197] but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose.\n\n\nSince July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Platforms[edit]\n\n\nMost modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[199] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[200]\n\n\nSince June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[201]\n\n\nThe mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5 in July 2010, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[202] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[203][204]\n\n\nIn September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[205] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.[206]\n\n\nA TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[207]\n\n\nIn January 2009, YouTube launched \"YouTube for TV\", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[208][209]\n\n\nDuring the month of June that same year, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[210] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[211]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[212] An app was available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, but was discontinued in August 2019.[213] Videos can also be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[214][*non-primary source needed*] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[215] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[216]\n\n\nYouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.[217]\n\n\n\n### International and localization[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system.[218] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

chosen based on the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message \"This video is not available in your country\" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[268] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Burmese, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and some material offensive to Muslims.[269][270] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain `youtube.com.tr`. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[271] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach an agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[272] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[273]\n\n\n\n## Videos[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[274] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[275]\n\n\nIn December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by *The Daily Dot* that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by *Billboard*, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[276][277] On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[278] YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.[279]\n\n\nSince September 2019, subscriber counts are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly, compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as that of Social Blade. Exact counts remain available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[280]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[281][282][283]\n\n\n\n### Copyright issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube copyright issues\n\nFurther information: \u00a7\u00a0Revenue to copyright holders\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[32] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[284] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[285][286] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[287][288][289]\n\n\nIn August 2008, a US court ruled in *Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.* that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material.[290] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[291]\n\n\nIn the 2011 case of *Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC*, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[292] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[293] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[294] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[295]\n\n\nIn April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[296][297] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels, which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[298] By 2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement depending on the record label.[299] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Content ID[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Content ID (system)\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[300] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\"[301][302] and later became known as Content ID,[303] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\nAn independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[305] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[306] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[307]\n\n\nBefore 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[308] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\".[309] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[310]\n\n\n\n### Moderation and offensive content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google \u00a7\u00a0YouTube, and Censorship by Google \u00a7\u00a0YouTube\n\nYouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\".[311][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[311] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.[311] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations,[312] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[313] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[314] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[315] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[312]\n\n\nYouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators, who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube's content policies and determines if they should be removed. In September 2020, a class-action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after an 18-month period on the job. The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube's stated limit of four hours per day of viewing graphic content. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube's contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderators' mental health, made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing, and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums. It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred, reduced in size or made monochrome, per recommendations from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company.[316][317][318]\n\n\nTo limit the spread of misinformation and fake news via YouTube, it has rolled out a comprehensive policy regarding how it plans to deal with technically manipulated videos.[319]\n\n\nControversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[320][321] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was \"unimpressed\" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that \"proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content\". YouTube responded by stating:\n\n\n\n\n> We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[322] (July 2008)\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[323] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[324] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[325]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.[326][327] In the wake of the Notre-Dame fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.[328]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2023, YouTube revealed its changes in handling content associated with eating disorders. This social media platform's Community Guidelines now prohibit content that could encourage emulation from at-risk users. This content includes behavior that shows severe calorie tracking and purging after eating. However, videos featuring positive behavior such as in the context of recovery will be permitted on the platform under two conditions\u2014the user must have a registered (logged-in) account and must be older than 18.\nThis policy was created in collaboration with nonprofit organizations as well as the National Eating Disorder Association. Garth Graham, YouTube's Global Head of Healthcare revealed in an interview with CNN that this policy change was geared at ensuring that this video-sharing platform provides an avenue for \"community recovery and resources\" while ensuring continued viewer protection.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Homophobia and transphobia[edit]\n\n\nFive leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ+ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms divert discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like \"lesbian\" or \"gay\", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.[330]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Media Matters, a media watchdog group, reported that homophobic and transphobic content calling LGBT people \"predators\" and \"groomers\" was becoming more common on YouTube.[331] The report also referred to common accusations in YouTube videos that LGBT people are mentally ill.[331] The report stated the content appeared to be in violation of YouTube's hate speech policy.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Animal torture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\nYouTube said animal abuse \"has no place on their platforms, and they are working to remove content\".[332][333][334][335][336][337]\n\n\n\n#### YouTube as a tool to promote conspiracy theories and far-right content[edit]\n\n\nYouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse.[338][339][340] According to an investigation by *The Wall Street Journal*, \"YouTube's recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content. When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\"[338][341] When users search for political or scientific terms, YouTube's search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[340][342] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources.[338][343][344][345] In 2018, it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news, giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain's death.[346]\n\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos, including videos by rape apologists, anti-Semites, and hate preachers who received ad payouts.[347] After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting, YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed.[347]\n\n\nAlex Jones, known for right-wing conspiracy theories, had built a massive audience on YouTube.[348] YouTube drew criticism in 2018 when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones, stating that it violated its policies on \"harassment and bullying\".[349] On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.[350]\n\n\nUniversity of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"[351] Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".[340][352]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy starting in the United States intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.[353] Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement.[354] In late 2019, the site began implementing measures directed towards \"raising authoritative content and reducing borderline content and harmful misinformation.\"[355]\n\n\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube. In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change.[356] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change.[357] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures.[358] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories.[359] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections.[360] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs.[361]\n\n\n\n#### Use among white supremacists[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech.[362]\n\n\nIn the wake of the March 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, YouTube and other sites like Facebook and Twitter that allowed user-submitted content drew criticism for doing little to moderate and control the spread of hate speech, which was considered to be a factor in the rationale for the attacks.[363][364] These platforms were pressured to remove such content, but in an interview with *The New York Times*, YouTube's chief product officer Neal Mohan said that unlike content such as ISIS videos which take a particular format and thus easy to detect through computer-aided algorithms, general hate speech was more difficult to recognize and handle, and thus could not readily take action to remove without human interaction.[365]\n\n\nYouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May 2019 to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations, to be implemented at the national level, to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech, though the United States declined to participate.[366][367] Subsequently, on June 5, 2019, YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service, \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\" YouTube identified specific examples of such videos as those that \"promote or glorify Nazi ideology, which is inherently discriminatory\". YouTube further stated it would \"remove content denying that well-documented violent events, like the Holocaust or the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, took place.\"[362][368]\n\n\nIn October 2019, YouTube banned the main channel of Red Ice, a white supremacist multimedia company, for hate speech violations. The channel had about 330,000 subscribers. Lana Lokteff and Red Ice promoted a backup channel in an attempt to circumvent the ban.[369][370] A week later, the backup channel was also removed by YouTube.[371][372]\n\n\nIn June 2020, YouTube banned several channels associated with white supremacy, including those of Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer, asserting these channels violated their policies on hate speech. The ban occurred the same day that Reddit announced the ban on several hate speech sub-forums including r/The Donald.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Handling of COVID-19 pandemic and other misinformation[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the dissemination via YouTube of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic that 5G communications technology was responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 which led to multiple 5G towers in the United Kingdom being attacked by arsonists, YouTube removed all such videos linking 5G and the coronavirus in this manner.[374]\n\n\nYouTube extended this policy in September 2021 to cover videos disseminating misinformation related to any vaccine, including those long approved against measles or Hepatitis B, that had received approval from local health authorities or the World Health Organization.[375][376] The platform removed the accounts of anti-vaccine campaigners such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola at this time.[376] Two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies.[375]\n\n\nYouTube had extended this moderation to non-medical areas. In the weeks following the 2020 United States presidential election, the site added policies to remove or label videos promoting disproving election fraud claims;[377] however, it reversed this policy in June 2023, citing that the removal was necessary to \"openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions\".[378] Google and YouTube implemented policies in October 2021 to deny monetization or revenue to advertisers or content creators that promoted climate change denial, which \"includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.\"[379]\n\n\nIn July 2022 YouTube announced policies to combat misinformation surrounding abortion, such as videos with instructions to perform abortion methods that are considered unsafe and videos that contain misinformation about the safety of abortion.[380]\n\n\n\n#### Child safety and wellbeing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: FamilyOFive, Fantastic Adventures scandal, and Elsagate\n\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material. In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[381][382] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel FamilyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[383][384][385][386] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owner of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[387]\n\n\nLater that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.[388][389][390][391] On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family-friendly characters. As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed *Toy Freaks*, a channel with over 8.5\u00a0million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.[392][393][394][395][396] According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to \u00a38.7\u00a0million annually prior to its deletion.[397]\n\n\nEven for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content.[398] Alternative, some of the most-watched children's programming on YouTube comes from channels that have no identifiable owners, raising concerns of intent and purpose. One channel that had been of concern was \"Cocomelon\" which provided numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children. Up through 2019, it had drawn up to US$10 million a month in ad revenue and was one of the largest kid-friendly channels on YouTube before 2020. Ownership of Cocomelon was unclear outside of its ties to \"Treasure Studio\", itself an unknown entity, raising questions as to the channel's purpose,[398][399][400] but *Bloomberg News* had been able to confirm and interview the small team of American owners in February 2020 regarding \"Cocomelon\", who stated their goal for the channel was to simply entertain children, wanting to keep to themselves to avoid attention from outside investors.[401] The anonymity of such channel raise concerns because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve.[402] The difficulty to identify who operates these channels \"adds to the lack of accountability\", according to Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, and educational consultant Ren\u00e9e Chernow-O'Leary found the videos were designed to entertain with no intent to educate, all leading to critics and parents to be concerned for their children becoming too enraptured by the content from these channels.[398] Content creators that earnestly make child-friendly videos have found it difficult to compete with larger channels, unable to produce content at the same rate as them, and lacking the same means of being promoted through YouTube's recommendation algorithms that the larger animated channel networks have shared.[402]\n\n\nIn January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as the Tide Pod Challenge) and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.[403]\n\n\n\n##### Sexualization of children and pedophilia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Elsagate\n\nAlso in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children\u2014often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics\u2014were attracting comments from pedophiles[404][405] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.[405] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.[406]\n\n\nAs a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.[391][407] In December 2018, *The Times* found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting overtly sexual poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.[408] After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after *The Times* contacted YouTube's PR department.[408]\n\n\nIn February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos.[409] Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had re-uploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.[410] In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A spokesperson explained that \"any content\u2014including comments\u2014that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"[411][412] Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and Nestl\u00e9 all pulled their advertising from YouTube.[410][413]\n\n\nSubsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.[414] YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. \"Trusted partners\" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.[415][416]\n\n\nA related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in some prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game *Pok\u00e9mon Go* (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and *Club Penguin*. YouTube apologized for the errors and reinstated the affected videos.[417] Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.[418]\n\n\nIn June 2019, *The New York Times* cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.[419] As a result, Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as \"recommended\" videos, excluding those that were \"professionally produced\", such as videos of televised talent shows.[420] YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.[421]\n\n\n\n#### Misogyny[edit]\n\n\nA January 2022 report by the social media analytics firm Bot Sentinel said that several online influencers were using YouTube to exclusively post negative content about Prince Harry and Meghan, including conspiracy theories about the couple, in what it called \"a lucrative hate-for-profit enterprise\" where \"racism and YouTube ad revenue are the primary motivators.\" Bot Sentinel also found that one of the most prominent accounts promoting a conspiracy theory that Meghan was never pregnant had accumulated nearly 19 million views and was earning around $44,000 a year. YouTube banned the account in March.[422]\n\n\nAn August 2022 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British think tank, found that harassment against women was flourishing on YouTube. It noted that channels espousing a similar ideology to that of men's rights influencer Andrew Tate were using YouTube to grow their audience, despite Tate being banned from the platform.[423] In his 2022 book *Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise to World Domination*, Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen said that many female content creators were dealing with harassment, bullying and stalking.[423]\n\n\n\n### April Fools gags[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Google April Fools' Day jokes\n\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\".[424][425] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\".[426] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"[427]\n\n\nThe next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[428] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[429]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company *The Onion* to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[430][431]\n\n\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[432] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[433] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[434]\n\n\n\n## Services[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube Premium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Premium\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Premium\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[435] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[436][437][438] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[439][440][441] As of November\u00a02016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[442] As of June\u00a02017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[443]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Kids[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Kids\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Kids\nYouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed in response to parental and government scrutiny on the content available to children. The app provides a version of the service-oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children aged under 13, 8 or 5 depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.\n\n\n\n### YouTube Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Music\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Music\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[444]\n\n\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[445] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Movies[edit]\n\n\nYouTube Movies is a service by YouTube that shows movies via its website. Around 100\u2013500 movies are free to view, with ads. Some new movies get added and some get removed, unannounced at a new month.[448]\n\n\n\n### YouTube TV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube TV\n\n![](image)YouTube TV logo\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[449][450] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Turner Broadcasting System (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[451][452]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Go[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Go\nIn September 2016, *YouTube Go* was announced,[453] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[454]\n\n\nIn February 2017, *YouTube Go* was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[455][456] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[457][458] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down *YouTube Go* in August 2022.[459]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Shorts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Shorts\n\nAn example video that is suitable for YouTube Shorts, showing Crew Dragon *Endeavour* docking at the International Space Station\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[460][461] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long.[462] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app. Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos.[463] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021.[464]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\".[465] The feature is nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\". It is only available to creators who have more than 10,000 subscribers and can only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[466] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that it would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023.[467][468]\n\n\n\n## Social impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social impact of YouTube\n\nPrivate individuals[469] and large production corporations[470] have used YouTube to grow their audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[469] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[470] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer\u2014its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[471] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5\u00a0million to $12\u00a0million[472]\u2014in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels.\"[473] In 2013 *Forbes*' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[474] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[475] By early 2013, *Billboard* had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the *Billboard* Hot 100 and related genre charts.[476]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan Hoffner at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards accepting for YouTube\nObserving that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication.\"[477] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\"[477] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what *Forbes'* Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world,\" with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[478] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[479] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\"[480] *The Washington Post* reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[481] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[482] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[483]\n\n\nYouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[484] Describing the Arab Spring (2010\u20132012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\"[485] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"[486]\n\n\n\n![](image)Leading YouTube content creators met at the White House with U.S. President Obama to discuss how government could better connect with the \"YouTube generation.\"[487][488]\nConversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[489] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[490] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[491] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation.\"[487] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[487]\n\n\nSome YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as *Innocence of Muslims* (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[492] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[477] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in *The New York Times* that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[493]\n\n\nA 2017 article in *The New York Times Magazine* posited that YouTube had become \"the new talk radio\" for the far right.[494] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a \"gradual change\" of \"reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways\",[495] Zeynep Tufekci had written in *The New York Times* that, \"(g)iven its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century\".[496] Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most recommended channel evolved from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[497] According to a 2020 study, \"An emerging journalistic consensus theorizes the central role played by the video 'recommendation engine,' but we believe that this is premature. Instead, we propose the 'Supply and Demand' framework for analyzing politics on YouTube.\"[498] A 2022 study found that \"despite widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture\", \"exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment.\", and \"contrary to the 'rabbit holes' narrative, non-subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered.\"[499]\n\n\n*The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers*[500] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[501] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[477][501] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[502] with *The Tokyo Times* noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[503]\nThe anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[504] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[505] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm,\" legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[506] In May 2018, after London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[507]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing.[508] In June 2008, a *Forbes* magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200\u00a0million, noting progress in advertising sales.[509] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7\u00a0billion.[510] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6\u00a0billion according to eMarketer,[510][511] while others estimated $4.7\u00a0billion.[510] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[62] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[512] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[62]\n\n\nGoogle first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019 financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10% of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[513][514] These revenues accounted for approximately 20\u00a0million subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2\u00a0million subscribers to YouTube TV.[515]\n\n\nYouTube had $19.8\u00a0billion in revenue in 2020.[516]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with corporations[edit]\n\n\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[517] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[518] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[519][520] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[521] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[522] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[523][524][*needs update*] The service offers over 6,000 films.[525]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 advertiser boycott[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\". *The Guardian* newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\".[526][527] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a *Wall Street Journal* article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[528][529]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[530]\n\n\n\n### YouTuber earnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Total annual earnings of the top ten YouTuber accounts, and the income of the single highest-earning account.\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[531] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[532][533]\n\n\nThere are over two million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[534] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[535]\n\n\nYouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"),[536] and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content.[537]\n\n\nIn 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.[538][539] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[540] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[540] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[541]\n\n\nYouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[542] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million, fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[543][544]\n\n\nYouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[545] sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\".[546] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\".[547][548][549] *Boing Boing* reported in 2019 that LGBT keywords resulted in demonetization.[550]\n\n\nAs of November 2020 in the United States and June 2021 worldwide,[551] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed \"advertiser-friendly\", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the uploader.[552]\n\n\n\n### Revenue to copyright holders[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: \u00a7\u00a0Copyrighted material\n\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[553] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[554] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[555] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program.[556][557][558] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[559][560]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and bans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship of YouTube\n\n![](image)Availability of YouTube as of January 2021:  \n Has local YouTube version\n Accessible (Worldwide version)\n Currently blocked\n Previously blocked\n\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[561]\n\n\n\n* Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.\n* Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions (e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in Pakistan).\n* Morality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.\n\n\nAccess to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate for youth,[562] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with \"restricted mode\".[563] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[564][565] and the site's potential for distraction.[561][566]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], public access to YouTube is blocked in many countries, including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[567] Uzbekistan,[568][569] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[561]\n\n\nReports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the Chinese Communist Party (\u5171\u532a or \"communist bandit\") or (\u4e94\u6bdb or \"50 Cent Party\", referring to state-sponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[570]\n\n\nSpecific incidents where YouTube has been blocked include:\n\n\n\n* Thailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.[571]\n* Morocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara.[572] YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after *Maroc Telecom* unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere \"technical glitch\".[573]\n* Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.[574][575][576] In November 2010, a video of the Turkish politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.[577] During the two and a half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed site in Turkey.[578][579] In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after \"a high-level intelligence leak.\"[580][581][582]\n* Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of \"offensive material\" towards the Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.[583] This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government.[584][585] Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private network software.[586] In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing \"growing sacrilegious content\".[587] The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked.[588][589] Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film *Innocence of Muslims*. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.[590]\n* Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch.[591] In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.[592]\n* Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012 following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film *Innocence of Muslims* which had been posted on the site.[593][594][595][596][597] A court in the southern Russian Republic of Chechnya ruled that *Innocence of Muslims* should be banned.[598] In Libya and Egypt, it was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: \"This video\u2014which is widely available on the Web\u2014is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries.\"[599][600]\n* Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[601] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March 1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian-government funded outlets) from its platform in Europe.[602]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Invidious, a free and open-source alternative frontend to YouTube\n* Alternative media\n* BookTube\n* BreadTube\n* CNN/YouTube presidential debates\n* Lists\n\t+ Comparison of video hosting services\n\t+ List of Google Easter eggs#YouTube\n\t+ List of Internet phenomena\n\t+ List of most-disliked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-liked YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-viewed YouTube videos\n\t+ List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n\t+ List of online video platforms\n\t+ List of YouTubers\n* Lawsuits\n\t+ *Viacom International Inc. v.

A month earlier, after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phone's Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.[62]\n\n\nTheir discussions often took place at the home of Koum's Russian friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose. They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.[62]\n\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated[63] WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a \"few more months\".[62]\n\n\nIn June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by only a handful of Fishman's Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app.\n\n\nKoum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network would be notified when a user's status changed. This new facility, to Koum's surprise, was used by users to ping \"each other with jokey custom statuses like, 'I woke up late' or 'I'm on my way.'\"[62]\n\n\nFishman said \"At some point it sort of became instant messaging\".[62]\n\n\nWhatsApp 2.0, released for iPhone in August 2009, featured a purpose-designed messaging component; the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000.\n\n\nAlthough Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.[27] In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed funding, and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.[27] Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[27] Subsequently, WhatsApp for Symbian OS was added in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010.[64] In 2010 Google made multiple acquisition offers for WhatsApp, which were all declined.[65]\n\n\nTo cover the cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iOS version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20 apps in the U.S. Apple App Store.[27]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Sequoia Capital invested about $8 million for more than 15% of the company, after months of negotiation by Sequoia partner Jim Goetz.[66][67][68]\n\n\nBy February 2013, WhatsApp had about 200 million active users and 50 staff members. Sequoia invested another $50 million, and WhatsApp was valued at $1.5 billion.[27] Some time in 2013[69] WhatsApp acquired Santa Clara-based startup SkyMobius, the developers of Vtok,[70] a video and voice calling app.[71]\n\n\nIn a December 2013 blog post, WhatsApp claimed that 400 million active users used the service each month.[72] The year 2013 ended with $148 million in expenses, of which $138 million in losses.[73]\n\n\n\n### 2014\u20132015[edit]\n\n\nOn February 19, 2014, one year after a venture capital financing round at a $1.5\u00a0billion valuation,[74] Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19\u00a0billion, its largest acquisition to date.[23] At the time, it was the largest acquisition of a venture-capital-backed company in history.[22] Sequoia Capital received an approximate 5,000% return on its initial investment.[75] Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4\u00a0billion in cash, $12\u00a0billion in Facebook shares, and, advised by Morgan Stanley, an additional $3\u00a0billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders Koum and Acton.[76] Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing.[23] Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media.[77]\n\n\nThe acquisition was influenced by the data provided by Onavo, Facebook's research app for monitoring competitors and trending usage of social activities on mobile phones, as well as startups that were performing \"unusually well\".[78][79][80]\n\n\nThe acquisition caused many users to try, or move to, other message services. Telegram claimed that it acquired 8\u00a0million new users;[81] and Line, 2\u00a0million.[82]\n\n\n\nAt a keynote presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp was closely related to the Internet.org vision.[83][84] A *TechCrunch* article said about Zuckerberg's vision:\n\n\n> The idea, he said, is to develop a group of basic internet services that would be free of charge to use \u2013 \"a 911 for the internet\". These could be a social networking service like Facebook, a messaging service, maybe search and other things like weather. Providing a bundle of these free of charge to users will work like a gateway drug of sorts \u2013 users who may be able to afford data services and phones these days just don't see the point of why they would pay for those data services. This would give them some context for why they are important, and that will lead them to pay for more services like this \u2013 or so the hope goes.[83]\n> \n> \n\n\nThree days after announcing the Facebook purchase, Koum said they were working to introduce voice calls. He also said that new mobile phones would be sold in Germany with the WhatsApp brand, and that their ultimate goal was to be on all smartphones.[85]\n\n\nIn August 2014, WhatsApp was the most popular messaging app in the world, with more than 600\u00a0million users.[86] By early January 2015, WhatsApp had 700\u00a0million monthly users and over 30\u00a0billion messages every day.[87] In April 2015, *Forbes* predicted that between 2012 and 2018, the telecommunications industry would lose $386\u00a0billion because of \"over-the-top\" services like WhatsApp and Skype.[88] That month, WhatsApp had over 800\u00a0million users.[89][90] By September 2015, it had grown to 900\u00a0million;[91] and by February 2016, one billion.[92]\n\n\nOn November 30, 2015, the Android WhatsApp client made links to messaging service Telegram unclickable and uncopyable.[93][94][95] Multiple sources confirmed that it was intentional, not a bug,[95] and that it had been implemented when the Android source code that recognized Telegram URLs had been identified.[95] (The word \"telegram\" appeared in WhatsApp's code.[95]) Some considered it an anti-competitive measure;[93][94][95] WhatsApp offered no explanation.\n\n\n\n### 2016\u20132019[edit]\n\n\nOn January 18, 2016, WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum announced that it would no longer charge users a $1 annual subscription fee, in an effort to remove a barrier faced by users without payment cards.[96][97] He also said that the app would not display any third-party ads, and that it would have new features such as the ability to communicate with businesses.[92][98]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2017, the European Commission announced that it was fining Facebook \u20ac110\u00a0million for \"providing misleading information about WhatsApp takeover\" in 2014. The Commission said that in 2014 when Facebook acquired the messaging app, it \"falsely claimed it was technically impossible to automatically combine user information from Facebook and WhatsApp.\" However, in the summer of 2016, WhatsApp had begun sharing user information with its parent company, allowing information such as phone numbers to be used for targeted Facebook advertisements. Facebook acknowledged the breach, but said the errors in their 2014 filings were \"not intentional\".[99]\n\n\nIn September 2017, WhatsApp's co-founder Brian Acton left the company to start a nonprofit group,[100] later revealed as the Signal Foundation, which developed the WhatsApp competitor Signal.[101] He explained his reasons for leaving in an interview with Forbes a year later.[102] WhatsApp also announced a forthcoming business platform to enable companies to provide customer service at scale,[103] and airlines KLM and Aerom\u00e9xico announced their participation in the testing.[104][105][106][107] Both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.\n\n\nIn January 2018, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Business for small business use.[108]\n\n\nIn April 2018, WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum announced he would be leaving the company.[109] By leaving before November 2018, due to concerns about privacy, advertising, and monetization by Facebook,[110] Acton and Koum gave up $1.3 billion in unvested stock options.[111] Facebook later announced that Koum's replacement would be Chris Daniels.[112]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2019, WhatsApp announced an investment of $250,000 through a partnership with Startup India to provide 500 startups with Facebook ad credits of $500 each.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2019, WhatsApp announced that a new update would lock out any Apple users who hadn't updated to iOS 9 or higher and Samsung, Huawei, Sony and Google users who hadn't updated to version 4.0 by February 1, 2020. The company also reported that Windows Phone operating systems would no longer be supported after December 31, 2019.[114] WhatsApp was announced to be the 3rd most downloaded mobile phone app of the decade 2010\u20132019.[115]\n\n\n\n### Since 2020[edit]\n\n\nIn March, WhatsApp partnered with the World Health Organization and UNICEF to provide messaging hotlines for people to get information on the 2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic.[116] In the same month WhatsApp began testing a feature to help users find out more information and context about information they receive to help combat misinformation.[117][118][119][120]\n\n\nIn January 2021, WhatsApp announced a controversial new Privacy Policy allowing WhatsApp to share data with its parent company, Facebook; users who did not accept by February 8, 2021, would lose access to the app. This led many users to ditch WhatsApp and move to other services such as Signal and Telegram.[121] However, Facebook said the WhatsApp policy would not apply in the EU, since it violates the principles of GDPR.[122][123] Facing criticism, WhatsApp postponed the update to May 15, 2021,[124][125] but said they had no plans to limit functionality of users, nor nag users who did not approve the new terms.[126]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2021, Facebook had its worst outage since 2008, which also affected other platforms owned by Facebook, such as Instagram and WhatsApp.[127][128]\n\n\nIn August 2022, WhatsApp launched an integration with JioMart, available only to users in India. Local users can text special numbers in the app to launch an in-app shopping process, where they can order groceries.[129]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, a slate of improvements for the iOS version of WhatsApp were released: including the ability to search for messages in your chat history, trimming long videos to a sendable size, the ability to cancel media messages as they upload or download, and previewing photos before sending them.[130]\n\n\nIn March 2012, WhatsApp improved its location-sharing function, allowing users to share not only their location, but also the location of places, such as restaurants or hotels.[130]\n\n\nIn August 2013, WhatsApp added voice messages to their apps, giving users a way to send short audio recordings directly in their chats.[131][132]\n\n\nIn January 2015, WhatsApp launched a web client that allowed users to scan a QR code with their mobile app, mirroring their chats to their browser. The web client was not standalone, and required the user's phone to stay on and connected to the internet. It was also not available for iOS users on launch, due to limitations from Apple.[133][134]\n\n\nVoice calls between two accounts were added to the app in March and April 2015.[135] By June 2016, the company's blog reported more than 100 million voice calls per day were being placed on WhatsApp.[136]\n\n\nOn November 10, 2016, WhatsApp launched a beta version of two-factor authentication for Android users, which allowed them to use their email addresses for further protection.[137] Also in November 2016, Facebook ceased collecting WhatsApp data for advertising in Europe.[99] Later that month, video calls between two accounts were introduced.[138]\n\n\nOn February 24, 2017, (WhatsApp's 8th birthday), WhatsApp launched a new Status feature similar to Snapchat and Facebook stories.[139]\n\n\nLater in September 2018, WhatsApp introduced group audio and video call features.[140][141] In October, the \"Swipe to Reply\" option was added to the Android beta version, 16 months after it was introduced for iOS.[142]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2018, WhatsApp announced support for Stickers. But unlike other platforms WhatsApp requires third-party apps to add Stickers to WhatsApp.[143]\n\n\nIn October 2019, WhatsApp officially launched a new fingerprint app-locking feature for Android users.[144]\n\n\nIn early 2020, WhatsApp launched its \"dark mode\" for iPhone and Android devices \u2013 a new design consisting of a darker palette.[145]\n\n\nIn October 2020, WhatsApp rolled out a feature allowing users to mute both individuals and group chats forever. The mute options are \"8 hours\", \"1 week\", and \"Always\". The \"Always\" option replaced the \"1 year\" option that was originally part of the settings.[146][147]\n\n\nIn March 2021, WhatsApp started rolling out support for third-party animated stickers, initially in Iran, Brazil and Indonesia,[148] then worldwide.[149]\n\n\nIn July 2021, WhatsApp announced forthcoming support for sending uncompressed images and videos in 3 options: Auto, Best Quality and Data Saver,[150] and end-to-end encryption for backups stored in Facebook's cloud.[151] The company was also testing multi-device support, allowing Computer users to run WhatsApp without an active phone session.[152]\n\n\nIn August 2021, WhatsApp launched a feature that allows chat history to be transferred between mobile operating systems. This was implemented only on Samsung phones, with plans to expand to Android and iOS \"soon\".[153]\n\n\nWhatsApp has the facility to hide users' online status (\"Last Seen\"). In December 2021, WhatsApp changed the default setting from \"everyone\" to only people in the user's contacts or who have been conversed with (\"nobody\" is also an option).[154]\n\n\nIn April 2022, WhatsApp announced undated plans to roll out a Communities feature allowing several group chats to exist in a shared space, getting unified notifications and opening up smaller discussion groups. The company also announced plans to implement reactions, the ability for administrators to delete messages in groups and voice calls up to 32 participants.[155]\n\n\nIn May 2022, the file upload limit was raised from 100 MB to 2 GB, and maximum group size increased to 512 members.[156]\n\n\nIn April 2023, the app rolled out a feature that would allow account access across multiple phones, in a shift that would make it more like competitors. Messages would still be end-to-end encrypted.[157]\nWhatsApp officially rolled out the Companion mode for Android users, allowing you to link up to five Android phones to a single account. Now, the feature is also made available to iOS users, allowing them to link up to four iPhones.[158]\n\n\nIn May 2023, WhatsApp allowed users to edit messages, aligning itself with competitors such as Telegram and Signal which already offered this feature. According to the company, messages could be edited within a 15-minute window after being sent. Edited messages were tagged as \"edited\" to inform recipients that the content had been modified.[159] WhatsApp has rolled out a feature called 'Voice Status Updates', which allows users to record voice notes and share them as their status on the app.[160]\n\n\nIn June 2023, a feature called WhatsApp Channels was launched which allows content creators, public figures and organizations to send newsletter-like broadcasts to large numbers of users. Unlike messages in groups or private chats, channels are not end-to-end encrypted.[161] Channels were initially only available to users in Colombia and Singapore, then later Egypt, Chile, Malaysia, Morocco, Ukraine, Kenya and Peru before becoming widely available in September 2023.[162][163][164][165]\n\n\nIn July 2023, video messages were added to WhatsApp. Similar to voice messages, this feature allows users to record and send short videos directly in a chat. This lets users share videos of themselves more quickly, and without adding anything to their device's gallery. Currently, video messages are limited to 60 seconds.[166][167]\n\n\nIn October 2023, support for logging in to multiple accounts was added, allowing users to switch between different WhatsApp accounts in the same app. They also introduced passkey support, where a user can verify their login with on-device biometrics, rather than SMS. Text formatting options like code blocks, quote blocks, and bulleted lists and became available for the first time. [168]\n\n\nIn November 2023, WhatsApp added a \"voice chat\" feature for groups with more than 32 members. Unlike their 32-person group calls, starting a voice chat doesn't call all group members directly; they instead receive a notification to join the voice chat.[169]\n\n\n\n## Platform support[edit]\n\n\n### Platform history[edit]\n\n\nAfter months at beta stage, the official first release of WhatsApp for iOS launched in November 2009. In January 2010, support for BlackBerry smartphones was added; and subsequently for Symbian OS in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010. In August 2011, a beta for Nokia's non-smartphone OS Series 40 was added. A month later, support for Windows Phone was added, followed by BlackBerry 10 in March 2013.[170] In April 2015, support for Samsung's Tizen OS was added.[171] The oldest device capable of running WhatsApp was the Symbian-based Nokia N95 released in March 2007, but support was later discontinued.\n\n\nIn August 2014, WhatsApp released an update, adding support for Android Wear smartwatches.[172]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2015, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Web, a browser-based web client that could be used by syncing with a mobile device's connection.[173]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2016, WhatsApp announced they would cease support for BlackBerry (including BlackBerry 10), Nokia Series 40, and Symbian S60,[174][175] as well as older versions of Android (2.2), Windows Phone (7.0), and iOS (6), by the end of 2016.[176] BlackBerry, Nokia Series 40, and Symbian support was then extended to June 30, 2017.[177] In June 2017, support for BlackBerry and Series 40 was once again extended until the end of 2017, while Symbian was dropped.[178]\n\n\nSupport for BlackBerry and older (version 8.0) Windows Phone and older (version 6) iOS devices was dropped on January 1, 2018, but was extended to December 2018 for Nokia Series 40.[179] In July 2018, it was announced that WhatsApp would soon be available for KaiOS feature phones.[180][181]\n\n\n\n### Android and iPhone[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp's principal platforms, which are fully supported, are devices supporting mobile telephony running Android, and iPhones.[182]\n\n\n\n### WhatsApp Web[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp was officially made available for PCs through a web client, under the name WhatsApp Web,[183] in late January 2015 through an announcement made by Koum on his Facebook page: \"Our web client is simply an extension of your phone: the web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device\u2014this means all of your messages still live on your phone\". As of January 21, 2015, the desktop version was only available to Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone users. Later on, it also added support for iOS, Nokia Series 40, and Nokia S60 (Symbian).[184][185]\nPreviously the WhatsApp user's handset had to be connected to the Internet for the browser application to function but as of an update in October 2021 that is no longer the case.[186] All major desktop browsers are supported except for Internet Explorer. WhatsApp Web's user interface is based on the default Android one and can be accessed through web.whatsapp.com. Access is granted after the users scan their personal QR code through their mobile WhatsApp application.\n\n\nThere are similar solutions for macOS, such as the open-source *ChitChat*, previously known as *WhatsMac*.[187][188][189]\n\n\nIn January 2021, the limited Android beta version allowed users to use WhatsApp Web without having to keep the mobile app connected to the Internet. In March 2021, this beta feature was extended to iOS users.[190] However, linked devices (using WhatsApp Web, WhatsApp Desktop or Facebook Portal) will become disconnected if people don't use their phone for over 14 days.[191] The multi-device beta can only show messages for the last 3 months on the web version, which was not the case without the beta because the web version was syncing with the phone.[192]\nSince April 2022, the multi-device beta is integrated by default in WhatsApp and users cannot check old messages on the web version anymore.[193][194]\n\n\n\n### Windows and Mac[edit]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2016, the messaging service was introduced for both Microsoft Windows and macOS operating systems. Support for video and voice calls from desktop clients was later added. Similar to the WhatsApp Web format, the app, which synchronises with a user's mobile device, is available for download on the website. It supported operating systems Windows 8 and OS X 10.10 and higher.[195][196][197]\n\n\nIn 2023, WhatsApp replaced the Electron based apps with native versions for their respective platforms.[198][199] The Windows version is based on UWP while the Mac version is a port of the iOS version using Catalyst technology.\n\n\n\n### Smartwatches[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp added support for Android Wear (now called Wear OS) in 2014.[172]\n\n\n\n### iPad not supported[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], WhatsApp does not have an official iPad client.[182] While the majority of iPhone apps can run on the iPad in an iPhone sized window, WhatsApp was one of the very few apps to be completely unavailable on the iPad due to the \"telephony\" restriction. In a 2022 interview with *The Verge*, WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart acknowledged that \"[p]eople have wanted an iPad app for a long time\" and said that the team would \"love to do it.\"[200] In September 2023, a beta version of WhatsApp was released for iPad. No official release date has been announced.[201]\n\n\niPad users searching for WhatsApp are shown numerous third-party clients. Several top results have names and logos resembling WhatsApp itself, and some users do not realize they are using a third-party client. Per WhatsApp's policy, using third-party clients can result in the account getting permanently banned.[202]\n\n\n\n## Technical[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp uses a customized version of the open standard Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).[203] Upon installation, it creates a user account using the user's phone number as the username (Jabber ID: `[phone number]@s.whatsapp.net`).\n\n\nWhatsApp software automatically compares all the phone numbers from the device's address book with its central database of WhatsApp users to automatically add contacts to the user's WhatsApp contact list. Previously the Android and Nokia Series 40 versions used an MD5-hashed, reversed-version of the phone's IMEI as password,[204] while the iOS version used the phone's Wi-Fi MAC address instead of IMEI.[205][206] A 2012 update implemented generation of a random password on the server side.[207] Alternatively a user can send to any contact in the WhatsApp database through the url `https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=[phone number]` where `[phone number]` is the number of the contact including the country code.\n\n\nSome devices using dual SIMs may not be compatible with WhatsApp, though there are unofficial workarounds to install the app.[208]\n\n\nIn February 2015, WhatsApp implemented voice calling, which helped WhatsApp to attract a different segment of the user population.[209][210] WhatsApp's voice codec is Opus,[211][212][213] which uses the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) and linear predictive coding (LPC) audio compression algorithms.[214] WhatsApp uses Opus at 8\u201316 kHz sampling rates.[211][213] On November 14, 2016, WhatsApp video calling for users using Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone devices.[215][216]\n\n\nIn November 2017, WhatsApp implemented a feature giving users seven minutes to delete messages sent by mistake.[217]\n\n\nMultimedia messages are sent by uploading the image, audio or video to be sent to an HTTP server and then sending a link to the content along with its Base64 encoded thumbnail, if applicable.[218]\n\n\nWhatsApp uses a \"store and forward\" mechanism for exchanging messages between two users. When a user sends a message, it is stored on a WhatsApp server, which tries to forward it to the addressee, and repeatedly requests acknowledgement of receipt. When the message is acknowledged, the server deletes it; if undelivered after 30 days, it is also deleted.[219][*self-published source?*]\n\n\n\n### End-to-end encryption[edit]\n\n\nOn November 18, 2014, Open Whisper Systems announced a partnership with WhatsApp to provide end-to-end encryption by incorporating the encryption protocol used in Signal into each WhatsApp client platform.[220] Open Whisper Systems said that they had already incorporated the protocol into the latest WhatsApp client for Android, and that support for other clients, group/media messages, and key verification would be coming soon after.[221] WhatsApp confirmed the partnership to reporters, but there was no announcement or documentation about the encryption feature on the official website, and further requests for comment were declined.[222] In April 2015, German magazine *Heise Security* used ARP spoofing to confirm that the protocol had been implemented for Android-to-Android messages, and that WhatsApp messages from or to iPhones running iOS were still not end-to-end encrypted.[223] They expressed the concern that regular WhatsApp users still could not tell the difference between end-to-end encrypted messages and regular messages.[223]\n\n\nOn April 5, 2016, WhatsApp and Open Whisper Systems announced that they had finished adding end-to-end encryption to \"every form of communication\" on WhatsApp, and that users could now verify each other's keys.[55][224] Users were also given the option to enable a trust on first use mechanism in order to be notified if a correspondent's key changes.[225] According to a white paper that was released along with the announcement, WhatsApp messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol.[226] WhatsApp calls are encrypted with SRTP, and all client-server communications are \"layered within a separate encrypted channel\".[226]\n\n\nOn October 14, 2021, WhatsApp rolled out end-to-end encryption for backups on Android and iOS. The feature has to be turned on by the user and provides the option to encrypt the backup either with a password or a 64-digit encryption key.[227]\n\n\nThe application can store encrypted copies of the chat messages onto the SD card, but chat messages are also stored unencrypted in the SQLite database file \"msgstore.db\".[228]\n\n\n\n### WhatsApp Payments[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp Payments (marketed as *WhatsApp Pay*) is a peer-to-peer money transfer feature. The service became generally available in India and Brazil, and in Singapore for WhatsApp Business transactions only.[229][230]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2017, WhatsApp received permission from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to enter into partnership with multiple Indian banks,[231] for transactions over Unified Payments Interface (UPI),[232] which relies on mobile phone numbers to make account-to-account transfers.[233] In November 2020, UPI payments via WhatsApp were initially restricted to 20 million users,[234] and to 100 million users in April 2022,[235] and became generally available to everyone in August 2022.[236]\n\n\n\n### Facebook/WhatsApp cryptocurrency project, 2019\u20132022[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Diem (digital currency)\n\nOn February 28, 2019, *The New York Times* reported that Facebook was \"hoping to succeed where Bitcoin failed\" by developing an in-house cryptocurrency that would be incorporated into WhatsApp. The project reportedly involved more than 50 engineers under the direction of former PayPal president David A. Marcus. This 'Facebook coin' would reportedly be a stablecoin pegged to the value of a basket of different foreign currencies.[237]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Facebook said that the project would be named Libra, and that a digital wallet named \"Calibra\" was to be integrated into Facebook and WhatsApp.[238] After financial regulators in many regions raised concerns, Facebook stated that the currency, renamed Diem since December 2020, would require a government-issued ID for verification, and the wallet app would have fraud protection. Calibra was rebranded to Novi in May 2020.[239][240][241]\n\n\nMeta (formerly Facebook) ended its Novi project on September 1, 2022.[242][243]\n\n\n\n## Controversies and criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Misinformation[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp has repeatedly imposed limits on message forwarding in response to the spread of misinformation in countries including India and Australia. The measure, first introduced in 2018 to combat spam, was expanded and remained active in 2021. WhatsApp stated that the forwarding limits had helped to curb the spread of misinformation regarding COVID-19.[244][245][246]\n\n\n\n#### Murders in India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian WhatsApp lynchings\n\nSee also: WhatsApp University\n\nIn India, WhatsApp encouraged people to report messages that were fraudulent or incited violence after lynch mobs in India murdered innocent people because of malicious WhatsApp messages falsely accusing the victims of intending to abduct children.[247] There were a series of incidents between 2017 and 2020, after which WhatsApp announced changes for Indian users of the platform that labels forwarded messages as such.[248]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 elections in Brazil[edit]\n\n\nIn an investigation on the use of social media in politics, it was found that WhatsApp was being abused for the spread of fake news in the 2018 presidential elections in Brazil.[249] It was reported that US$3\u00a0million was spent in illegal concealed contributions related to this practice.[250]\n\n\nResearchers and journalists called on WhatsApp's parent company, Facebook, to adopt measures similar to those adopted in India and restrict the spread of hoaxes and fake news.[249]\n\n\n\n### Security and privacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reception and criticism of WhatsApp security and privacy features\n\nWhatsApp was initially criticized for its lack of encryption, sending information as plaintext.[251] Encryption was first added in May 2012.[252][253][254] End-to-end encryption was only fully implemented in April 2016 after a two-year process. As of September\u00a02021[update], it is known that WhatsApp makes extensive use of outside contractors and artificial intelligence systems to examine certain user messages, images and videos (those that have been flagged by users as possibly abusive); and turns over to law enforcement metadata including critical account and location information.[255]\n\n\nIn 2016, WhatsApp was widely praised for the addition of end-to-end encryption and earned a 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's \"Secure Messaging Scorecard\".[256] WhatsApp was criticized by security researchers and the Electronic Frontier Foundation for using backups that are not covered by end-to-end encryption and allow messages to be accessed by third-parties.[257][258]\n\n\nIn May 2019, a security vulnerability in WhatsApp was found and fixed that allowed a remote person to install spyware by making a call which did not need to be answered.[259][260]\n\n\nIn September 2019, WhatsApp was criticized for its implementation of a 'delete for everyone' feature. iOS users can elect to save media to their camera roll automatically. When a user deletes media for everyone, WhatsApp does not delete images saved in the iOS camera roll and so those users are able to keep the images. WhatsApp released a statement saying that \"the feature is working properly,\" and that images stored in the camera roll cannot be deleted due to Apple's security layers.[261]\n\n\nIn November 2019, WhatsApp released a new privacy feature that let users decide who can add them to groups.[262]\n\n\nIn December 2019, WhatsApp confirmed a security flaw that would allow hackers to use a malicious GIF image file to gain access to the recipient's data. When the recipient opened the gallery within WhatsApp, even if not sending the malicious image, the hack is triggered and the device and its contents become vulnerable. The flaw was patched and users were encouraged to update WhatsApp.[263][264][265]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2019, WhatsApp fixed a security flaw that allowed cyber attackers to repeatedly crash the messaging application for all members of group chat, which could only be fixed by forcing the complete uninstall and reinstall of the app.[266] The bug was discovered by Check Point in August 2019 and reported to WhatsApp. It was fixed in version 2.19.246 onwards.[267][268]\n\n\nFor security purposes, since February 1, 2020, WhatsApp has been made unavailable on smartphones using legacy operating systems like Android 2.3.7 or older and iPhone iOS 8 or older that are no longer updated by their providers.[269]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the NSO Group held its governmental clients accountable for the allegation of human rights abuses by WhatsApp. In its revelation via documents received from court, \nthe group claimed that the lawsuit brought against the company by WhatsApp threatened to infringe on its clients' \"national security and foreign policy concerns\". However, the company did not reveal names of the end users, which according to a research by Citizen Lab include, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates.[270]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2020, a claim that WhatsApp gave Google access to private messages was included in the anti-trust case against the latter. As the complaint was heavily redacted due to being an ongoing case, it did not disclose whether this was alleged tampering with the app's end-to-end encryption, or Google accessing user backups.[*clarification needed*][271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, WhatsApp announced an update to their Privacy Policy which stated that WhatsApp would share user data with Facebook and its \"family of companies\" beginning February 2021. Previously, users could opt-out of such data sharing, but the new policy removed this option. The new Privacy Policy would not apply within the EU, as it is illegal under the GDPR. Facebook and WhatsApp were widely criticized for this move.[122][123][272] The enforcement of the privacy policy was postponed from February 8 to May 15, 2021,[124][273] WhatsApp announced they had no plans to limit the functionality of the app for those who did not approve the new terms. WhatsApp do not limit the app: they simply insist it cannot be used without acceding.[126]\n\n\nOn October 15, 2021, WhatsApp announced that it would begin offering an end-to-end encryption service for chat backups, meaning no third party (including both WhatsApp and the cloud storage vendor) would have access to a user's information. This new encryption feature added an additional layer of protection to chat backups stored either on Apple iCloud or Google Drive.[274]\n\n\nOn November 29, 2021, an FBI document was uncovered by Rolling Stone, revealing that WhatsApp responds to warrants and subpoenas from law enforcement within minutes, providing user metadata to the authorities. The metadata includes the user's contact information and address book.[275]\n\n\nIn January 2022, an unsealed surveillance application revealed that WhatsApp started tracking seven users from China and Macau in November 2021, based on a request from US DEA investigators. The app collected data on who the users contacted and how often, and when and how they were using the app. This is reportedly not an isolated occurrence, as federal agencies can use the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to covertly track users without submitting any probable cause or linking a user's number to their identity.[276]\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, it was revealed that San Diego-based startup Boldend had developed tools to hack WhatsApp's encryption, gaining access to user data, at some point since the startup's inception in 2017. The vulnerability was reportedly patched in January 2021. Boldend is financed, in part, by Peter Thiel, a notable investor in Facebook.[277]\n\n\nIn September 2022, a critical security issue in WhatsApp's Android video call feature was reported. An integer overflow bug allowed a malicious user to take full control of the victim's application once a video call between two WhatsApp users was established. The issue was patched on the day it was officially reported.[278]\n\n\n\n#### UK institutions[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update] WhatsApp is widely used by government institutions in the UK, although such use is viewed as problematical since it hinders the public, including journalists, obtaining accurate government records when making freedom of information requests.[279]\n\n\nThe information commissioner has said that the use of WhatsApp posed risks for transparency since members of Parliament, government ministers, and officials who wished to avoid scrutiny might use WhatsApp despite there being official channels.[280] Transparency campaigners have challenged the practice in court.[281]\n\n\nNotably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government routinely made use of WhatsApp to make decisions on managing the crisis, including on personal rather than government issued devices. When the official inquiry into the pandemic began seeking evidence in May 2023 this presented issues for its ability to gather the material it sought. A personal device of the former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had been compromised by a security breach and it was claimed it could not be switched on in order to recover messages.[282] Further, the Cabinet Office had claimed that since many messages were not relevant to the inquiry, it only needed to hand over material it had \nselected as being relevant. The High Court, in a judicial review sought by the Cabinet Office, declared that all documents sought by the inquiry were to be handed over unredacted.[283]\n\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that around 500,000 National Health Service (NHS) staff used WhatsApp and other instant messaging systems at work and around 29,000 had faced disciplinary action for doing so. Higher usage was reported by frontline clinical staff to keep up with care needs, even though NHS trust policies do not permit their use.[284]\n\n\n\n#### Mods and fake versions[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, WhatsApp released a guide for users who had installed unofficial modified versions of WhatsApp and warned that it may ban those using unofficial clients.[285]\n\n\n\n#### WhatsApp snooping scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: WhatsApp snooping scandal\n\nIn May 2019, WhatsApp was attacked by hackers who installed spyware on a number of victims' smartphones.[286] The hack, allegedly developed by Israeli surveillance technology firm NSO Group, injected malware onto WhatsApp users' phones via a remote-exploit bug in the app's Voice over IP calling functions. A *Wired* report noted the attack was able to inject malware via calls to the targeted phone, even if the user did not answer the call.[287]\n\n\nOn October 29, WhatsApp filed a lawsuit against NSO Group in a San Francisco court, claiming that the alleged cyberattack violated US laws including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).[288] According to WhatsApp, the exploit \"targeted at least 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society\" among a total of 1,400 users in 20 countries.[289][290][291] On July 16, 2020, a US federal judge ruled that the lawsuit against NSO group could proceed. NSO Group filed a motion to have the lawsuit dismissed, but the judge denied all of its arguments.[292]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the NSO Group held its governmental clients accountable for the allegation of human rights abuses by WhatsApp. In its revelation via documents received via court, the group claimed that the lawsuit brought against the company by WhatsApp threatened to infringe on its clients' \"national security and foreign policy concerns\". However, the company did not reveal the names of the end users, which according to research by Citizen Lab include, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Jeff Bezos phone hack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jeff Bezos phone hacking incident\n\nIn January 2020, a digital forensic analysis revealed that the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos received an encrypted message on WhatsApp from the official account of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The message reportedly contained a malicious file, the receipt of which resulted in Bezos' phone being hacked. The United Nations' special rapporteur David Kaye and Agnes Callamard later confirmed that Jeff Bezos' phone was hacked through WhatsApp, as he was one of the targets of Saudi's hit list of individuals close to *The Washington Post* journalist Jamal Khashoggi.[294]\n\n\n\n#### FBI[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, an FBI document obtained by *Property of the People, Inc.*, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, through an FOIA request, reveals, that WhatsApp and iMessage are vulnerable to law-enforcement real-time searches.[295][296][297]\n\n\n\n#### Tek Fog[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, an investigation by *The Wire* found that BJP, an Indian political party allegedly used an app called Tek Fog which was capable of hacking inactive WhatsApp accounts en masse in order to mass message their contacts with propaganda. According to the Wire, a whistleblower with app access was able to hack a test WhatsApp account controlled by reporters \"within minutes.\"[298][299] Later, it was revealed to be a hoax news story for which *The Wire* also issued a formal apology to its readers.[300]\n\n\n\n### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2015, it was reported that a terrorists organization ISIS had been using WhatsApp to plot the November 2015 Paris attacks.[301] According to *The Independent*, ISIS also uses WhatsApp to traffic sex slaves.[302]\n\n\nIn March 2017, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd said encryption capabilities of messaging tools like WhatsApp are unacceptable, as news reported that Khalid Masood used the application several minutes before perpetrating the 2017 Westminster attack. Rudd publicly called for police and intelligence agencies to be given access to WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services to prevent future terror attacks.[303]\n\n\nIn April 2017, the perpetrator of the Stockholm truck attack reportedly used WhatsApp to exchange messages with an ISIS supporter shortly before and after the incident. The messages involved discussing how to make an explosive device and a confession to the attack.[304]\n\n\nIn April 2017, nearly 300 WhatsApp groups with about 250 members each were reportedly being used to mobilize stone-pelters in Jammu and Kashmir to disrupt security forces' operations at encounter sites. According to police, 90% of these groups were closed down after police contacted their admins.[305] Further, after a six-month probe which involved the infiltration of 79 WhatsApp groups, the National Investigation Agency reported that out of about 6386 members and admins of these groups, about 1000 were residents of Pakistan and gulf nations. Further, for their help in negating anti-terror operations, the Indian stone pelters were getting funded through barter trade from Pakistan and other indirect means.[306]\n\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI stated that an ISIS sympathizer, who was plotting to assassinate George W. Bush, was arrested based on his WhatsApp data. According to the arrest warrant for the suspect, his WhatsApp account was placed under surveillance.[307]\n\n\n\n### Scams and malware[edit]\n\n\nThere are numerous ongoing scams on WhatsApp that let hackers spread viruses or malware.[308] In May 2016, some WhatsApp users were reported to have been tricked into downloading a third-party application called *WhatsApp Gold*, which was part of a scam that infected the users' phones with malware.[309] A message that promises to allow access to their WhatsApp friends' conversations, or their contact lists, has become the most popular hit against anyone who uses the application in Brazil. Clicking on the message actually sends paid text messages. Since December 2016, more than 1.5\u00a0million people have clicked and lost money.[310]\n\n\nAnother application called *GB WhatsApp* is considered malicious by cybersecurity firm Symantec because it usually performs some unauthorized operations on end-user devices.[311]\n\n\n\n### Bans[edit]\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp is owned by Meta, whose main social media service Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009.[312] In September 2017, security researchers reported to *The New York Times* that the WhatsApp service had been completely blocked in China.[313][314]\n\n\n\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nOn May 9, 2014, the government of Iran announced that it had proposed to block the access to WhatsApp service to Iranian residents. \"The reason for this is the assumption of WhatsApp by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is an American Zionist,\" said Abdolsamad Khorramabadi, head of the country's Committee on Internet Crimes. Subsequently, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani issued an order to the Ministry of ICT to stop filtering WhatsApp.[315][316] It was blocked permanently until Meta answers September 2022.[317]\n\n\n\n#### Turkey[edit]\n\n\nTurkey temporarily banned WhatsApp in 2016, following the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.[318]\n\n\n\n#### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Diego Dzodan, Facebook's vice-president for Latin America was arrested in Brazil for not cooperating with an investigation in which WhatsApp conversations were requested.[319] On March 2, 2016, at dawn the next day, Dzodan was released because the Court of Appeal held that the arrest was disproportionate and unreasonable.[320]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2016, mobile providers in Brazil were ordered to block WhatsApp for 72 hours for the service's second failure to cooperate with criminal court orders.[321] Once again, the block was lifted following an appeal, after less than 24 hours.[322]\n\n\nBrazil's Central Bank issued an order to payment card companies Visa and Mastercard on June 23, 2020, to stop working with WhatsApp on its new electronic payment system. A statement from the Bank asserted the decision to block the Facebook-owned company's latest offering was taken in order to \"preserve an adequate competitive environment\" in the mobile payments space and to ensure \"functioning of a payment system that's interchangeable, fast, secure, transparent, open and cheap.\"[323][324]\n\n\n\n#### Uganda[edit]\n\n\nThe government of Uganda banned WhatsApp and Facebook, along with other social media platforms, to enforce a tax on the use of social media.[325] Users are to be charged USh.200/= per day to access these services according to the new law set by parliament.[326]\n\n\n\n#### United Arab Emirates (UAE)[edit]\n\n\nThe United Arab Emirates banned WhatsApp video chat and VoIP call applications[327][328] in as early as 2013[329] due to what is often reported as an effort to protect the commercial interests of their home grown nationally owned telecom providers (du and Etisalat).[329] Their app ToTok has received press suggesting it is able to spy on users.[328][330]\n\n\n\n#### Cuba[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including WhatsApp, to curb the spread of information during the anti-government protests.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Switzerland[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2021, the Swiss army banned the use of WhatsApp and several other non-Swiss encrypted messaging services by army personnel. The ban was prompted by concerns of US authorities potentially accessing user data for such apps because of the CLOUD Act. The army recommended that all army personnel use Threema instead, as the service is based in Switzerland.[332]\n\n\n\n#### Zambia[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, the digital rights organization Access Now reported that WhatsApp along with several other social media apps was being blocked in Zambia for the duration of the general election. The organization reported a massive drop-off in traffic for the blocked services, though the country's government made no official statements about the block.[333]\n\n\n\n#### Third-party clients[edit]\n\n\nIn mid-2013, WhatsApp Inc. filed for the DMCA takedown of the discussion thread on the XDA Developers forums about the then popular third-party client \"WhatsApp Plus\".[334]\n\n\nIn 2015, some third-party WhatsApp clients that were reverse-engineering the WhatsApp mobile app, received a cease and desist to stop activities that were violating WhatsApp legal terms. As a result, users of third-party WhatsApp clients were also banned.[335]\n\n\n\n## WhatsApp Business[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp launched two business-oriented apps in January 2018,[336] separated by the intended userbase:\n\n\n\n* A **WhatsApp Business app** for small companies[337]\n* An **Enterprise Solution** for bigger companies with global customer bases, such as airlines, e-commerce retailers and banks, who would be able to offer customer service and conversational commerce (e-commerce) via WhatsApp chat, using live agents or chatbots (as far back as 2015, companies like Meteordesk[338] had provided unofficial solutions for enterprises to attend to large numbers of users, but these were shut down by WhatsApp)\n\n\nIn October 2020, Facebook announced the introduction of pricing tiers for services offered via the WhatsApp Business API, charged on a per-message basis.[339][340]\n\n\n\n## User statistics[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp handled ten billion messages per day in August 2012,[341] growing from two billion in April 2012,[342] and one billion the previous October.[343] On June 13, 2013, WhatsApp announced that they had reached their new daily record by processing 27\u00a0billion messages.[344] According to the *Financial Times*, WhatsApp \"has done to SMS on mobile phones what Skype did to international calling on landlines\".[345]\n\n\nBy April 22, 2014, WhatsApp had over 500\u00a0million monthly active users, 700\u00a0million photos and 100\u00a0million videos were being shared daily, and the messaging system was handling more than 10\u00a0billion messages each day.[346][347]\n\n\nOn August 24, 2014, Koum announced on his Twitter account that WhatsApp had over 600\u00a0million active users worldwide. At that point WhatsApp was adding about 25\u00a0million new users every month, or 833,000 active users per day.[86][348]\n\n\nIn May 2017, it was reported that WhatsApp users spend over 340\u00a0million minutes on video calls each day on the app. This is the equivalent of roughly 646 years of video calls per day.[349]\n\n\nBy February 2017, WhatsApp had over 1.2\u00a0billion users globally,[350] reaching 1.5\u00a0billion monthly active users by the end of 2017.[351]\n\n\nIn January 2020, WhatsApp reached over 5\u00a0billion installs on Google Play Store making it only the second non-Google app to achieve this milestone.[352]\n\n\nAs of February 2020, WhatsApp had over 2\u00a0billion users globally.[353][354]\n\n\n\n### Specific markets[edit]\n\n\nIndia is by far WhatsApp's largest market in terms of total number of users. In May 2014, WhatsApp crossed 50\u00a0million monthly active users in India, which is also its largest country by the number of monthly active users,[355] then 70\u00a0million in October 2014, making users in India 10% of WhatsApp's total user base.[356] In February 2017, WhatsApp reached 200\u00a0million monthly active users in India.[357]\n\n\nIsrael is one of WhatsApp's strongest markets in terms of ubiquitous usage. According to *Globes*, already by 2013 the application was installed on 92% of all smartphones, with 86% of users reporting daily use.[358]\n\n\n\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp competes with a number of messaging services. They include services like iMessage (estimated 1.3\u00a0billion active users[359]), WeChat (1.26\u00a0billion active users[360][361]), Telegram (700\u00a0million users[362]), Viber (260\u00a0million active users[363]), LINE (217\u00a0million active users[364]), KakaoTalk (57 million active users[365]), and Signal (40\u00a0million active users[366]). Both Telegram and Signal in particular were reported to get registration spikes during WhatsApp outages and controversies.[367][368][369]\n\n\nWhatsApp has increasingly drawn its innovation from competing services,[370] such as a Telegram-inspired web version[371] and features for groups.[372] In 2016, WhatsApp was accused of copying features from a then-unreleased version of iMessage.[373]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Comparison of cross-platform instant messaging clients\n* Comparison of user features of messaging platforms\n* Comparison of VoIP software\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Instagram\n* List of most-downloaded Google Play applications\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Horwitz, Jeff (February 12, 2020). \"As WhatsApp Tops 2 Billion Users, Its Boss Vows to Defend Encryption\". *Wall Street Journal*.

It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[11]\n\n\nInstagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature\u2014similar to its main competitor Snapchat\u2014which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500\u00a0million people daily.[11]\n\n\n\nOriginally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10\u00a0million in a year, and 1\u00a0billion by June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1\u00a0billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October\u00a02015[update], over 40\u00a0billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Instagram.\n\n![](image)Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as **Burbn**, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[12][13] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users.[14][15] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[16]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132011: Beginnings and major funding[edit]\n\n\nJosh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[17] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[17] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[17][18]\n\n\nThe first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26\u00a0p.m. on July\u00a016, 2010.[19][15] Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later at 9:24\u00a0p.m. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[20][21][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] On October\u00a06, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store. In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7\u00a0million (equivalent to $9,357,057 in 2023) in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[22] The deal valued Instagram at around $20\u00a0million. In April 2012, Instagram raised $50\u00a0million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) from venture capitalists with a valuation of $500\u00a0million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in 2023).[23] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[24]\n\n\n\n### 2012\u20132014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook[edit]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[25][26] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[27] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[28][29] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600\u00a0million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\".On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1\u00a0billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock ,[30][31][32] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[33][34][35] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[36] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[37] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300\u00a0million in cash and 23\u00a0million shares of stock.[38]\n\n\nThe deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[35] The deal price was compared to the $35\u00a0million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[35] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was \"committed to building and growing Instagram independently.\"[35] According to *Wired*, the deal netted Systrom $400\u00a0million.[39]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality,[40] as well as a selection of *badges*, and web widget buttons to link to profiles.[41]\n\n\nSince the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2015\u20132017: Redesign and Windows app[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Instagram headquarters in Menlo Park\nIn June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.[44][45][46] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The *slideshow banner*[47][48] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform.[49][50] The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone 8.[51][52][53] The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages.[54] Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016.[55][56] In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a \"lightweight\" version of the Explore tab.[57][58]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, \"modern\" and colorful icon.[59][60][61] Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when *The Verge* received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.[62]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments on a post.[63][64][65]\n\n\nThe mobile website allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the ability to upload videos were not introduced then.[66][67]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020.\n\n\n\n### 2018\u20132019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes[edit]\n\n\nTo comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018.[68][69][70]\n\n\nIGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application. The application was shut down and removed from app stores in March 2022, citing low usage and a shift to short-form video content.[71]\n\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram.[72][73] On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram.[74][75][76]\n\n\nDuring Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly displayed \"like\" counts for content posted by other users.[77] Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users \"worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about.\"[78][79] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in users.[79][77] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July.[79][80] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019.[81] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.[82]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the \"Following\" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were \"surprised\" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[83][84]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts visible in page scrolling mode unless logged in. Until this point, public profiles had been available to all users, even when not logged in. Following the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up requires the user to log in to continue viewing content.[85][86][87]\n\n\nThat month, Instagram launched a separate app known as Threads. Similar to Snapchat, the app allowed users to communicate through messaging and video chats.[88] It was integrated with Instagram's \"Close friends\" feature, so that users could send images, photos, and texts privately to others, and also had Instagram's photo editing system embedded into the app.[89][90] However, Instagram discontinued this version of Threads in December 2021,[91] mainly due to most of its features being rolled out on Instagram itself, as well as low usage compared to other social media applications.[92] Threads was not well-received among Instagram's user base. Since its launch, only approximately 220,000 users globally downloaded the app, which represented less than 0.1% of Instagram's monthly active users, indicating a lack of success in driving adoption.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present: New features[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[94]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called \"Reels\".[95][96][97] The intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok.[97][98][95] Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow.[99]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok.[100] The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories.[101]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Instagram launched a new feature in which four people can go live at once.[102] Instagram also announced that adults would not be allowed to message teens who don't follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105][106]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram began allowing users in some regions to add pronouns to their profile page.[107][108]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2021, Meta services suffered their worst outage since 2008, bringing down Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.[109][110] Security experts identified the problem as possibly being DNS-related.[111]\n\n\nOn March 17, 2022, Zuckerberg confirmed plans to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the platform. In September 2022, Ireland's Data Protection Commission fined the company $402 million under privacy laws recently adopted by the European Union over how it handled the privacy data of minors.[112][113][114]\n\n\nAfter being trialled in mid-2022,[115] Instagram introduced Notes in December 2022. This feature allows users to share updates as short text posts of up to 60 characters with certain people, who can then reply to them using messaging on Instagram.[116][117]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Instagram introduced a new feature allowing users to browse and post GIFs in their comments.[118] That same month, Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.[119]\n\n\nOn July 5, 2023, Meta launched Threads, a social network platform connected to Instagram that allows users to make public shortform blog posts comprising text, photos, and videos, as well as to converse with other users and reblog other users' posts. Threads aims to compete with Twitter.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Instagram began testing the removal of the ability to see \"recent\" posts from various hashtags.[123] This change became permanent and system wide a year later, and now hashtags can only be used to see a selection of curated content from \"top\" users.[124] These changes are ostensibly an attempt to hinder the spread of misinformation, while Instagram has also repeatedly stated that hashtags do not help posts get views.[125]\n\n\n\n## Features and tools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An original photograph (left) is automatically cropped to a square by Instagram, and has a filter added at the selection of the user (right).\n![](image)A photo collage of an unprocessed image (top left) modified with the 16 different Instagram filters available in 2011\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds,[126] and geotag images with the name of a location.[127] Users can set their account as \"private\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests.[128] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites.[129] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt\u2013shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon.[130][131] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well.[132][133][134] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.[135][136]\n\n\nSince December 2016, posts can be \"saved\" into a private area of the app.[137][138] The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections.[139][140] Users can also \"archive\" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of \"likes\" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the \"emergent behavior\" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.[141][142] In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies.[143][144]\n\n\nSince February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel.[145][146] The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead.[147][148]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called \"focus mode,\" which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.[149] In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.[150]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2021, Instagram launched a new feature named Instagram Live \"Rooms\" Let Four People Go Live Together.[151]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Instagram announced a new accessibility feature for videos on Instagram Reels and Stories to allow creators to place closed captions on their content.[152]\n\n\n\n### Hashtags[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other.[153][154] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \"photo\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.[155]\n\n\nUsers on Instagram have created \"trends\" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.[156][157]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.[158][159] The ability to search \"Recent\" hashtags was temporarily disabled during the 2020 US elections, to prevent the spread of misinformation.[160] In 2022 this was again tested on some users, and in April 2023 the ability to search recent hashtags was removed entirely. Now, users are only able to see a curated selection of \"popular\" posts using a given hashtag. Instagram states that this is to prevent abuse and that hashtags do not help users gain views, but it has been noted that using hashtags is the only free method for a user to reach past their existing followers.[161]\n\n\n\n### Explore[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \"Explore\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search.[162] The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations.[163] In April 2016, Instagram added a \"Videos You Might Like\" channel to the tab,[164][165] followed by an \"Events\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events,[166][167] followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October.[168][169] The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically curated page of the \"best\" Instagram Live videos currently airing.[170] In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.[171]\n\n\n\n### Photographic filters[edit]\n\n\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a \"Lux\" filter, an effect that \"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\".[172][173] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.[174]\n\n\n\n### Video[edit]\n\n\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013.[175][176] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine.[177][178] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos.[179][180] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds.[181][182] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.[145][146][183]\n\n\n\n#### IGTV[edit]\n\n\nMain article: IGTV\n\nIGTV is a vertical video\u00a0application launched by Instagram[184] in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650\u00a0MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB.[185] The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video.[186][187][188] In March 2022, the application was shut down.[71]\n\n\n\n#### Reels[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as \"Reels\" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards.[189] It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts.[190] Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature.[191] Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools.[185]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country.[192] The following month, Reels officially launched in 50 countries including the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.[193] Instagram has recently introduced a reel button on home page.[194]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2021, Instagram launched full-screen advertisements in Reels. The ads are similar to regular reels and can run up to 30 seconds. They are distinguished from regular content by the \"sponsored\" tag under the account name.[195]\n\n\nDespite the \"TikTokification\" of Reels and the parent company Meta spending millions on courting content creators, user engagement continued to lag far behind TikTok as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Direct[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people.[197][198][199] The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation.[200][201][202] A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.[203][204]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads.[205][206][207] In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.[208][209]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website, allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology.[210]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon.[211]\n\n\nIn March 2021, a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under 18 who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Instagram Stories[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat.[212][213] In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told *Recode* that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", *Recode* wrote that \"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\". Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\"[214][215]\n\n\nIn November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending.[216][170]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories.[217][218][219]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a \"clone\" of Snapchat's functionality.[220][221][219]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces.[222][223]\n\n\nLater in May, *TechCrunch* reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page.[224] A few days later, Instagram announced \"Story Search\", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term.[171][225]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately.[226] In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags.[227][228]\n\n\nStories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.[229][230]\n\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Instagram introduced \"Story Highlights\",[231] also known as \"Permanent Stories\", which are similar to Instagram Stories, but don't expire. They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well.\n\n\nIn June 2018, the daily active story users of Instagram had reached 400\u00a0million users, and monthly active users had reached 1\u00a0billion active users.[232]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\nEmily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013.[233][234] She stated in an interview with *The Wall Street Journal* in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company.[235] White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat.[236][237] In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new \"monetization products\", according to a spokesperson.[238]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram announced that video and image ads would soon appear in feeds for users in the United States,[239][240] with the first image advertisements displaying on November 1, 2013.[241][242] Video ads followed nearly a year later on October 30, 2014.[243][244] In June 2014, Instagram announced the rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia,[245] with ads starting to roll out that autumn.[246]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Instagram announced it would implement \"carousel ads,\" allowing advertisers to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content.[247][248] The company launched carousel image ads in October 2015,[249][250] and video carousel ads in March 2016.[251]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000\u00a0advertisers on the platform.[252] This number increased to 500,000 by September 2016,[253] and 1\u00a0million in March 2017.[254][255]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Instagram launched new tools for business accounts, including business profiles, analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads. To access the tools, businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page.[256] The new analytics page, known as Instagram Insights, allowed business accounts to view top posts, reach, impressions, engagement and demographic data.[256] Insights rolled out first in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and expanded to the rest of the world later in 2016.[257][256][258]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a \"shopping list.\"[259] In April 2019, Instagram added the option to \"Checkout on Instagram,\" which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app.[260]\n\n\nIn March 2020, via a blog post, Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation, hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID-19 on its platform, \"We'll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers.\"[261]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Instagram launched a native affiliate marketing tool creators can use to earn commissions based on sales. Commission-enabled posts are labeled \"Eligible for Commission\" on the user side to identify them as affiliate posts. Launch partners included Sephora, MAC, and Kopari.[262]\n\n\n\n### Stand-alone apps[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released **Bolt**, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen.[263][264] It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos.[265][266] Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date.[267] In October 2015, it released **Boomerang**, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.[268][269]\n\n\n\n### Third-party services[edit]\n\n\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads).[270][271]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Instagram announced that effective June 1, 2016, it would end \"feed\" API access to its platform in order to \"maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers\" and \"set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform\", including those oriented towards content creation, publishers, and advertisers. Additionally, third-party clients have been prohibited from using the text strings \"insta\" or \"gram\" in their name.[272] It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third-party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience (due to increasing monetization of the service), and security reasons (such as preventing abuse by automated click farms, and the hijacking of accounts). In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in 2018.[271][273][274]\n\n\nFor unlimited browsing of public Instagram profiles without having to create an account, as well as for anonymous browsing of someone else's Stories, has to use the Instagram profiles viewer.[275] Stories are more authentic than typical photos posted as posts because users know that in 24 hours their Stories will disappear if they don't add them as highlighted[276] (however users can check who saw their Story for 48 hours after it was published[277]). For this reason, they are very valuable for market research.[278]\n\n\n\n### Fact checking[edit]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact checking programs towards Instagram,[279] by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.[280]\n\n\n\n### Algorithm and design changes[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm.[281] Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked,[282] but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates.[283][284][285] The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down,[286] nor provide a way to change it back, which they re-affirmed in 2020.[287][288] However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order.[289] He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below.[290]\n\n\nSince 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts (\"shadowbanning\") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Instagram wrote that \"When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags\".[291][292] Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.[293]\n\n\nInstagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December 2018 update.[294][295][296][297][298][*excessive citations*] They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy-back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll, by swiping left.[299] Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug, or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience.[297][296]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new \"Shop\" tab, moving the activity feed to the top. The \"new post\" button was also relocated to the top and replaced with a Reels tab[300] The company states that \"the Shop tab gives you a better way to connect with brands and creators and discover products you love\" and the Reels tab \"makes it easier for you to discover short, fun videos from creators all over the world and people just like you.\"[301] However, users have not responded well to the change, taking their complaints to Twitter and Reddit, and *The New York Times* has shunned Reels in particular, saying \"Not only does Reels fail in every way as a TikTok clone, but it\u2019s confusing, frustrating and impossible to navigate\".[302]\n\n\nAlso in 2020, Instagram rolled out a feature titled \"suggested posts\", which adds posts from accounts Instagram thinks a user would like to such user's feed.[303] The feature was met with controversy from both Reddit users[304] from *The Verge*, which reported that suggested posts would keep users glued to their feed, give Instagram more advertising space, and ultimately harm the mental health of users, while Instagram executive Julian Gutman rebutted, stating the feature was not intended to keep users glued to their screens.[305] Suggested posts received more controversy after Fast Company stated that the feature would be impossible to turn off.[306]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2021, Instagram announced a test change to the \"suggested posts\" feature. The company will put suggested posts ahead of posts from people who the user is following in the Instagram feed, citing positive reception as the reason for this change.[307]\n\n\n\n## Scientific studies[edit]\n\n\n### Harmful effect on teenage girls' mental health[edit]\n\n\nFacebook has known for years that its Instagram app is harmful to a large number of teenagers, according to research seen by *The Wall Street Journal*, but the company concealed the knowledge from lawmakers.[308] The internal Facebook presentations seen by the *Journal* in 2021 show that Instagram is toxic to a sizable percentage of its users, particularly teenage girls. More than 40% of Instagram's users are under 23 years old. The presentations were seen by the company's executives and the findings mentioned to Mark Zuckerberg in 2020, but when asked in March 2021 about Instagram's effect on young people, Zuckerberg defended the company's plan to launch an Instagram product for children under 13.[308] When asked by senators for its internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health, Facebook sent a six-page letter that did not include the company's research. The company told Forbes that its research is \"kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.\"[309] In a blog post, Instagram said that the WSJ story \"focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light.\"[310] On September 27, 2021, weeks after the WSJ report was released, Facebook announced that it had \"paused\" development of Instagram Kids, the Instagram product aimed at children. The company stated it was looking into concerns raised by the regulators and parents. Adam Mosseri stated that the company would return to the project as \"[t]he reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.\"[311][312] Based on Facebook's leaked internal research, Instagram has had negative effects on the body image of one in three teenagers.[313] Leaked internal documents also indicate that two thirds of teen girls and 40 percent of teen boys experience negative social comparison, and that Instagram makes 20 percent of the teens feel worse about themselves. According to the leaked research, Instagram has higher impact on appearance comparison than TikTok or Snapchat.[314] 13 percent of British, and 6 percent of US, teenager users with suicidal thoughts could trace them to Instagram use.[313]\n\n\n\n### Depression, anxiety and stress[edit]\n\n\nKhodarahimi and Fathi found evidence that Instagram users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non-users.[315] However, Frison & Eggermont 2017 found that, among both boys and girls, browsing could predict the presence of depressive symptoms; liking and posting seemed to have no effect.[316] In addition, their study showed that the presence of depressive symptoms in a given user could positively predict that they would make posts.[316] The study showed that the viewing of celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women more negative.[316][317] In a 2021 study, Mun & Kim pointed out that Instagram users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves on their Instagram accounts, which in turn increased the likelihood of depression. However, depression was mitigated by the users' perception of their own popularity.[318]\n\n\nLub & Trub 2015 showed that following more strangers increases social comparisons and depressive symptoms.[319] Multiple studies have found that increasing time spent on Instagram increases social anxiety and anxiety related to personal traits, physical appearance, and high-stress body areas in particular.[320][321][322] Sherlock & Wagstaff 2019 showed that both the number of followers and followees can slightly increase anxiety over personal traits.[323] Additionally, Moujaes & Verrier 2020 observed a connection between online engagement with mothering-based influencers known as InstaMums and anxiety.[324] However, Mackson et al. 2019 suggested beneficial effects of Instagram use on anxiety symptoms.[325][324]\n\n\n\n### Body image[edit]\n\n\nInstagram users report higher body surveillance (the habitual monitoring of one's body shape and size),[326] appearance-related pressure,[327] eating-disorder-related-pathology[328] and lower body satisfaction[328] than non-users. Multiple studies have also shown that users who take more selfies before making a post, and those who strategically present themselves by participating in such activities as editing or manipulating selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction, and lower body esteem overall.[329][330][331][332] Tiggermann et al. showed that facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies for Instagram. Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one's body.[333][334][335][336]\n\n\n\n### Loneliness and social exclusion[edit]\n\n\nMackson et al. 2019 found that Instagram users were less lonely than non-users[325] and that Instagram membership predicts lower self-reported loneliness.[332] A 2021 study by B\u00fcttner & Rudertb also showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism, especially for those with higher needs to belong.[337] However, Brailovskaia & Margraf 2018 found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion, life satisfaction, and social support. Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self-conscientiousness.[338] Fioravanti et al. 2020 showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual pattern of Instagram use. The effects seemed to be specific for women, where no significant differences were observed for men.[339] The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out, or FOMO, has been confirmed in multiple studies.[340][341] Research shows that Instagram browsing predicts social comparison, which generates FOMO, which can ultimately lead to depression.[342]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol and drug use[edit]\n\n\nThere is a small positive correlation between the intensity of one's Instagram usage and alcohol consumption, with binge drinkers reporting greater intensity of Instagram use than non-binge drinkers.[343] Boyle et al. 2016 found a small to moderate positive relationship between alcohol consumption, enhanced drinking motives, and drinking behavior during college and Instagram usage,[344]\n\n\n\n### Eating disorders[edit]\n\n\nA comparison of Instagram users with non-users showed that boys with an Instagram account differ from boys without an account in terms of over-evaluation of their shape and weight, skipping meals, and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions. Girls with an Instagram account only differed from girls without an account in terms of skipping meals; they also had a stricter exercise schedule, a pattern not found in boys. This suggests a possible negative effect of Instagram usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for both boys and girls.[332][345] Several studies identified a small positive relationship between time spent on Instagram and both internalization of beauty or muscular ideals and self-objectification.[332][346][347][348] Both Appel et al. 2016 and Feltman et al. 2017 found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use and both body surveillance and dietary behaviors or disordered eating.[349][348]\n\n\n\n### Suicide and self-harm[edit]\n\n\nPicardo et al. 2020 examined the relationship between self-harm posts and actual self-harm behaviours offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users. The study also reported preliminary evidence of the online posts affecting offline behavior, but stopped short of claiming causality. At the same time, some benefits for those who engage with self-harm content online have been suggested.[350] Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support.[351]\n\n\n\n### Sharenting risks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sharenting\n\nSharenting is when parents post content online, including images, about their children. Instagram is one of the most popular social media channels for sharenting. The hashtag #letthembelittle contains over 10 million images related to children on Instagram. Bare 2020 analysed 300 randomly selected, publicly available images under the hashtag and found that the corresponding images tended to contain children's personal information, including name, age and location.[352]\n\n\n\n### Instagram addiction[edit]\n\n\nSanz-Blas et al. 2019 showed that users who feel that they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of \"addiction\" to Instagram, which in turn was related to higher self-reported levels of stress induced by the app.[353] In a study focusing on the relationship between various psychological needs and \"addiction\" to Instagram by students, Foroughi et al. 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of students' addiction to Instagram. In addition, the study proved that addiction to Instagram negatively affected academic performance.[354] Additionally, Gezgin & Mihci 2020 found that frequent Instagram usage correlated with smartphone addiction.[355]\n\n\n\n## User characteristics and behavior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Instagram app, running on the Android operating system\n### Users[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of most-followed Instagram accounts\n\nFollowing the release in October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010.[356][357] In June 2011, it announced that it had 5\u00a0million users,[358] which increased to 10\u00a0million in September.[359][360] This growth continued to 30\u00a0million users in April 2012,[359][25] 80\u00a0million in July 2012,[361][362] 100\u00a0million in February 2013,[363][364] 130\u00a0million in June 2013,[365] 150\u00a0million in September 2013,[366][367] 300\u00a0million in December 2014,[368][369] 400\u00a0million in September 2015,[370][371] 500\u00a0million in June 2016,[372][373] 600\u00a0million in December 2016,[374][375] 700\u00a0million in April 2017,[376][377] and 800\u00a0million in September 2017.[378][379]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Instagram passed 100\u00a0million photos uploaded to the service.[380][381] This grew to 150\u00a0million in August 2011,[382][383] and by June 2013, there were over 16\u00a0billion photos on the service.[365] In October 2015, there existed over 40\u00a0billion photos.[384]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Instagram Stories reached 100\u00a0million active users, two months after launch.[385][386] This increased to 150\u00a0million in January 2017,[217][218] 200\u00a0million in April, surpassing Snapchat's user growth,[220][221][219] and 250\u00a0million active users in June 2017.[387][226]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Instagram Direct had 375\u00a0million monthly users.[205][206][207]\n\n\n\n#### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], Instagram's users are divided equally with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female while 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation with 90% of the 150\u00a0million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000, and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so.[388] With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram with 23%. Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15%. Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day.[389]\n\n\n\n### User behavior[edit]\n\n\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show peoples' faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement.[390] Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and also are more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content.[391] Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge; however, this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick.[392]\n\n\nThe motives for using Instagram among young people are mainly to look at posts, particularly for the sake of social interactions and recreation. In contrast, the level of agreement expressed in creating Instagram posts was lower, which demonstrates that Instagram's emphasis on visual communication is widely accepted by young people in social communication.[393]\n\n\n\n### Performative activism[edit]\n\n\nStarting in June 2020, Instagram was more widely used as a platform for social justice movements including the Black Lives Matter movement.[394][395] This has changed how people address activism, created a lack of consistency in protest, and is not widely accepted.[396][397] Most notably in 2020, Shirien Damra shared an illustration and tribute she made of George Floyd after his death, and it resulted in more than 3.4 million \"likes\", followed by many offline reproductions of the illustration.[398][399] Instagram-based activism (as well as other social media) has been criticized and dismissed for being performative, reductionist, and overly focused on aesthetics.[396]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 *TechCrunch* Crunchies in January 2011.[400] In May 2011, *Fast Company* listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\".[401] In June 2011, *Inc.* included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list.[12]\n\n\nInstagram won \"Best Locally Made App\" in the *SF Weekly* Web Awards in September 2011.[402] *7x7Magazine'*s September 2011 issue featured Systrom and Krieger on the cover of their \"The Hot 20 2011\" issue.[403] In December 2011, Apple Inc. named Instagram the \"App of the Year\" for 2011.[404] In 2015, Instagram was named No. 1 by Mashable on its list of \"The 100 best iPhone apps of all time,\" noting Instagram as \"one of the most influential social networks in the world.\"[405] Instagram was listed among *Time*'s \"50 Best Android Applications for 2013\" list.[406]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social media and suicide\n\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14\u201324, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\". Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\".[407][408] The company filters out the reviews and accounts. If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them.[409]\n\n\nIn 2017, researchers from Harvard University and University of Vermont demonstrated a machine learning tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds.[410]\n\n\nIn 2019, Instagram began to test the hiding of like counts for posts made by its users, with the feature later made available to everyone.\n\n\nCorrelations have been made between Instagram content and dissatisfaction with one's body, as a result of people comparing themselves to other users. In a recent survey half of the applicants admitted to photo editing behavior which has been linked with concerns over body image.[411]\n\n\nIn October 2021, CNN published an article and interviews on two young women, Ashlee Thomas and Anastasia Vlasova, saying Instagram endangered their lives due to it having toxic effects on their diets.[412]\n\n\nIn October, 2023, 42 states from the USA filed a lawsuit against Instagram and parent company Meta, accusing them of contributing to a youth mental health crisis due to the addictive nature of the platforms. The lawsuit claims that Meta and its Instagram unit repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and knowingly induced young children and teenagers into addictive and compulsive social media use. Meta representatives replied that they were disappointed with the lawsuit and were hoping instead to continue working with other companies from the industry to create new and better standards for applications teens use.[413][414]\n\n\n\n#### Negative comments[edit]\n\n\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up.[415][416] After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities,[417] followed by regular users in September.[418] In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers.[419][420]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Instagram announced that it would automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and \"spammy\" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed deep learning algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes natural-language processing techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords.[421][422][409]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages.[423][424]\n\n\nIn July 2019, the service announced that it would introduce a system to proactively detect problematic comments and encourage the user to reconsider their comment, as well as allowing users the ability to \"restrict\" others' abilities to communicate with them, citing that younger users felt the existing block system was too much of an escalation.[82]\n\n\nAn April 2022 study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Instagram failed to act on 90% of abusive direct messages (DMs) sent to five high-profile women, despite the DMs being reported to moderators. The participants of the study included actress Amber Heard, journalist Bryony Gordon, television presenter Rachel Riley, activist Jamie Klingler and magazine founder Sharan Dhaliwal. Instagram disputed many of the study's conclusions.[425][426][427]\n\n\n\n### Culture[edit]\n\n\nOn August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \"Anything Could Happen.\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted.[428]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \"one or more individuals\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez. The company said in a statement that it had \"fixed the bug swiftly\" and was running an investigation.[429][430] However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \"millions\" rather than the previously assumed limitation on verified accounts. Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search.[431] *The Daily Beast* was provided with a sample of the affected accounts, and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources.[432] *The Verge* wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes,[431] and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The company admitted that \"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\", but believed that \"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\", though *TechCrunch* stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\".[433]\n\n\nIn 2019, Apple pulled an app that let users stalk people on Instagram by scraping accounts and collecting data.[434]\n\n\nIran has DPI blocking for Instagram.[435]\n\n\n\n### Content ownership[edit]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence:[436]\n\n\n\n\n> To help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.\n> \n> \n\n\nThere was no option for users to opt out of the changed Terms of Service without deleting their accounts before the new policy went into effect on January 16, 2013.[437] The move garnered severe criticism from users,[438][439] prompting Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to write a blog post one day later, announcing that they would \"remove\" the offending language from the policy. Citing misinterpretations about its intention to \"communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram\", Systrom also stated that it was \"our mistake that this language is confusing\" and that \"it is not our intention to sell your photos\". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on \"updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear\".[440][438]\n\n\nThe policy change and its backlash caused competing photo services to use the opportunity to \"try to lure users away\" by promoting their privacy-friendly services,[441] and some services experienced substantial gains in momentum and user growth following the news.[442] On December 20, Instagram announced that the advertising section of the policy would be reverted to its original October 2010 version.[443] *The Verge* wrote about that policy as well, however, noting that the original policy gives the company right to \"place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content\", meaning that \"Instagram has always had the right to use your photos in ads, almost any way it wants. We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched\".[436]\n\n\nThe policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified.[444]\n\n\n\n### Facebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony.[445] On February 26, 2019, the *New York Post* released an article stating that the FTC had discovered a memo authored by a senior Facebook official, revealing that the purpose behind the acquisition of Instagram was to remove a potential rival. Wu explains this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly). Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO. The article reported that the FTC \"has formed a task force to review \"anticompetitive conduct\" in the tech world amid concerns that tech companies are growing too powerful. The task force will look at \"the full panoply of remedies\" if it finds \"competitive harm,\" FTC competition bureau director Bruce Hoffman told reporters.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Algorithmic advertisement with a rape threat[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for *The Guardian*, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told *The Guardian* that \"We are sorry this happened \u2013 it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends.\" As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### Human exploitation[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2021, *The Washington Post* published a report detailing a \"black market\" of unlicensed employment agents luring migrant workers from Africa and Asia into indentured servitude as maids in Persian Gulf countries, and using Instagram posts containing their personal information (including in some cases, passport numbers) to market them. Instagram deleted 200 accounts that had been reported by the *Post*, and a spokesperson stated that Instagram took this activity \"extremely seriously\", disabled 200 accounts found by the *Post* to be engaging in these activities, and was continuing to work on systems to automatically detect and disable accounts engaging in human exploitation.[448]\n\n\n\n### July 2022 Updates[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates which immediately received widespread backlash from its userbase. The changes included a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels. The primary criticisms for these updates was Instagram being more like TikTok, instead of photo sharing. The backlash originated from an Instagram post and Change.org petition created by photographer Tati Bruening (under the username @illumitati) on July 23, 2022, featuring the statement \"Make Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\". The post and petition gained mainstream attention after influencers Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted the Instagram post; subsequently, the original post gained over 2 million likes on Instagram and over 275,000 signatures on Change.org.[449][450][451] Instagram walked back the update on July 28, with Meta saying \"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.\"[452] Despite repeated attempts by Meta to shape Instagram to appear and operate more like TikTok, user engagement continued to lag far behind its rival as of 2022.[196]\n\n\n\n## Censorship and restricted content[edit]\n\n\n### Illicit drugs[edit]\n\n\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained:[453][454]\n\n\n\n\n> Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos.\n> \n> \n\n\nHowever, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Inc., Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a \"dedicated team\" reviews the information.[455]\n\n\nIn 2019, Facebook announced that influencers are no longer able to post any vape, tobacco products, and weapons promotions on Facebook and Instagram.[456]\n\n\n\n### Women's bodies[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it broke none of Instagram's terms and conditions.[457] Audra Schroeder of *The Daily Dot* further wrote that \"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post 'pornographic or sexually suggestive photos.'\" You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \"femininity\" the world is \"used to\" seeing and accepting.\"[458] Nick Drewe of *The Daily Beast* wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \"nonsensical and inconsistent\".[459]\n\n\nSimilar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms,[460] and March 2015, when artist and poet Rupi Kaur's photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and Tumblr accounts with the text \"We will not be censored\", gaining over 11,000 shares.[461]\n\n\nThe incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign,[462] an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted Apple's content guidelines for apps published through its App Store, including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.[463][464]\n\n\nThe Iranian government offered moderators bribes up to $9,000 to delete specific accounts, with Masih Alinejad being targeted in particular.[465]\n\n\n\n### Censorship by countries[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(December 2021)*\n |\n\nCensorship of Instagram has occurred in several different countries.\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2020, Instagram and its parent company Facebook, Inc. are removing posts \"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\".[466]\n\n\nOn October 30, 2020, Instagram temporarily removed the \"recent\" tab on hashtag pages to prevent the spread of misinformation regarding the 2020 United States presidential election.[467] On January 7, 2021, United States President Donald Trump was banned from Instagram \"indefinitely\". Zuckerberg stated \"We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\"[468]\n\n\nA few days after Facebook changed its name to Meta, an Australian artist and technologist, Thea-Mai Baumann, had lost access to her @metaverse Instagram handle. Bauman tried to reclaim her access for a month, without success. Only after *The New York Times* published the story and contacted Meta's PR department, was the access restored.[469]\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in China\n\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests as many confrontations with police and incidents occurring during the protests were recorded and photographed. Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are part of special administrative regions of China.[470]\n\n\n\n#### Turkey[edit]\n\n\nTurkey is also known for its strict Internet censorship and periodically blocks social media including Instagram.[471]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet in North Korea\n\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities began to block Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread out.[472]\n\n\n\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in Iran\n\nAs of September 2022, Instagram was one of the last freely available global social media sites in Iran.[473] Instagram is popular among Iranians because it is seen as an outlet for freedom and a \"window to the world.\"[474]\nStill, Iran has sentenced several citizens to prison for posts made on their Instagram accounts.[475] The Iranian government also blocked Instagram periodically during anti-government protests.[476] In July 2021, Instagram temporarily censored videos with the phrase \"death to Khamenei\".[477]\n\n\nIt was blocked along with WhatsApp permanently from September 2022 except for tourists and corporations who are asking for it.[478][479]\n\n\n\n#### Cuba[edit]\n\n\nThe Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including Instagram, to curb the spread of information during the 2021 Cuban protests.[480]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2022, Russia announced it would ban Instagram due to alleged \"calls for violence against Russian troops\" on the platform during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[481] On March 14, the ban took effect, with almost 80 million users losing access to Instagram.[482]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAs of January 7, 2023, the most followed person is Portuguese professional footballer Cristiano Ronaldo with over 530 million followers.[483] As of January 7, 2023, the most-liked photo on Instagram is a carousel of photos from footballer Lionel Messi celebrating winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup, The post has over 74 million likes.[484]\n\n\nIn 2022, Instagram was the second most downloaded mobile app of the year.[485]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Social Animals* (documentary film): A documentary film about three teenagers growing up on Instagram\n* Instagram model: a term for models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on Instagram\n* Instapoetry: a style of poetry which formed by sharing images of short poems by poets on Instagram.\n* Instagram Pier: a cargo working area in Hong Kong that gained its nickname due to its popularity on Instagram\n\n\n## System[edit]\n\n\nInstagram is written in Python.[486]\n\n\nInstagram artificial intelligence (AI) describes content for visually impaired people who use screen readers.[487]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of social networking services\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Dronestagram\n* Internet celebrity\n* Instagram husband\n* Instagram face\n* Pheed\n* Pixnet\n* Social media and suicide\n* Timeline of social media\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The name is often colloquially abbreviated as **IG**, **Insta**, or **the Gram**,[6] legally Instagram, LLC,[7][8] also known as Instagram, Inc.[9][10]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Instagram\". *Instagram*.

Not to be confused with doujin.\n\nDouyin was launched by ByteDance in September 2016, originally under the name A.me, before rebranding to Douyin (\u6296\u97f3) in December 2016.[25][26] Douyin was developed in 200 days and within a year had 100\u00a0million users, with more than one billion videos viewed every day.[27][28]\n\n\nWhile TikTok and Douyin share a similar user interface, the platforms operate separately.[29][3][30] Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search by people's faces for more videos of them, along with other features such as buying, booking hotels, and making geo-tagged reviews.[31]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Evolution[edit]\n\n\nByteDance planned on Douyin expanding overseas. The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, stated that \"China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we don't expand on a global scale, we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four-fifths. So, going global is a must.\"[32]\n\n\nThe app was launched as TikTok in the international market in September 2017.[33] On 23 January 2018, the TikTok app ranked first among free application downloads on app stores in Thailand and other countries.[34]\n\n\nTikTok has been downloaded more than 130\u00a0million times in the United States and has reached 2\u00a0billion downloads worldwide,[35][36] according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower (those numbers exclude Android users in China).[37]\n\n\nIn the United States, celebrities, including Jimmy Fallon and Tony Hawk, began using the app in 2018.[38][39] Other celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba, Will Smith, and Justin Bieber joined TikTok as well as many others.[40]\n\n\nIn January 2019, TikTok allowed creators to embed merchandise sale links into their videos.[41]\n\n\nOn 3 September 2019, TikTok and the U.S. National Football League (NFL) announced a multi-year partnership.[42] The agreement occurred just two days before the NFL's 100th season kick-off at Soldier Field, where TikTok hosted activities for fans in honor of the deal. The partnership entails the launch of an official NFL TikTok account, which is to bring about new marketing opportunities such as sponsored videos and hashtag challenges. In July 2020, TikTok, excluding Douyin, reported close to 800 million monthly active users worldwide after less than four years of existence.[43]\n\n\nIn May 2021, TikTok appointed Shou Zi Chew as their new CEO[44] who assumed the position from interim CEO Vanessa Pappas, following the resignation of Kevin A. Mayer on 27 August 2020.[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok reported that it had reached 1 billion users.[48] In 2021, TikTok earned $4 billion in advertising revenue.[49]\n\n\nIn October 2022, TikTok was reported to be planning an expansion into the e-commerce market in the US, following the launch of TikTok Shop in the United Kingdom. The company posted job listings for staff for a series of order fulfillment centers in the US and is reportedly planning to start the new live shopping business before the end of the year.[50]\n\n\nAccording to data from app analytics group Sensor Tower, advertising on TikTok in the US grew by 11% in March 2023, with companies including Pepsi, DoorDash, Amazon and Apple among the top spenders. According to estimates from research group Insider Intelligence, TikTok is projected to generate $14.15 billion in revenue in 2023, up from $9.89 billion in 2022.[51]\n\n\n\n### Musical.ly merger[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Musical.ly\n\nOn 9 November 2017, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, spent nearly $1 billion to purchase musical.ly, a startup headquartered in Shanghai with an overseas office in Santa Monica, California, U.S.[52][53] Musical.ly was a social media video platform that allowed users to create short lip-sync and comedy videos, initially released in August 2014. TikTok merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018 with existing accounts and data consolidated into one app, keeping the title TikTok.[54] This ended musical.ly and made TikTok a worldwide app, excluding China, since China already had Douyin.[53][55][56]\n\n\n\n### Expansion in other markets[edit]\n\n\nTikTok was downloaded over 104\u00a0million times on Apple's App Store during the first half of 2018, according to data provided to CNBC by Sensor Tower.[57]\n\n\nAfter merging with musical.ly in August, downloads increased and TikTok became the most downloaded app in the U.S. in October 2018, which musical.ly had done once before.[58][59] In February 2019, TikTok, together with Douyin, hit one billion downloads globally, excluding Android installs in China.[60] In 2019, media outlets cited TikTok as the 7th-most-downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[61] It was also the most-downloaded app on Apple's App Store in 2018 and 2019, surpassing Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.[62][63] In September 2020, a deal was confirmed between ByteDance and Oracle in which the latter will serve as a partner to provide cloud hosting,[64][65] as TikTok faces attempts to ban it in the United States.[66][67][68][69] In November 2020, TikTok signed a licensing deal with Sony Music.[70] In December 2020, Warner Music Group signed a licensing deal with TikTok.[71][72] In April 2021, Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism partnered with TikTok to promote tourism.[73] It came following the January 2021 winter campaign, initiated through a partnership between the UAE Government Media Office partnered and TikTok to promote the country's tourism.[74]\n\n\nSince 2014, the first non-gaming apps[75] with more than 3 billion downloads were Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger; all owned by Meta. TikTok was the first non-Facebook app to reach that figure. Sensor Tower reported that although TikTok had been banned in India, its largest market, in June 2020, downloads in the rest of the world continue to increase, reaching 3 billion downloads in 2021.[76]\n\n\nThe advertising revenue of short video clips is lower than other social media: while users spend more time, American audience is monetized at a rate of $0.31 per hour, a third the rate of Facebook and a fifth the rate of Instagram, $67 per year while Instagram will make more than $200.[77]\n\n\nTikTok works with Tehran Chamber of Commerce.[78]\n\n\nIn 2023, several high-level executives transferred from ByteDance to TikTok to focus on moneymaking operations. Some moved from Beijing to the US. According to sources for the *Wall Street Journal*, the personnel move led to concerns from some TikTok employees and was reported to the office of US Senator Ted Cruz for further investigation.[79][80]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with other tech platforms[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the size of its user base falls short of that of Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, TikTok reached 1 billion active monthly users faster than any of them.[81] Competition from TikTok prompted Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, to spend $120 million as of 2022 to entice more content creators to its Reels service, although engagement level remained low.[82] Snapchat had likewise paid out $250 million in 2021 to its creators.[83] Many platforms and services, including YouTube Shorts, began to imitate TikTok's format and recommendation page. Those changes caused a backlash from users of Instagram, Spotify, and Twitter.[81]\n\n\nIn March 2022, *The* *Washington Post* reported that Facebook's owner Meta Platforms paid Targeted Victory\u2014a consulting firm backed by supporters of the U.S. Republican Party\u2014to coordinate lobbying and media campaigns against TikTok and portray it as \"a danger to American children and society\". Its efforts included asking local reporters to serve as \"back channels\" of anti-TikTok messages, writing opinion articles and letters to the editor, including one in the name of a concerned parent, amplifying stories about TikTok trends, such as \"devious licks\" and \"Slap a Teacher\", that actually originated on Facebook, and promoting Facebook's own corporate initiatives. Ties to Meta were not disclosed to the other parties involved. Targeted Victory said that it is \"proud of the work\". A Meta spokesperson said that all platforms, including TikTok, should face scrutiny.[84]\n\n\n*The Wall Street Journal* reported that Silicon Valley executives met with US lawmakers to build an \"anti-China alliance\" before TikTok CEO's Congressional hearing in March 2023.[85]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\nAn example of a video that met TikTok requirements and recommendations, showing Crew Dragon *Endeavour* docking with the International Space Station\nThe mobile app allows users to create short videos, which often feature music in the background and can be sped up, slowed down, or edited with a filter.[86] They can also add their own sound on top of the background music. To create a music video with the app, users can choose background music from a wide variety of music genres, edit with a filter and record a 15-second video with speed adjustments before uploading it to share with others on TikTok or other social platforms.[87]\n\n\nThe \"For You\" page on TikTok is a feed of videos that are recommended to users based on their activity on the app. Content is curated by TikTok's artificial intelligence depending on the content a user liked, interacted with, or searched. This is in contrast to other social networks' algorithms basing such content off of the user's relationships with other users and what they liked or interacted with.[88]\n\n\nThe app's \"react\" feature allows users to film their reaction to a specific video, over which it is placed in a small window that is movable around the screen.[89] Its \"duet\" feature allows users to film a video aside from another video.[90] The \"duet\" feature was another trademark of musical.ly. The duet feature is also only able to be used if both parties adjust the privacy settings.[91]\n\n\nVideos that users do not want to post yet can be stored in their \"drafts\". The user is allowed to see their \"drafts\" and post when they find it fitting.[92]\nThe app allows users to set their accounts as \"private\". When first downloading the app, the user's account is public by default. The user can change to private in their settings. Private content remains visible to TikTok but is blocked from TikTok users who the account holder has not authorized to view their content.[93] Users can choose whether any other user, or only their \"friends\", may interact with them through the app via comments, messages, or \"react\" or \"duet\" videos.[89] Users also can set specific videos to either \"public\", \"friends only\", or \"private\" regardless if the account is private or not.[93]\n\n\nUsers can also send their friends videos, emojis, and messages with direct messaging. TikTok has also included a feature to create a video based on the user's comments. Influencers often use the \"live\" feature. This feature is only available for those who have at least 1,000 followers and are over 16 years old. If over 18, the user's followers can send virtual \"gifts\" that can be later exchanged for money.[94][95]\n\n\nTikTok announced a \"family safety mode\" in February 2020 for parents to be able to control their children's presence on the app. There is a screen time management option, restricted mode, and the option to put a limit on direct messages.[96][97] The app expanded its parental controls feature called \"Family Pairing\" in September 2020 to provide parents and guardians with educational resources to understand what children on TikTok are exposed to. Content for the feature was created in partnership with online safety nonprofit, Internet Matters.[98]\n\n\nIn October 2021, TikTok launched a test feature that allows users to directly tip certain creators. Accounts of users that are of age, have at least 100,000 followers and agree to the terms can activate a \"Tip\" button on their profile, which allows followers to tip any amount, starting from $1.[99]\n\n\nIn December 2021, TikTok started beta-testing Live Studio, a streaming software that would let users broadcast applications open on their computers, including games. The software also launched with support for mobile and PC streaming.[100] However, a few days later, users on Twitter discovered that the software uses code from the open-source OBS Studio. OBS made a statement saying that, under the GNU GPL version 2, TikTok has to make the code of Live Studio publicly available if it wants to use any code from OBS.[101]\n\n\nIn May 2022, TikTok announced TikTok Pulse, an ad revenue-sharing program. It covers the \"top 4% of all videos on TikTok\" and is only available to creators with more than 100,000 followers. If an eligible creator's video reaches the top 4%, they will receive a 50% share of the revenue from ads displayed with the video.[102]\n\n\nIn July 2023, TikTok launched a new streaming service called TikTok Music, currently available only in Brazil and Indonesia.[103] This service allows users to listen to, download and share songs.[103] It is reported that TikTok Music features songs from major record companies like Universal Music Group, Sony Music and Warner Music Group.[103] On 19 July 2023, TikTok Music was expanded for select users in Australia, Mexico and Singapore.[104]\n\n\n\n## Content[edit]\n\n\n### Viral trends[edit]\n\n\nThe app has spawned numerous viral trends, Internet celebrities, and music trends around the world.[105] Duets, a feature that allows users to add their own video to an existing video with the original content's audio, have sparked many of these trends.[106] Many stars got their start on musical.ly, which merged with TikTok on 2 August 2018. These include Loren Gray, Baby Ariel, Zach King, Lisa and Lena, Jacob Sartorius, and many others. Loren Gray remained the most-followed individual on TikTok until Charli D'Amelio surpassed her on 25 March 2020. Gray's was the first TikTok account to reach 40\u00a0million followers on the platform. She was surpassed with 41.3 million followers. D'Amelio was the first to ever reach 50, 60, and 70\u00a0million followers. Charli D'Amelio remained the most-followed individual on the platform until she was surpassed by Khaby Lame on 23 June 2022. Other creators rose to fame after the platform merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018.[107] TikTok also played a major part in making \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X one of the biggest songs of 2019 and the longest-running number-one song in the history of the US *Billboard* Hot 100.[108][109][110]\n\n\nTikTok has allowed many music artists to gain a wider audience, often including foreign fans. For example, despite never having toured in Asia, the band Fitz and the Tantrums developed a large following in South Korea following the widespread popularity of their 2016 song \"HandClap\" on the platform.[111] \"Any Song\" by R&B and rap artist Zico became number one on the Korean music charts due to the popularity of the #anysongchallenge, where users dance to the choreography of the song.[112] The platform has also launched many songs that failed to garner initial commercial success into sleeper hits, particularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.[113][114] However, it has received criticism for not paying royalties to artists whose music is used on the platform.[115]\n\n\nClassic stars are able to connect with younger audiences born decades after a musician's first debut and across traditional genres. In 2020 Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\" was used in a skating video and a recreation by Mick Fleetwood. The song re-entered *Billboard* Hot 100 after 43 years and topped Apple Music. In 2022, Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\" went viral among fans of Stranger Things, topping the UK singles chart 37 years after its original release. In 2023 Kylie Minogue's \"Padam Padam\" entered the Radio 1 playlist after being shared by Gen Z, even though many youth radio stations had refused to play it. Other older artists with strong engagement on TikTok include Elton John and Rod Stewart.[116]\n\n\nIn June 2020, TikTok users and K-pop fans \"claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets\" for President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa through communication on TikTok,[117] contributing to \"rows of empty seats\"[118] at the event. Later, in October 2020, an organization called *TikTok for Biden* was created to support then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.[119] After the election, the organization was renamed to *Gen-Z for Change*.[120][121]\n\n\nOn 10 August 2020, Emily Jacobssen wrote and sang \"Ode to Remy\", a song praising the protagonist from Pixar's 2007 computer-animated film *Ratatouille*. The song rose to popularity when musician Daniel Mertzlufft composed a backing track to the song. In response, began creating a \"crowdsourced\" project called *Ratatouille the Musical*. Since Mertzlufft's video, many new elements including costume design, additional songs, and a playbill have been created.[122] On 1 January 2021, a full one-hour virtual presentation of *Ratatouille the Musical* premiered on TodayTix. It starred Titus Burgess as Remy, Wayne Brady as Django, Adam Lambert as Emile, Kevin Chamberlin as Gusteau, Andrew Barth Feldman as Linguini, Ashley Park as Colette, Priscilla Lopez as Mabel, Mary Testa as Skinner, and Andr\u00e9 De Shields as Ego.\n\n\nA viral TikTok trend known as \"devious licks\" involves students vandalizing or stealing school property and posting videos of the action on the platform. The trend has led to increasing school vandalism and subsequent measures taken by some schools to prevent damage. Some students have been arrested for participating in the trend.[123][124] TikTok has taken measures to remove and prevent access to content displaying the trend.[125] Another TikTok trend known as the Kia Challenge involves users stealing certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars manufactured without immobilizers, which was a standard feature at the time, between 2010 and 2021.[126] As of February 2023, it had resulted in at least 14 crashes and eight deaths according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.[127] In May, Kia and Hyundai settled a $200-million class-action lawsuit by agreeing to provide software updates to affected vehicles and over 26,000 steering wheel locks.[128]\n\n\nIn 2023, a trend emerged where streamers acted as if they were video-game characters following prompts from their viewers.[129]\n\n\nOn Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, some celebrities who had garnered large followings as of August 2019 include Dilraba Dilmurat, Angelababy, Luo Zhixiang, Ouyang Nana, and Pan Changjiang.[130] In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a Qatari teenage royal became an Internet celebrity after his angry expressions were recorded in Qatar's opening match loss to Ecuador;[131] he amassed more than 15 million followers in less than a week after creating a Douyin account.[132]\n\n\n\n#### Food and recipes[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from TikTok food trends.[edit]\nTikTok food trends are specific food recipes and food-related fads on the social media platform TikTok.[133] This content amassed popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people cooked and ate at home and more people turned to social media for entertainment.[133] While some TikTok users share their diets and recipes, others expand their brand or image on TikTok through step-by-step videos of easy and popular recipes.[134] Users often refer to food-related content as \"FoodTok.\"[133]\n\n\n\nThe hashtags #TikTokFood and #FoodTok are used to identify food-related content,[135] and have been viewed 40.2 billion and 9.7 billion times respectively since the app's creation, according to the company. Food trends have had profound societal impacts on their millions of viewers.[134] There has been increased popularity in youth cooking, conversations on body image, use of marketing of food products on social media, and food shortages due to mass trends.[136][137][138] Certain TikTok content creators such as Eitan Bernath, Jeron Combs, and Emily Mariko have achieved fame by crafting recipes that have become food trends. They and their colleagues have developed recipes such as the leftover salmon bowl, baked feta cheese pasta, and pesto eggs.[139][140][141]\n\n#### Fashion and body size[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Model (people) \u00a7\u00a0Types\n\n\"Midsize\" fashion gained greater exposure on TikTok after many creators opened up about not able to find clothing sizes that fit them well. Women's apparel can roughly be divided into petite, straight, and plus sizes, leaving gaps in between. Realistic videos about how differently pieces of garment fit on a model compared to how they fit on a typical consumer resonated with many who had believed that they were alone in their struggle.[142][143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Cosmetic surgery[edit]\n\n\nContent promoting cosmetic surgery is popular on TikTok and has spawned several viral trends on the platform. In December 2021, *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery*, the journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, published an article about the popularity of some plastic surgeons on TikTok. In the article, it was noted that plastic surgeons were some of the earliest adopters of social media in the medical field and many had been recognized as influencers on the platform. The article published stats about the most popular plastic surgeons on TikTok up to February 2021 and at the time, five different plastic surgeons had surpassed 1 million followers on the platform.[145][146]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was reported that a trend known as the #NoseJobCheck trend was going viral on TikTok. TikTok content creators used a specific audio on their videos while showing how their noses looked before and after having their rhinoplasty surgeries. By January 2021, the hashtag #nosejob had accumulated 1.6 billion views, #nosejobcheck had accumulated 1 billion views, and the audio used in the #NoseJobCheck trend had been used in 120,000 videos.[147] In 2020, Charli D'Amelio, the most-followed person on TikTok at the time, also made a #NoseJobCheck video to show the results of her surgery to repair her previously broken nose.[148]\n\n\nIn April 2022, NBC News reported that surgeons were giving influencers on the platform discounted or free cosmetic surgeries in order to advertise the procedures to their audiences. They also reported that facilities that offered these surgeries were also posting about them on TikTok. TikTok has banned the advertising of cosmetic surgeries on the platform but cosmetic surgeons are still able to reach large audiences using unpaid photo and video posts. NBC reported that videos using the hashtags '#plasticsurgery' and '#lipfiller' had amassed a combined 26 billion views on the platform.[149]\n\n\nIn December 2022, it was reported that a cosmetic surgery procedure known as buccal fat removal was going viral on the platform. The procedure involves surgically removing fat from the cheeks in order to give the face a slimmer and more chiseled appearance. Videos using hashtags related to buccal fat removal had collectively amassed over 180 million views. Some TikTok users criticized the trend for promoting an unobtainable beauty standard.[150][151][152]\n\n\n\n### STEM feed[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, TikTok introduced a dedicated feed for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) content. It works with Common Sense Networks to check for safety and age appropriateness and with the Poynter Institute for reliability of information.[153][154]\n\n\n\n### Heating[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2023, *Forbes* reported that a \"heating\" tool allows TikTok to manually promote certain videos, comprising 1-2% of daily views. The practice began as a way to grow and diversify content and influencers that were not automatically picked up by the recommendation algorithm. It was also used to promote brands, artists, and NGOs, such as the FIFA World Cup and Taylor Swift.[155] However, some employees have abused it to promote their own accounts or those of their spouses, while others have felt that their guidelines leave too much room for discretion. TikTok said only a few individuals can approve heating in the U.S. and the promoted videos take up less than 0.002% of user feeds. To address concerns of Chinese influence, the company is negotiating with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) such that future heating could only be performed by vetted security personnel in the U.S. and the process would be audited by third-parties such as Oracle.[156]\n\n\n\n### Censorship and moderation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship by TikTok\n\nTikTok's and Douyin's censorship policies have been criticized as non-transparent. Internal guidelines against the promotion of violence, separatism, and \"demonization of countries\" could be used to prohibit content related to the Tiananmen Square crackdown, Falun Gong, Tibet, Taiwan, Chechnya, Northern Ireland, the Cambodian genocide, the 1998 Indonesian riots, Kurdish nationalism, ethnic conflicts between blacks and whites, or between different Islamic sects. A more specific list banned criticisms against world leaders, including past and present ones from Russia, the United States, Japan, North and South Korea, India, Indonesia, and Turkey.[157][158] In 2019, TikTok took down a video about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang internment camps against Uyghurs but restored it after 50 minutes as well as the creator's account, saying that the action was a mistake and triggered by a brief \"satirical\" image of Osama bin Laden in another post.[159][160]\n\n\nTikTok moderators were instructed to suppress posts from \"For You\" recommendations if the users shown were deemed \"too ugly, poor, or disabled\".[161][162] The consumption of alcohol, full or partial nudity, LGBT and intersex contents were restricted even in places where they are legal.[163] TikTok has since apologized and instituted a ban against anti-LGBTQ ideology, but censorship continues on Douyin due to regulations in China.[164][165] Douyin guidelines also forbid live broadcasting by unregistered foreigners, \"feudal superstition\", \"money worship\", smoking and drinking, competitive eating by the \"already obese\", \"toxic\" slime, \"pornographic\" ASMR such as ear-licking, and female anchors wearing revealing clothes.[158]\n\n\nByteDance said its early guidelines were global and aimed at reducing online harassment and divisiveness when its platforms were still growing. They have been replaced by versions customized by local teams for users in different regions.[166]\n\n\nA March 2021 study by the Citizen Lab found that TikTok did not censor searches politically but was inconclusive about whether posts are.[3][167] A 2023 paper by the Internet Governance Project at Georgia Institute of Technology found no pro-China censorship on TikTok.[168]\n\n\nFollowing increased scrutiny, TikTok said it is granting some outside experts access to the platform's anonymized data sets and protocols, including filters, keywords, criteria for heating, and source code.[169][170]\n\n\n\n### Extremism and hate[edit]\n\n\nConcerns have been voiced regarding content relating to, and the promotion and spreading of hate speech and far-right extremism, such as antisemitism, islamophobia, racism, and xenophobia. Some videos were shown to expressly promote Holocaust denial and told viewers to take up arms and fight in the name of white supremacy and the swastika.[171] As TikTok has gained popularity among young children,[172] and the popularity of extremist and hateful content is growing, calls for tighter restrictions on their flexible boundaries have been made. TikTok has since released tougher parental controls to filter out inappropriate content and to ensure they can provide sufficient protection and security.[173]\n\n\nIn Malaysia, TikTok is used by some users to engage in hate speech against race and religion especially mentioning the 13 May incident after the 2022 election. TikTok responded by taking down videos with content that violated their community guidelines.[174]\n\n\nIn March 2023, *The Jewish Chronicle* reported that TikTok still hosted videos that promoted the neo-Nazi propaganda film *Europa: The Last Battle*, despite having been alerted to the issue four months prior. TikTok said it removed and would continue to remove the content and associated accounts and has blocked the search term as well.[175]\n\n\n\n#### ISIL propaganda[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of social media by the Islamic State\n\nIn October 2019, TikTok removed about two dozen accounts that were responsible for posting ISIL propaganda and execution videos on the app.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Misinformation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: COVID-19 misinformation\n\nTikTok has banned Holocaust denial, but other conspiracy theories have become popular on the platform, such as Pizzagate and QAnon (two conspiracy theories popular among the U.S. alt-right) whose hashtags reached almost 80\u00a0million views and 50\u00a0million views respectively by June 2020.[178] The platform has also been used to spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, such as clips from *Plandemic*.[178] TikTok removed some of these videos and has generally added links to accurate COVID-19 information on videos with tags related to the pandemic.[179]\n\n\nIn January 2020, left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America said that TikTok hosted misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic despite a recent policy against misinformation.[180] In April 2020, the government of India asked TikTok to remove users posting misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[181] There were also multiple conspiracy theories that the government is involved with the spread of the pandemic.[182] As a response to this, TikTok launched a feature to report content for misinformation.[183] It reported that in the second half of 2020, over 340,000 videos in the U.S. about election misinformation and 50,000 videos of COVID-19 misinformation were removed.[184]\n\n\nTo combat misinformation in the 2022 midterm election in the US, TikTok announced a midterms Elections Center available in-app to users in 40 different languages. TikTok partnered with the National Association of Secretaries of State to give accurate local information to users.[185]\n\n\nIn September 2022, NewsGuard Technologies reported that among the TikTok searches it had conducted and analyzed from the U.S., 19.4% surfaced misinformation such as questionable or harmful content about COVID-19 vaccines, homemade remedies, the 2020 US elections, the war in Ukraine, the Robb Elementary School shooting, and abortion. NewsGuard suggested that in contrast, results from Google were of higher quality.[186] Mashable's own test from Australia found innocuous results after searching for \"getting my COVID vaccine\" but suggestions such as \"climate change is a myth\" after typing in \"climate change\".[184]\n\n\n\n### Russian invasion of Ukraine[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nAs of 2022, TikTok is the 10th most popular app in Russia.[187] After a new set of Russian fake news laws was installed in March 2022, the company announced a series of restrictions on Russian and non-Russian posts and livestreams.[188][189] *Tracking Exposed*, a user data rights group, learned of what was likely a technical glitch that became exploited by pro-Russia posters. It stated that although this and other loopholes were patched by TikTok before the end of March, the initial failure to correctly implement the restrictions, in addition to the effects from Kremlin's \"fake news\" laws, contributed to the formation of a \"splInternet ... dominated by pro-war content\" in Russia.[190][187] TikTok said that it had removed 204 accounts for swaying public opinion about the war while obscuring their origins and that its fact checkers had removed 41,191 videos for violating its misinformation policies.[191][192]\n\n\n\n## Usage[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of most-followed TikTok accounts\n\nTikTok tends to appeal to younger users, as 41% of its users are between the ages of 16 and 24. These individuals are considered Generation Z.[88] Among these TikTok users, 90% said they used the app daily.[193] TikTok's geographical use in 2019 has shown that 43% of new users were from India before the social platform was banned in the country.[194] But adults have also seen growth on TikTok. The share of U.S. adults who regularly get news from TikTok hit 14% in 2023.[195]\n\n\nBy July 2023, TikTok has become the primary news source for British teenagers on social media, with 28% of 12 to 15-year-olds relying on the platform, while traditional sources like BBC One/Two are more trusted at 82%, according to a report by UK regulator Ofcom.[196]\n\n\nAs of the first quarter of 2022, there were over 100 million monthly active users in the United States and 23 million in the UK. The average user, daily, was spending 1 hour and 25 minutes on the app and opening TikTok 17 times.[197] Out of TikTok's top 100 male creators, a 2022 analysis reported 67% were white, with 54% having near-perfect facial symmetry.[198]\n\n\nPopular TikTok users have lived collectively in collab houses, predominantly in the Los Angeles area.[199]\n\n\n\n#### Teenage mode[edit]\n\n\nChina heavily regulates how Douyin is used by minors in the country, especially after 2018.[200] Under government pressure, ByteDance introduced parental controls and a \"teenage mode\" that shows only whitelisted content, such as knowledge sharing, and bans pranks, superstition, dance clubs, and pro-LGBT content.[a][164] A mandatory screen time limit was put in place for users under the age of 14 and a requirement to link accounts to a real identity to prevent minors from lying about their age or using an adult's account. The differences between Douyin and TikTok have led some US politicians and commentators to accuse the company or the Chinese government of malicious intent.[200][201] In March 2023, TikTok announced default screen time limits for users under the age of 18. Those under the age of 13 would need a passcode from their parents to extend their time.[200]\n\n\n\n### Influencer marketing[edit]\n\n\nTikTok has provided a platform for users to create content not only for fun but also for money. As the platform has grown significantly over the past few years, it has allowed companies to advertise and rapidly reach their intended demographic through influencer marketing.[202] The platform's AI algorithm also contributes to the influencer marketing potential, as it picks out content according to the user's preference.[203] Sponsored content is not as prevalent on the platform as it is on other social media apps, but brands and influencers still can make as much as they would if not more in comparison to other platforms.[203] Influencers on the platform who earn money through engagement, such as likes and comments, are referred to as \"meme machines\".[202]\n\n\nIn 2021, *The New York Times* reported that viral TikTok videos by young people relating the emotional impact of books on them, tagged with the label \"BookTok\", significantly drove sales of literature. Publishers were increasingly using the platform as a venue for influencer marketing.[204]\n\n\nIn December 2022, NBC News reported in a television segment that some TikTok and YouTube influencers were being given free and discounted cosmetic surgeries in order for them to advertise the surgeries to users of the platforms.[205]\n\n\nIn 2022, it was reported that a trend called \"de-influencing\" had become popular on the platform as a backlash to influencer marketing. TikTok creators participating in this trend made videos criticizing products promoted by influencers and asked their audiences not to buy products they did not need. However, some creators participating in the trend started promoting alternative products to their audiences and earning commission from sales made through their affiliate links in the same manner as the influencers they were originally criticizing.[206][207]\n\n\nIn June 2022, *NBC News* reported that some of the influencers paid by *FeetFinder*, a website that sells foot fetish content, did not disclose their videos were ads. FeetFinder said that it has suggested to influencers to be upfront about who was funding them. Existing sellers on FeetFinder said that the videos often misrepresented how \"easy\" it is to make money from posting feet pictures. Other TikTok creators have spoken out against accepting sponsorship deals indiscriminately and criticized those who posted undisclosed FeetFinder ads.[208]\n\n\n\n### Businesses[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2020, the e-commerce platform Shopify added TikTok to its portfolio of social media platforms, allowing online merchants to sell their products directly to consumers on TikTok.[209]\n\n\nSome small businesses have used TikTok to advertise and to reach an audience wider than the geographical region they would normally serve. The viral response to many small business TikTok videos has been attributed to TikTok's algorithm, which shows content that viewers at large are drawn to, but which they are unlikely to actively search for (such as videos on unconventional types of businesses, like beekeeping and logging).[210]\n\n\nIn 2020, digital media companies such as Group Nine Media and Global used TikTok increasingly, focusing on tactics such as brokering partnerships with TikTok influencers and developing branded content campaigns.[211] Notable collaborations between larger brands and top TikTok influencers have included Chipotle's partnership with David Dobrik in May 2019[212] and Dunkin' Donuts' partnership with Charli D'Amelio in September 2020.[213]\n\n\n\n### Sex workers[edit]\n\n\nTikTok is regularly used by sex workers to promote pornographic content sold on platforms such as OnlyFans.[214] One porn actor posted a viral song referring to himself as an \"accountant\", starting a trend.[215] In 2020 TikTok updated their terms of service to ban content that promotes \"premium sexual content\", impacting a large number of adult content creators.[216] In response, they began substituting words in their captions and videos and using filters to censor explicit images. Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, believes that at some point, censorship becomes a fool's errand and we would never be \"able to sanitize the Internet\".[217][218] Some adult content creators have found a way to game TikTok's recommendation algorithm by posting riddles, which attract a large number of viewers trying and failing to solve them. Some of them are redirected to the creators' OnlyFans accounts and end up as subscribers there.[219]\n\n\n\n### Cyberbullying[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Problematic social media use\n\n*Vox* noted in 2018 that bullies and trolls were relatively rare on TikTok compared to other platforms.[220] Nonetheless, several users have reported cyberbullying via features such as Duet or React, which is used to interact with followers.[221] A trend making fun of autism eventually created a huge backlash, even on the platform itself, and the company ended up removing the hashtag altogether.[222][223] Parents filming how their children reacted to people with disability, often in terror, led to criticisms of ableism.[224] In December 2019, following a report by German digital rights group netzpolitik.org, TikTok admitted that it had suppressed videos by disabled users as well as LGBTQ+ users in a purported temporary effort to limit cyberbullying.[225][161]\n\n\n\n### Addiction and mental health[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Digital media use and mental health and Social media and suicide\n\nThere are concerns that some users may find it hard to stop using TikTok.[226] In April 2018, an addiction-reduction feature was added to Douyin.[226] This encouraged users to take a break every 90 minutes.[226] Later in 2018, the feature was rolled out to the TikTok app. TikTok uses popular influencers to encourage viewers to stop using the app and take a break.[227]\n\n\nMany were also concerned with the app affecting users' attention spans due to the short-form nature of the content. This is a concern as many of TikTok's audience are younger children, whose brains are still developing.[228] TikTok executives and representatives have noted and made aware to advertisers on the platform that users have poor attention spans. With a large amount of video content, nearly 50% of users find it stressful to watch a video longer than a minute and a third of users watch videos at double speed.[197] TikTok has also received criticism for enabling children to purchase coins which they can send to other users.[229]\n\n\nIn February 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that \"Mental-health professionals around the country are growing increasingly concerned about the effects on teen girls of posting sexualized TikTok videos.\"[230] In March 2022, a coalition of U.S. state attorneys general launched an investigation into TikTok's effect on children's mental health.[231] In June 2022, TikTok introduced the ability to set a maximum uninterrupted screen time allowance, after which the app blocks off the ability to navigate the feed. The block only lifts after the app is exited and left unused for a set period of time. Additionally, the app features a dashboard with statistics on how often the app is opened, how much time is spent browsing it and when the browsing occurs.[232]\n\n\nSince 2021, it has been reported that accounts engaging with contents related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder were fed more of similar videos. Some users were able to circumvent TikTok filters by writing in code or using unconventional spelling. The company has faced multiple lawsuits pertaining to wrongful deaths. TikTok said it is working to break up these \"rabbit holes\" of similar recommendations. US searches for eating disorder receive a prompt that offers mental health resources.[233][234][235]\n\n\nIn 2021, the platform revealed that it will be introducing a feature that will prevent teenagers from receiving notifications past their bedtime. The company will no longer send push notifications after 9 pm to users aged between 13 and 15. For 16 to 17 year olds, notifications will not be sent after 10 pm.[236] In March 2023, TikTok announced default screen time limits for users under the age of 18. Those under the age of 13 would need a passcode from their parents to extend their time.[237]\n\n\n*The Wall Street Journal* has reported that doctors experienced a surge in reported cases of tics, tied to an increasing number of TikTok videos from content creators with Tourette syndrome. Doctors suggested that the cause may be a social one as users who consumed content showcasing various tics would sometimes develop tics of their own,[238] akin to mass psychogenic illness.[239][240]\n\n\n\n### Privacy concerns[edit]\n\n\nPrivacy concerns have also been brought up regarding the app.[241][242] In its privacy policy, TikTok lists that it collects usage information, IP addresses, a user's mobile carrier, unique device identifiers, keystroke patterns, and location data, among other data.[243][244][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Check Point Research discovered a vulnerability, later patched by TikTok, whereby a hacker could spoof TikTok's official SMS messages and replace them with malicious links to gain access to user accounts.[245]\n\n\nIn February, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman criticized the app, calling it \"spyware\".[246][247] TikTok said the accusations were made without evidence.[243]\n\n\nIn July, Wells Fargo banned the app from company devices due to privacy and security concerns.[248]\n\n\nIn August 2020, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that TikTok tracked Android user data, including MAC addresses and IMEIs, with a tactic in violation of Google's policies.[249][250] The report sparked calls in the U.S. Senate for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation.[251]\n\n\nA March 2021 study by the Citizen Lab found that TikTok did not collect data beyond the industry norms, what its policy stated, or without additional user permission.[167]\n\n\nIn June 2021, TikTok updated its privacy policy to include potential collection of biometric data, including \"faceprints and voiceprints\", for special effects and other purposes. The terms said that user authorization would be requested if local law demands such.[252] Experts considered the terms to be \"vague\" and their implications \"problematic\" in light of the general lack of robust data privacy laws in the United States.[253] Also in June, CNBC reported that according to former TikTok employees, some staff members in China and employees at ByteDance had access to US user data.[254]\n\n\nIn October 2021, following the Facebook Files and controversies about social media ethics, a bipartisan group of lawmakers also pressed TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat on questions of data privacy and moderation for age-appropriate content. Lawmakers also \"hammered\" TikTok about whether consumer data could be turned over to Beijing through ByteDance, its parent company in China.[255] TikTok said it does not give information to China's government and \"U.S. user data\" is stored within the country with backups in Singapore. According to the company's representative, TikTok had \"no affiliation\" with the subsidiary Beijing ByteDance Technology, in which the Chinese government has a minority stake and board seat.[256]\n\n\nIn August 2022, software engineer and security researcher Felix Krause found that in-app browsers from TikTok and other platforms contained codes for keylogger functionality but did not have the means to further investigate whether any data was tracked or recorded. TikTok said that the code is disabled.[257]\n\n\nIn a November 2022 update to its European privacy policy, TikTok stated that its global corporate group employees from China and other countries could gain remote access to the user information of accounts from Europe based on \"demonstrated need\".[258]\n\n\nIn May 2023, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that former employees complained about TikTok tracking users who had viewed LGBT-related content, leading to fears of collected data potentially usable for blackmail.[259] It also reported that a former employee from 2018 was suing TikTok's parent, ByteDance, for wrongful termination from his job. The suit alleges that Hong Kong users' device information and communications were accessed by Chinese Communist Party members. ByteDance denied the claims and said the employee worked on a defunct project. The company pulled TikTok out of Hong Kong in 2020.[260]\n\n\nIn June 2023, TikTok confirmed that some financial information, such as tax forms and Social Security numbers, of American content creators are stored in China. This applies to those signing contracts with and receiving payment transactions from ByteDance. Whether similar information will remain exempt from being treated as \"protected user data\" is being negotiated with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Underage users[edit]\n\n\nAs with other platforms popular with children, underage users may inadvertently reveal their daily routine and whereabouts, raising concerns of potential misuse by sexual predators.[262][263] At the time of reporting (2018), TikTok had only two privacy settings, either private or completely public, without any middle ground.[264] Comment sections of \"sexy\" videos, such as young girls dancing in revealing clothes, were found to contain requests for nude pictures. TikTok itself forbids direct messaging of videos and photos, which meant follow-up interactions, if any, would have to take place in some other form.[265][220]\n\n\nOn 22 January 2021, the Italian Data Protection Authority demanded that TikTok temporarily suspend Italian users whose age could not be established.[266] The order came after the death of a 10-year-old Sicilian girl involved in an Internet challenge. TikTok asked its users in Italy to confirm again that they were over 13 years old. By May, over 500,000 accounts had been removed for failing the age check.[267]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the Dutch Data Protection Authority fined TikTok \u20ac750,000 euros for offering privacy statements only in English but not in Dutch. It noted that TikTok had implemented positive measures, such as forbidding direct messaging for users younger than 16 and allowing their parents to manage privacy settings directly through a paired family account, but the risk of children pretending to be older when creating their account remains.[268][269]\n\n\nTikTok raised the minimum age for livestreaming from 16 to 18 after a BBC News investigation found hundreds of accounts going live from Syrian refugee camps. 30 of them showed children begging for digital donation. TikTok reportedly took a 70% commission from some of them, a figure that the company disputed.[270]\n\n\n\n#### Journalist spying scandal[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2022, *BuzzFeed News* reported that leaked audio recordings of internal TikTok meetings reveal employees in China had access to overseas data, including a \"master admin\" who could see \"everything\". Some of the recordings were made during consultations with Booz Allen Hamilton, a US government contractor. A spokesperson of the contractor said some of the report's information was inaccurate but would neither confirm nor deny whether TikTok was one of its clients.[271] Following the reports, TikTok confirmed that employees in China could have access to U.S. data.[272] It also announced that US user traffic would now be routed through Oracle Cloud and that backup copies would be deleted from other servers.[273]\n\n\nIn October 2022, *Forbes* reported that a team at ByteDance planned to surveil certain US citizens for undisclosed reasons. TikTok said that the tracking method suggested by the report would not be feasible because precise GPS information is not collected by the platform.[274][275] In December 2022, ByteDance confirmed after internal investigation that the data of two journalists and their close contacts had been accessed by its employees from China and the United States on an \"audit\" team. The audit was intended to uncover sources of leaks who might have met with the journalists from *Forbes* and the *Financial Times*. The data accessed included IP addresses, which can be used to approximate a user's location. Four employees have been terminated, including the audit team's lead Chris Lepitak and his superior, executive Song Ye. ByteDance and TikTok condemned the individuals' misuse of authority.[276] The incident is being investigated by the US Department of Justice and FBI.[277][278][279] The US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia reportedly subpoenaed information from ByteDance regarding efforts made to access US journalists' private user data using TikTok.[280]\n\n\n\n#### European data privacy investigations[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, the Ireland Data Protection Commission (DPC) launched investigations into TikTok concerning the protection of minors' data and transfers of personal data to China.[281][282] The Irish DPC became the lead agency to handle such matters after TikTok established an office in the country, taking over investigations started by Dutch and Italian authorities.[283][268] In September 2023, the DPC fined TikTok \u20ac345 million for violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) vis-\u00e0-vis the mishandling of children data.[284][285]\n\n\n\n#### Project Clover[edit]\n\n\nTikTok has faced criticism for transferring European user data to servers in the United States. It is holding discussions with UK's National Cyber Security Centre about a \"Project Clover\" for storing European information locally. The company plans to build two data centers in Ireland and one more in Norway. A third party will oversee the cybersecurity policies, data flows, and personnel access independently of TikTok.[286][287][15]\n\n\n\n#### UK Information Commissioner's Office investigation[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office launched an investigation of TikTok following the fine ByteDance received from the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said that the investigation focuses on the issues of private data collection, the kind of videos collected and shared by children online, as well as the platform's open messaging system which allows any adult to message any child. She noted that the company was potentially violating the GDPR which requires the company to provide different services and different protections for children.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Privacy Commissioner of Canada investigation[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, along with its counterparts in Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, launched an investigation into TikTok's data collection practices.[289]\n\n\n\n#### Texas Attorney General investigation[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the incumbent Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, initiated an investigation into TikTok for alleged violations of children's privacy and facilitation of human trafficking.[290][291] Paxton claimed that the Texas Department of Public Safety gathered several pieces of content showing the attempted recruitment of teenagers to smuggle people or goods across the Mexico\u2013United States border. He claimed the evidence may prove the company's involvement in \"human smuggling, sex trafficking and drug trafficking\". The company claimed that no illegal activity of any kind is supported on the platform.[292]\n\n\n\n#### U.S. COPPA fines[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act\n\nOn 27 February 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined ByteDance U.S.$5.7\u00a0million for collecting information from minors under the age of 13 in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.[293] ByteDance responded by adding a kids-only mode to TikTok which blocks the upload of videos, the building of user profiles, direct messaging, and commenting on others' videos, while still allowing the viewing and recording of content.[294] In May 2020, an advocacy group filed a complaint with the FTC saying that TikTok had violated the terms of the February 2019 consent decree, which sparked subsequent Congressional calls for a renewed FTC investigation.[295][296][297][298] In July 2020, it was reported that the FTC and the United States Department of Justice had initiated investigations.[299]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Medication shortage[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Australia's medical regulatory agency, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) reported that there was a global shortage of the diabetes medication Ozempic. According to the TGA, the rise in demand was caused by an increase in off-label prescription of the drug for weight loss purposes.[300] In December 2022, with the United States experiencing a shortage as well, it was reported that the huge increase in demand for the medicine was caused by a weight loss trend on TikTok, where videos about the drug exceeded 360 million views.[301][302][303] Wegovy, a drug that has been specifically approved for treating obesity, also became popular on the platform after Elon Musk credited it for helping him lose weight.[304][305]\n\n\n\n### Workplace conditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Overwork\n\nSeveral former employees of the company have claimed of poor workplace conditions, including the start of the workweek on Sunday to cooperate with Chinese timezones and excessive workload. Employees claimed they averaged 85 hours of meetings per week and would frequently stay up all night in order to complete tasks. Some employees claimed the workplace's schedule operated similarly to the 996 schedule. The company has a stated policy of working from 10 AM to 7 PM five days per week (63 hours per week), but employees noted that it was encouraged for employees to work after hours. One female worker complained that the company did not allow her adequate time to change her feminine hygiene product because of back-to-back meetings. Another employee noted that working at the company caused her to seek marriage therapy and lose an unhealthy amount of weight.[306] In response to the allegations, the company noted that they were committed to allowing employees \"support and flexibility\".[307][308]\n\n\n\n### Osama bin Laden's Letter[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Letter to the American people\n\nIn November 2023, amid the Hamas-Israel war, Bin Laden's 2002 \"*Letter to the American people*\" went viral on TikTok and other social media. In the letter, Bin Laden denounced the US and its support for Israel, and supported al-Qaeda's war against the US as a defensive struggle. Numerous social media users, including Americans, expressed their opposition to US foreign policy by sharing the resurfaced copies of the letter and its contents. *The Guardian* website removed the letter after displaying it for more than 20 years, and TikTok began issuing takedowns of videos featuring the letter.[309] Reporting in *The Washington Post* suggested that the virality of the letter had been limited prior to media coverage, having never trended on TikTok. Many of the TikTok videos covering the letter were critical of bin Laden, and media coverage had exaggerated its significance while elevating the virality of the letter.[310]\n\n\n\n## Bans and attempted bans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Censorship of TikTok\n\n![](image)Countries that banned TikTok on governmental devices\n Countries that made temporary bans in the past\nCountries where TikTok is banned\nCountries where TikTok is banned, but use a local version of the app (Douyin)\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\nAs of August 2023[update], TikTok is reportedly banned in several Asian countries including Afghanistan,[311] Armenia, Azerbaijan, India,[312][313][314] Iran,[315] Kyrgyzstan,[316] Nepal,[317] and Syria. The app was previously banned temporarily in Indonesia,[318] but has been lifted.\n\n\nWith reports that Palestinians resorted to TikTok for promoting their cause after platforms like Facebook and Twitter blocked their content,[319] Israeli analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem called the app a \"tool of dangerous influence\" inciting violence against Israelis.[320][321] According to Ynet, the Palestinian militant group Lion's Den gained much of their popularity through TikTok.[322] In February 2023, Otzma Yehudit politician Almog Cohen advocated blocking TikTok for all of East Jerusalem.[323]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2023, Nepali officials prohibited TikTok citing its disruption of social structures within the South Asian nation.[324]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, the Canadian government banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices.[325]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, the European Commission and European Council banned TikTok from official devices.[326][327]\n\n\n\n#### Belgium[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Belgium banned TikTok from all federal government work devices over cybersecurity, privacy, and misinformation concerns.[328]\n\n\n\n#### Denmark[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Denmark's Ministry of Defence banned TikTok on work devices.[329]\n\n\n\n#### France[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2023, members of the French parliament recommended a general ban of TikTok unless it were to \"come clean\". Concerns ranged from the company's ownership structure, the effectiveness of the app's content moderation and age limits. Government officials also blamed TikTok and other social media platforms for the riots that ensued after the police shooting of Nahel Merzouk. The recommendation was non-binding.[330]\n\n\n\n#### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, the UK government announced that TikTok would be banned on work devices used by ministers and other employees, amid security concerns relating to the app's handling of user data. Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence can continue to use the app under some exempting circumstances.[331] The same month, the BBC told all employees to delete TikTok off their devices unless the app was being used for work purposes. The network is also reportedly considering a ban on the app.[332]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Restrictions on TikTok in the United States\n\nIn January 2020, the United States Army and Navy banned TikTok on government devices after the Defense Department labeled it a security risk. Recruitors had been using the app to help fill quotas, and some continue to maintain a level of engagement through their personal accounts.[333][334][335]\n\n\nAccording to a 2020 article in *The New York Times*, CIA analysts determined that while it is possible the Chinese government could obtain user information from the app, there was no evidence it had done so.[336] Several independent cybersecurity experts have also concluded that there is no determinable evidence that user information was being or had been obtained by the Chinese government, although they note that the amount of data that the app collects is of comparable volume to other social media apps, including U.S.-based platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.[337][338]\n\n\nOn 6 August 2020, then U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order[339][340] which would ban TikTok transactions in 45 days if it was not sold by ByteDance. Trump also signed a similar order against the WeChat application owned by the Chinese multinational company Tencent.[341][342]\n\n\nOn 14 August 2020, Trump issued another order[343][344] giving ByteDance 90 days to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business.[345] In the order, Trump said that there is \"credible evidence\" that leads him to believe that ByteDance \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States\".[346] Donald Trump was concerned about TikTok being a threat because TikTok's parent company was rumored to be taking United States user data and reporting it back to Chinese operations through the company ByteDance.[347]\n\n\nIn June 2021, new president Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the Trump administration ban on TikTok, and instead ordered the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the app to determine if it poses a threat to U.S. national security.[348]\n\n\nIn June 2022, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr called for Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores, citing national security concerns, saying TikTok \"harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show are being accessed in Beijing\".[349][350]\n\n\nIn September 2022, during a testimony to the Senate Homeland Security Committee, TikTok's COO would not commit to stopping \"all data and metadata flows\" to China. The COO reacted to concerns of the company's handling of user data by stating that TikTok does not operate in China, though the company does have an office there.[351]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Christopher A. Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told U.S. lawmakers that \"the Chinese government could use [TikTok] to control data collection on millions of users or control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations\".[352]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Senator Marco Rubio and representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced the *Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act* (ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act), which would prohibit Chinese- and Russian-owned social networks from doing business in the United States.[353][354] That month, Senator Josh Hawley also introduced a separate measure, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, to ban federal employees from using TikTok on all government devices.[355] On 15 December, Hawley's measure was unanimously passed by the U.S. Senate.[356] On 27 December, the Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives banned TikTok from all devices managed by the House of Representatives.[357]\n\n\nAs of February 2023,[358][359] at least 32 (of 50) states have announced or enacted bans on state government agencies, employees, and contractors using TikTok on government-issued devices. State bans only affect government employees and do not prohibit civilians from having or using the app on their personal devices.\n\n\nIn March 2023, *Politico* reported that TikTok hired SKDK to lobby amid a possible federal ban.[360] This preceded TikTok's CEO appearance before Congress to address the concerns surrounding the app. He stated that TikTok's data collection practices did not differ from those of other US social media platforms.[361] A researcher at the Citizen Lab believes that governments around the world should better protect user information in general from being exploited by Big Tech, not focus exclusively on one app.[279]\n\n\nMontana became the first state to pass legislation banning TikTok on all personal devices from operating within state lines and barring app stores from offering TikTok for downloads.[362][363][364] State governor Greg Gianforte signed the bill in May 2023 with the law going into effect in January 2024.[362][363][365] TikTok is paying the attorney fees for a lawsuit from Montana content creators who had expressed concerns about the legislation. The company is filing a separate case on its own behalf to overturn the ban.[366]\n\n\n\n#### Commentary[edit]\n\n\nSecurity officials have few details to offer about the move against TikTok.[15]\n\n\nAttempts to ban TikTok by the United States have been regarded as hypocritical and politically motivated. The U.S. is headquarters to major global Internet companies, and its intelligence agencies such as the NSA can broadly interpret Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to search user communications even without a warrant. Non-US persons are more easily targeted, numbering 232,432 in 2021, but US citizens' communications can also be caught up.[367]\n\n\nThe types of data collected by TikTok are also collected by other social media platforms and available for purchase through brokers, often without oversight, by both private and state entities.[367] A researcher at Georgia Tech's Internet Governance Project raised the question of whether protectionism of U.S. corporations, rather than privacy concerns, is the primary motivation of the US government. An analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies writes that it would make more sense to focus on the protection of data directly rather than on any particular platform.[368]\n\n\n\n#### Project Texas[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Trump administration's attempt to ban the platform, TikTok has been working to silo privileged user data within the United States under oversight from the US government or a third party such as Oracle.[279] Named Project Texas, the initiative focuses on unauthorized access, state influence, and software security. A new subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc. (USDS), was created to manage user data, software code, back-end systems, and content moderation. It would report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), not ByteDance or TikTok, even for hiring practices. Oracle would review and spot check the data flows through USDS. It would also digitally sign software code, approve updates, and oversee content moderation and recommendation. Physical locations would be established so that Oracle and the US government could conduct their own reviews.[369] The company has been engaged in confidential negotiations over the project with CFIUS since 2021 and submitted its proposal but received little response from the panel afterward.[370]\n\n\nIn March 2023, a former employee of the company said Project Texas did not go far enough and that a complete \"re-engineering\" would be needed. TikTok responded by saying that Project Texas already is a re-engineering of the app and that the former employee left in 2022 before the project specifications were finalized.[371]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\nBy 7 March 2023, 68 Australian federal agencies had banned TikTok on work-related mobile devices. Liberal Party Senator James Paterson called for a federal ban on all government-related devices.[372] In April, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan banned TikTok from government phones.[373]\n\n\nOn 17 March 2023, the New Zealand Parliamentary Service banned TikTok on devices connected to Parliament, citing cybersecurity concerns.[374][375]\n\n\n\n## Other legal issues[edit]\n\n\nSome countries have shown concerns regarding the content on TikTok, as their cultures view it as obscene, immoral, vulgar, and encouraging pornography. There have been temporary blocks and warnings issued by countries including Indonesia,[376] Bangladesh,[377] India,[378] and Pakistan[379][380] over the content concerns. In 2018, Douyin was reprimanded by Chinese media watchdogs for showing \"unacceptable\" content.[381]\n\n\nOn 27 July 2020, Egypt sentenced five women to two years in prison over TikTok videos. One of the women had encouraged other women to try and earn money on the platform, another woman was sent to prison for dancing. The court also imposed a fine of 300,000 Egyptian pounds (UK\u00a314,600) on each defendant.[382]\n\n\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed lawsuits against TikTok, alleging that the platform exposed inappropriate content to minors. The complaint also alleges that TikTok \"intentionally falsely reports the frequency of sexual content, nudity, and mature/suggestive themes\" on their platform which made the app's \"12-plus\" age ratings on the Apple and Google app stores deceptive.[383][384]\n\n\n\n### Tencent lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nTencent's WeChat platform has been accused of blocking Douyin's videos.[385][386] In April 2018, Douyin sued Tencent and accused it of spreading false and damaging information on its WeChat platform, demanding CN\u00a51 million in compensation and an apology. In June 2018, Tencent filed a lawsuit against Toutiao and Douyin in a Beijing court, alleging they had repeatedly defamed Tencent with negative news and damaged its reputation, seeking a nominal sum of CN\u00a51 in compensation and a public apology.[387] In response, Toutiao filed a complaint the following day against Tencent for allegedly unfair competition and asking for CN\u00a590\u00a0million in economic losses.[388]\n\n\n\n### Data transfer class action lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2019, a class action lawsuit was filed in California that alleged that TikTok transferred personally identifiable information of U.S. persons to servers located in China owned by Tencent and Alibaba.[389][390][391] The lawsuit also accused ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, of taking user content without their permission. The plaintiff of the lawsuit, college student Misty Hong, downloaded the app but said she never created an account. She realized a few months later that TikTok had created an account for her using her information (such as biometrics) and made a summary of her information. The lawsuit also alleged that information was sent to Chinese tech giant Baidu.[392] In July 2020, twenty lawsuits against TikTok were merged into a single class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.[393] In February 2021, TikTok agreed to pay $92 million to settle the class action lawsuit.[394]\n\n\n\n### Voice actor lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Canadian voice actor Bev Standing filed a lawsuit against TikTok over the use of her voice in the text-to-speech feature without her permission. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York. TikTok declined to comment. Standing believes that TikTok used recordings she made for the Chinese government-run Institute of Acoustics.[395] The voice used in the feature was subsequently changed.[396]\n\n\n\n### Market Information Research Foundation lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the Netherlands-based Market Information Research Foundation (SOMI) filed a \u20ac1.4 billion lawsuit on behalf of Dutch parents against TikTok, alleging that the app gathers data on children without adequate permission.[397]\n\n\n\n### Blackout Challenge lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nMultiple lawsuits have been filed against TikTok, accusing the platform of hosting content that led to the death of at least seven children.[398] The lawsuits claim that children died after attempting the \"Blackout challenge\", a TikTok trend that involves strangling or asphyxiating someone or themselves until they black out (passing out). TikTok stated that search queries for the challenge do not show any results, linking instead to protective resources, while the parents of two of the deceased argued that the content showed up on their children's TikTok feeds, without them searching for it.[399]\n\n\n\n### Cooperation with law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2023 *The New Zealand Herald* reported that TikTok, working in cooperation with both New Zealand and Australian police, deleted 340 accounts and 2,000 videos associated with criminal gangs including the Mongrel Mob, Black Power, Killer Beez, the Comancheros, Mongols, and Rebels. TikTok had earlier drawn criticism for hosting content by organised crime groups promoting the gang lifestyle and fights. A TikTok spokesperon reiterated the platform's efforts to countering \"violent\" and \"hateful\" organisations' content and cooperating with police. New Zealand Police Commissioner Andrew Coster praised the platform for taking a \"socially-responsible stance\" against gangs.[400]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of most-followed TikTok accounts\n* Musical.ly\n* Timeline of social media\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Strictly legal explainers are still available on topics such as same-sex marriage.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"TikTok \u2013 Make Your Day\". iTunes Store.
