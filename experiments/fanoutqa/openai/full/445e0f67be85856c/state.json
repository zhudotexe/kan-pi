Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Robertson, Patrick (1991). *Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats* (4\u00a0ed.).

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"The Fate of the Furious (2017)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"All Time Worldwide Box Office\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2\u00a0billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2\u00a0billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345\u00a0million from the sale of sixteen\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3\u00a0billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"The Empire Strikes Back\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bialik, Carl (December 17, 2007). \"Box-Office Records Are the Stuff of 'Legend'\". *The Wall Street Journal*.

The prints were battered, but the studio believed one final fling for GWTW was possible. The film returned to movie theaters for the third time in the spring of 1942 and stayed in release until late 1943 ... When MGM finally pulled the film from exhibition, all worn-out prints were destroyed, and GWTW was at last declared out of circulation. MGM, which by then had sole ownership of the film, announced that GWTW had grossed over $32\u00a0million.\n87. **^** Dick, Bernard F.

Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate.

Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *From Russia With Love*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 78.9; Production Cost: 2.0 (in millions of $s)\"\n\t* *Goldfinger*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 124.9; Production Cost: 3.0 (in millions of $s)\"\n\t* *Diamonds Are Forever*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 116; Production Cost: 7.2 (in millions of $s)\"\n\t* *Moonraker*: \"Worldwide Box Office: 210.3; Production Cost: 34.0 (in millions of $s)\"\n215. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Chapman, James (2007). *Licence to thrill: a cultural history of the James Bond films*.

It was the most popular film of the year (from any studio) in both North America and Britain, and its foreign earnings were three times higher than those of any other MGM film released in the 1941\u201342 season. The production cost ($1,344,000) was one of the highest of the season, indicating the studio never thought of the film as a potential loss-maker. When the film earned a worldwide gross of $8,878,000, MGM had the highest profit ($4,831,000) in its history. *Random Harvest* nearly matched the success of *Mrs Miniver* with worldwide earnings of $8,147,000 yielding the second-highest profit in MGM's history ($4,384,000). *Random Harvest* was also the most popular film of the year in Britain, where it proved to be even more popular than Britain's most acclaimed war film, *In Which We Serve*.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Ben-Hur (1959) \u2013 Notes\".

price inflation up to 2020 levels, based on data from Box Office Mojo, which was last updated in 2019 based on an average domestic movie ticket price of $9.01, and applying the Template:Inflation for the following years up to 2022 levels, due to the lack of updates on the original source.[7] It was compiled by multiplying the average ticket price in the current year by an estimate of the total number of admissions. Where the number of admissions is unknown, they are estimated by dividing the nominal gross by the average ticket price in the year of release to provide an estimate (taking re-releases into account).[8] Admissions better reflect the popularity of older films, since they are less susceptible to the effects of inflation.\n\n\nMany of the films on this list were released prior to the availability of home video and have had multiple releases.\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n| Rank\n

referential adjusted gross for a film,[*original research?*] since doing so would have to take into account most (or all) of the following:\n\n\n\n* Box office gross on *initial* release\n* Ticket price at time of release, or its relative price to other commodities in a given year,[10] in relation to general inflation and gross domestic product.[13]\n* economic conditions that may help or hurt the entertainment industry as a whole (theaters in 2008 lowered ticket prices to attract more viewers though the average ticket cost $7.00)[10]\n* Population at time of release\u2014to be used to calculate:\n* Availability of films (number of theaters and screens, number of prints)\n* Competition of other media (television, internet, home video, film piracy)[10]\n* Total number of films in the marketplace at a given time[10]\n* Screen quotas (no influence on U.S. box office)\n* Price differences: matinee and evening tickets,[14] roadshow tickets,[14] or difference between rural and urban cinemas[13]\n* Length of release (number of weeks)[14]\n\n\nFurther explanation of issues with calculating an adjusted gross can be found in the article for List of highest-grossing films.\n\n\n\n##

Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 \u2021 | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 \u2021 |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n\u2021Includes revenue from re-releases.

Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** Robertson, Patrick (1991). *Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats* (4\u00a0ed.).

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"All Time Worldwide Box Office\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 14\n | *Avatar* | $5,243,956,307\n | 2\n | $2,621,978,154\n | *Avatar* ($2,923,706,026)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avatar* (2009) | $2,923,706,026 |\n| 2\n | *The Way of Water* (2022) | $2,320,250,281\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15\n | *Despicable Me* | $4,647,796,993\n | 5\n | $929,559,399\n | *Minions* ($1,159,444,662)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Main series | $2,548,724,121\n | 3\n | $849,574,707\n | *Despicable Me 3* ($1,034,800,131)\n |\n| 1\n | *Despicable Me 3* (2017) | $1,034,800,131 |\n| 2\n | *Despicable Me 2* (2013) | $970,766,005 |\n| 3\n | *Despicable Me* (2010) | $543,157,985\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Minions* series | $2,099,072,872\n | 2\n | $1,049,536,436\n | *Minions* ($1,159,444,662)\n |\n| 1\n | *Minions* (2015) | $1,159,444,662 |\n| 2\n | *The Rise of Gru* (2022) | $939,628,210\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000\u20138,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000\u20139,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) \u2013 International Box Office Results: Germany\". *Box Office Mojo*.

There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 19\n | *The Twilight Saga* | $3,359,862,915\n | 5\n | $671,972,583\n | *Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2* ($829,746,820)\n |\n| 1\n | *Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2* (2012) | $829,746,820 |\n| 2\n | *Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1* (2011) | $712,205,856 |\n| 3\n | *New Moon* (2009) | $709,827,462 |\n| 4\n | *Eclipse* (2010) | $698,509,825 |\n| 5\n | *Twilight* (2008) | $407,187,715 |\n| 6\n | *Twilight / New Moon Combo* (2010) | $2,385,237\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 20\n | *Toy Story* | $3,270,004,838\n | 5\n | $654,000,968\n | *Toy Story 4* ($1,073,394,593)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Main series | $3,043,579,418\n | 4\n | $760,894,855\n | *Toy Story 4* ($1,073,394,593)\n |\n| 1\n | *Toy Story 4* (2019) | $1,073,394,593 |\n| 2\n | *Toy Story 3* (2010) | $1,066,970,811 |\n| 3\n | *Toy Story 2* (1999) | $497,375,381 |\n| 4\n | *Toy Story* (1995) | $373,554,033 |\n| 5\n | *Toy Story/Toy Story 2 (3D)* (2009) | $32,284,600\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to 2000, only seven film series had grossed over $1\u00a0billion at the box office: *James Bond*,[98] *Star Wars*,[99] *Indiana Jones*,[100] *Rocky*,[101][102][103] *Batman*,[104] *Jurassic Park*,[105] and *Star Trek*.[106] Since the turn of the century, that number has increased to over ninety (not including one-off hits such as *Titanic* and *Zootopia*).[107] This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but it is also due to Hollywood's adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition such as being based on a well-known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ animated\n* Vietnam\n |\n| By person | * Actors\n* Directors\n* Producers\n |\n\n |\n| Records | * *Avatar*\n* *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n* *Avengers: Infinity War*\n* *Avengers: Endgame*\n |\n| Awards | * Box Office Entertainment Awards\n* Crystal Film\n* Diamond Film\n* Golden Film\n\t+ recipients\n* Golden Screen Award\n* Goldene Leinwand\n* Platinum Film\n\t+ recipients\n |\n| Websites | * *Box Office Mojo*\n* *The Numbers*\n* *ShowBIZ Data*\n* *Box Office India*\n |\n| Other | * Box office futures\n* Box Office Poison\n* *Boxoffice Pro*\n* *Film Business Asia*\n |\n| Related | * Blockbuster\n* 100 Crore Club\n* Best-selling films in the United States\n* Highest-grossing media franchises\n* Highest-grossing musical theatre productions\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n198. **^** Block & Wilson 2010\n\n\t* p. 382 Archived April 3, 2023, at the Wayback Machine. \"Production Cost: $2.4 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s)\"\n\t* Burns, Douglas (2010), *Mister Roberts*, p.\u00a0383, *Mister Roberts* sailed onto movie screens buoyed by enthusiastic reviews and receptive audiences.

Where specific rentals data are reported in *Variety* before this (which tended to be only sporadically) they were often for worldwide rather domestic performance.

Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Samson and Delilah* (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences,[44] with *Quo Vadis*, *The Robe*, *The Ten Commandments*, *Ben-Hur* and *Spartacus* all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures.[45] The success of *White Christmas* and *South Pacific* in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with *West Side Story*, *Mary Poppins*, *My Fair Lady*, *The Sound of Music* and *Funny Girl* all among the top films of the decade.

Distributor rentals: It is also important to know and recognize the difference between the distributor's gross receipts and the gross rentals. The term \"rentals\" refers to the aggregate amount of the film distributor's share of monies paid at theatre box offices computed on the basis of negotiated agreements between the distributor and the exhibitor. Note that gross receipts refers to amounts actually received and from all markets and media, whereas gross rentals refers to amounts earned from theatrical exhibition only, regardless of whether received by the distributor. Thus, gross receipts is the much broader term and includes distributor rentals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Ben-Hur (1959) \u2013 Notes\". Turner Classic Movies.

It signifies the material appearance or incarnation of a powerful deity, or spirit on Earth.[1][2] The relative verb to \"alight, to make one's appearance\" is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being.[3][4]\n\n\nThe word *avatar* does not appear in the Vedic literature;[5] however, it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE.[6] Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The *Rigveda* describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will.[7][8] The *Bhagavad Gita* expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than *avatar*.[6][4]\n\n\nTheologically, the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu, though the idea has been applied to other deities.[9] Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten Dashavatara of the *Garuda Purana* and the twenty-two avatars in the *Bhagavata Purana*, though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable.[10] The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology. In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari, Durga, Chandi, Chamunda, Mahakali, and Kali are commonly found.[11][12][13] While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.[14] The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.[15][16]\n\n\nIncarnation concepts that are in some aspects similar to *avatar* are also found in Buddhism,[17] Christianity,[5] and other religions.[17]\n\n\nThe scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses, but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev, that formless eternal god is within the human heart, and man is his own savior.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and meaning[edit]\n\n\nThe Sanskrit noun (**avat\u0101ra**, Hindustani: [\u0259\u028b\u02c8ta\u02d0r]) is derived from the Sanskrit prefix *ava-* (down) and the root **t\u1e5b** (to cross over).[20] These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to *-taritum*, *-tarati*, *-r\u012btum*.[3]\n\n\n*Avatar* means \"descent, alight, to make one's appearance\",[3] and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.[20] The word also implies \"to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something\".[3] In Hindu traditions, the \"crossing or coming down\" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from \"eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude\".[5] An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a *saguna* (with form, attributes) embodiment of the *nirguna* Brahman or Atman (soul).[21] Avatar, according to \nBhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati actually means 'Divine Descent' in his commentaries of The Shrimad Bhagavatam and The Bramha Samhita (mentioned in Brahmavaivarta Purana).\n\n\nNeither the Vedas nor the Principal Upanishads ever mention the word *avatar* as a noun.[5] The verb roots and form, such as *avatarana*, appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as \"action of descending\", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).[22] The related verb *avatarana* is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as \"laying down the burden of man\" suffering from the forces of evil.[22]\n\n\nThe term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god Vishnu.[1][3] The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to establish Dharma on Earth, uses other terms such as the word *sambhav\u0101mi* in verse 4.6 and the word *tanu* in verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita,[4] as well as other words such as *akriti* and *rupa* elsewhere.[23] It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.[6] The idea proliferates thereafter, in the Puranic stories for many deities, and with ideas such as *ansha-avatar* or partial embodiments.[4][1]\n\n\nThe term *avatar*, in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas.[20] In some contexts, the term *avatara* just means a \"landing place, site of sacred pilgrimage\", or just \"achieve one's goals after effort\", or retranslation of a text in another language.[3] The term *avatar* is not unique to Hinduism even though the term originated with Hinduism. It is found in the *Trikaya* doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.[17]\n\n\n\n### Avatar versus incarnation[edit]\n\n\nThe manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an incarnation.[24] The translation of avatar as \"incarnation\" has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.[25][26] The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in Christology, presents the Christian concept of incarnation. The term avatar in Hinduism refers to act of various gods taking form to perform a particular task which in most of the times is bringing dharma back. The concept of avatar is widely accepted all over the India.[27] Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.[28][note 1] Avatars are embodiments of spiritual perfection, driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism.[28] The concept of the avatar in Hinduism is not incompatible with natural conception through a sexual act, which is again different from the Christian concept of the Virgin Birth.\n\n\n\n### As a loanword[edit]\n\n\nFollowing 19th Century Western interest in Indian culture and Hinduism, the word \"Avatar\" was taken as loanword into English and other Western languages, where it is used in various contexts and meanings, often considerably different from its original meaning in Hinduism - see Avatar (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Vishnu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vishnu\n\nThe concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring Dharma. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as \"Hindu\", but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold.[30] An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:[9][26]\n\n\n\n\n> Arjuna, whenever righteousness is on the decline, unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.  \n> \n> For the protection of the virtuous, for the extirpation of evil-doers, & for establishing Dharma (righteousness) on a firm footing, I manifest Myself from age to age.\n> \u2014\u200aBhagavad Gita 4.7\u20138\n> \n\n\nThe Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.[31] The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.[31]\n\n\nThe most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.[26] The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.[32]\n\n\n\n### Dashavatara[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dashavatara\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations, the Dashavatara, are celebrated therein as his major appearances.[10][26] The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the Agni Purana, the Garuda Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.[33][34]\n\n\nThe ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the *Dashavatara* (a Sanskrit compound meaning \"ten avatars\"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avatars of Vishnu\n| Name\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Matsya | The fish avatar. He saves Manu and the seven sages from the cosmic flood, and in some traditions, saves the Vedas from an asura called Hayagriva.[36] |\n| Kurma[note 2] | The tortoise/turtle avatar. He supports the mountain named Mandara while the devas and the asuras churn the ocean of milk to produce the nectar of immortality.[38] |\n| Varaha | The boar avatar. He rescues Bhumi, the goddess of the earth, when the asura Hiranyaksha abducts her, restoring her rightful place in the universe.[39] |\n| Narasimha | The lion avatar.

He incarnates to bring an end to the present age of corruption called the Kali Yuga, re-establishing the four classes and law to the world.[47] |\n\n\n### Longer alternatives[edit]\n\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana also goes on to give an alternate list, wherein it numerically lists out 23 Vishnu avatars in chapter 1.3.[48]\n\n\n\n1. Four Kumaras (Catu\u1e25sana): the four sons of Brahma who exemplify the path of devotion.\n2. Varaha: The boar avatar. He rescues Bhumi, the goddess of the earth, when the asura Hiranyaksha abducts her, restoring her rightful place in the universe.[39]\n3. Narada: the divine-sage who travels the worlds as a devotee of Vishnu.\n4. Nara-Narayana: the twin-sages.\n5. Kapila: a renowned sage spoken of in the Mahabharata, son of Kardama and Devahuti.

One approach was to identify full avatars and partial avatars. Krishna, Rama, and Narasimha were full avatars (*purna avatars*), while others were partial avatars (*ansha avatars*).[29] Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an *avatar* of Vishnu.[29] The Pancharatra text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatars include those that are direct and complete (*sakshad*), indirect and endowed (*avesha*), cosmic and salvific (*vyuha*), inner and inspirational (*antaryamin*), consecrated and in the form of image (*archa*).[29]\n\n\nYet another classification, developed in Krishna schools, centers around *Guna-avatars*, *Purusha-avatars* and *Lila-avatars*, with their subtypes.[53][54] The *Guna-avatar* classification of *avatars* is based on the Gu\u1e47as concept of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, that is Rajas (Brahma), Sattva (Vishnu), and Tamas (Shiva).[53][54] These personalities of the Trimurti are referred to as *Guna avatars*.[53] The *Purushavatara* are three. The first evolves all matter (Prakriti), the second is the soul present in each individual creature, the third is the interconnected oneness or Brahman that connects all souls.[53][55] The *Lilavataras* are partial or full manifestations of Vishnu, where either some powers (Shakti) or material parts of him exist.[53][54]\n\n\nVishnu is Purushavatara.[56][57] The Matsya, Kurma, and Vamana avatars of Vishnu are Lilavataras.[54][56] A *Purnarupa* in this classification, is when Vishnu manifests completely along with his qualities and powers. In Bengal Vaishnavism, Krishna is the *Purnarupa*.[53] In Shaivism, Bhairava is the purnarupa of Shiva.[58]\n\n\n\n### In Sikhism[edit]\n\n\n24 avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in Bachitar Natak's composition in Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhism written by Guru Gobind Singh:[59]\n\n\n\n1. Mach (Matsya)\n2. Kach (Kurma)\n3. Nara (Nara in Nara-Narayana)\n4. Narayan (Narayana in Nara-Narayana)\n5. Maha Mohini (Mohini)\n6. Bairaha (Varaha)\n7. Nar Singha (Narasimha)\n8. Baman (Vamana)\n9. Parshuram (Parashurama)\n10. Bramma (Brahma)\n11. Balram (Balarama)\n12. Jalandhar (Jalandhara)\n13. Bishan (Vishnu)\n14. Sheshayi (Shesha)\n15. Arihant Dev (Arihanta)\n16. Manu Raja (Manu)\n17. Dhanvantari (Dhanvantari)\n18. Suraj (Surya)\n19. Chandar (Chandra)\n20. Ram (Rama)\n21. Kishan (Krishna)\n22. Nar (Arjuna)\n23. Rudra (Shiv)\n24. Kalki (Kalki)\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib reverentially includes the names of numerous Hindu deities, including Vishnu avatars such as Krishna, Hari, and Rama, as well those of Devi as Durga.[60][61][62]\n\n\nDasam Granth has three major compositions, one each dedicated to avatars of Vishnu (Chaubis avatar) and Brahma.[59][63] However, Sikhism rejects the doctrine of savior incarnation, and only accepts the abstract *nirguna* formless god.[18][64] The Sikh Gurus endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev (\u22481270 \u2013 1350 CE) that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior.[18][65]\n\n\n\n### In Isma'ilism[edit]\n\n\nThe Gupti Ismailis, who observe pious circumspection as Hindus, uphold that the first Shi\u2018i Imam, \u2018Ali b. Abi Talib, as well as his descendants through the line of Isma\u2018il, are collectively Kalki, the tenth and final *avat\u0101ra* of Vishnu. According to this interpretation, these figures represent the continuity of divine guidance to humankind. In the view of some Guptis, this is corroborated by the Quranic verse 14:4 which mentions the idea that God had sent a messenger to every land. They understand the *avat\u0101ras* to be these messengers sent by God to their people in the Indian subcontinent.[66]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Shiva[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sharabha (right) with Narasimha (18th-century painting, Pahari/Kangra School)\nAlthough Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the avatar doctrine is neither universally accepted nor commonly adopted in Shaivism.[67] The views on the doctrine of incarnation has been one of the significant doctrinal differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism, in addition to their differences on the role of householder life versus monastic life for spiritual release.[15][16][68] Shaivism is a transcendental theology, where man, with the help of his Guru, is his own savior.[68]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana lists twenty-eight avatars of Shiva.[69] In the Shiva Purana there is a distinctly Saivite version of a traditional avatar myth: Shiva brings forth Virabhadra, one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu. When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird Sharabha which calms down lion-man Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, and Shiva then gives Vishnu a chakra (not to be confused with Sudarshan Chakra) as gift. A similar story is told in the late medieval era Sharabha Upanishad.[70] However, Vaishnava Dvaita school refutes this Shaivite view of Narasimha.[71] According to the Shiva Purana, Lord Shiva has 19 avatars. According to the Kurma Purana, he has 28.\n\n\nThe vanara god Hanuman who helped Rama (the Vishnu avatar) is considered by some to be the eleventh avatar of Rudra (Shiva).[72][73] Some regional deities like Khandoba are also believed by some to be avatars of Shiva.[74][75]\nAshwatthama, the son of Drona is also considered to be an Avatar of Lord Shiva.\n\n\nShesha and his avatars (Balarama and Lakshmana) are occasionally linked to Shiva.[76][77][78][79] Adi Shankara, the formulator of Advaita Vedanta, is also occasionally regarded as an avatar of Shiva.[80]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.[81]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Devis[edit]\n\n\n![An 18th century painting of the goddess Durga fighting Mahishasura](image)\n![A ca. 1910 chromolithograph of Kali trampling Shiva by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![An early 20th century chromolithograph of Sita in exile by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![The Hindu deity Parvati, 1050-1100 AD India](image)\nAvatars of Devi. Clockwise from upper left: Durga, Kali, Parvati and Sita.\n\nAvatars are also observed in Shaktism, the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (Devi), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous as \u2013 much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the avatars of Vishnu.[82]\n\n\nNilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana\u00a0\u2013 which includes the Devi Gita\u00a0\u2013 says that various avatars of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama\u00a0\u2013 generally thought to be Vishnu's avatars.[83] Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati are main goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.[84]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Parvati[edit]\n\n\nDevi is popular in her form as Parvati. In Devi Mahatmya she is seen as the Goddess Mahakali, and in Uma Samhita, she is seen as Devi herself. Regarding her incarnations, it varies per sect in Hinduism. She could be all Goddesses as said in Shaivism and some main Shatism interpretations like the Sri kula and Kali Kula families, or just a form of Devi in some other Shaktism interpretations and many Vaishnava interpretations. With this in mind, Parvati's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahakali\n* Sati\n* Mahavidyas- Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi\n* The 64 Shakti Peethas\n* Navadurgas - Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri\n* Annapurna\n* Kaushiki\n* Durga\n* Shitala\n* Maheshwari\n* Ardhanarishvara\n* Vindhyavasini\n* Bhramari\n* Shakambhari\n* Raktadantika\n* Twarita\n* In North India- Khodiyar, Bahuchara Mata, Naina Devi, Jwala etc.\n* In Western India- Bhavani, Saptashrungi, Ekvira, Amba etc.\n* In East India-Dakshina Kali, Kamakhya, Jagadhatri etc.\n* In South India- Meenakshi, Vishalakshi, Kamakshi, Abhirami, Mookambika, Akilandeswari, Mariamman, Karumariamman etc.\n\n\nAll of these incarnations helped provide security to the world and even brought Shiva into the participation of worldly affairs.[85]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Lakshmi[edit]\n\n\nLike Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as in many forms to help provide order and to enlighten the world with her consort. She has many forms, and just like Parvati, some of her forms are not consistent throughout all sects and interpretations of Hinduism. In Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, Lakshmi is seen as Devi herself. She could be every Goddess as said in Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, or just another form of Devi as seen in other interpretations of Shaktism and in Shaivism. With this in mind, Lakshmi's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahalakshmi\n* At 108 Divya Desam\n* Ashtalakshmi - Adi Lakshmi, Dhanya Lakshmi, Dhana Lakshmi, Gaja Lakshmi, Santana Lakshmi, Vidya Lakshmi, Veera Lakshmi, Vijaya Lakshmi\n* With avatars of Vishnu - Sita, Radha, Gopi, Rukmini, Ashtabharya, Junior wives of Krishna, Padmavathi, Lakshmi Narayana, Andal, Dharini\n* Singular forms - Vedavati, Chottanikkara Bhagavathy, Mookambika devi, Vaishno Devi, As Kolhapur ambabai\n* Matrikas - Vaishnavi, Varahi, Narasimhi\n* Wives of Vishnu - Sri, Bhumi, Nila\n* Mahavidya Kamalatmika\n\n\n## Avatars of Brahma[edit]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, second scriptures of Sikhs written by Guru Gobind Singh, mentioned seven Brahma Avatars.[86]\n\n\n\n1. Valmiki\n2. Kashyapa\n3. Shukra\n4. Baches\n5. Vyasa\n6. Khat\n7. Kalidasa\n\n\nKhat avatar in this list refers to six different scholars who are considered to be founders of six schools of Indian philosophy.[87] According to the Skanda Purana, Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Shiva.[88]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Ganesha[edit]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.[89] The two Upapuranas\u00a0\u2013 Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana\u00a0\u2013 detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the Ganapatya sect\u00a0\u2013 exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.\n\n\nFour avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, May\u016bre\u015bvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose\u00a0\u2013 to slay demons.[90]\n\n\nThe Mudgala Puranam describes eight avatars of Ganesha:[91]\n\n\n\n1. Vakratunda (*Vakratu\u1e47\u1e0da*) (\"twisting trunk\"), his mount is a lion.\n2. Ekadanta (\"single tusk\"), his mount is a mouse.\n3. Mahodara (\"big belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n4. Gajavaktra (or Gaj\u0101nana) (\"elephant face\"), his mount is a mouse.\n5. Lambodara (\"pendulous belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n6. Vikata (*Vika\u1e6da*) (\"unusual form\", \"misshapen\"), his mount is a peacock.\n7. Vighnaraja (*Vighnar\u0101ja*) (\"king of obstacles\"), his mount is the celestial serpent *\u015ae\u1e63a*.\n8. Dhumravarna (*Dh\u016bmravar\u1e47a*) (\"grey color\") corresponds to \u015aiva, his mount is a horse.\n\n\n## Avatars of Varuna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jhulelal, incarnation of Varuna\nJhulelal, the I\u1e63\u1e6da-devat\u0101 (most-revered deity) of Sindhi Hindus, is considered the incarnation of Varuna.[92]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Hinduism portal\n* ![](image)Philosophy portal\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n\n\n* Abatur\n* Avatars in the Mahabharata\n* Dashavatara\n* Gautama Buddha in Hinduism\n* Incarnation\n* List of avatar claimants\n* Hindu eschatology\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.[29]\n2. **^** Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu, appears in stories about the Kurma avatar.[37]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** James Lochtefeld (2002), \"Avatar\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, ISBN\u00a00-8239-2287-1, pages 72\u201373\n2. **^** Geoffrey Parrinder (1997). *Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions*.

At the end of the meditation a drop of perspiration was produced from his forehead. That drop, of the shape of a bubble, in a moment fell on the earth. O you of an excellent face, I, having three eyes, a trident, and adorned with the crown of the matted hair, was born from that bubble.

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship.[4] The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.\n\n\nRMS *Titanic* was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three *Olympic*-class ocean liners built for the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. *Titanic* was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nThe first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Turkish bath, and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's operational use. *Titanic* had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as \"unsinkable\".\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats. However, she actually carried only 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while she was sinking (Collapsible A nearly swamped and was filled with a foot of water until rescue; Collapsible B completely overturned while launching). Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people\u2014about half the number of passengers on board, and one-third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nGaumont newsreel containing the only known footage of *Titanic*, 1912\nThe name *Titanic* derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS *Titanic* was the second of the three *Olympic*-class ocean liners\u2014the lead vessel was RMS\u00a0*Olympic* and the final ship in the class was HMHS\u00a0*Britannic*.[5] They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.[6] The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).\n\n\nThe White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, Cunard\u2014which had recently launched *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, the fastest passenger ships then in service\u2014and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury.[7] The White Star Line sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton\u2013Cherbourg\u2013New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, the *Olympic* and *Titanic* would replace RMS\u00a0*Teutonic* of 1889, RMS\u00a0*Majestic* of 1890 as well as RMS\u00a0*Adriatic* of 1907. RMS\u00a0*Oceanic* would remain on the route until the third new ship could be delivered.[*citation needed*] *Majestic* resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service post the loss of *Titanic*'.[8]\n\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.[9] Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.[9] In the case of the *Olympic*-class ships, a cost of \u00a33\u00a0million (approximately \u00a3310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.[10]\n\n\nHarland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing *Olympic*-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.[11] Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment, and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.[b]\n\n\nOn July 29, 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of construction.[14] At this point, the first ship\u2014which was later to become *Olympic*\u2014had no name but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. *Titanic* was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.[15]\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Starboard view of *Titanic*\n*Titanic* was 882\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (269.06\u00a0m) long with a maximum breadth of 92\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (28.19\u00a0m).\n\n\nHer total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32\u00a0m).[16] She measured 46,329\u00a0GRT and 21,831\u00a0NRT[17] and with a draught of 34\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (10.54\u00a0m), she displaced 52,310 tons.[5]\nAll three of the *Olympic*-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:\n\n\n\n* The **boat deck**, on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that *Titanic*'s lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.[18][19]\n* **A Deck**, also called the **promenade deck**, extended along the entire 546 feet (166\u00a0m) length of the superstructure. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, smoke room, reading and writing rooms, and Palm Court.[18]\n* **B Deck**, the **bridge deck**, was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On *Titanic*, the \u00e0 la carte restaurant and the Caf\u00e9 Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings.[c] Aft of the bridge deck was the raised poop deck, 106 feet (32\u00a0m) long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of *Titanic*'s passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by well decks.[20][21]\n* **C Deck**, the **shelter deck**, was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were housed below the poop deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second Class library.[20][22]\n* **D Deck**, the **saloon deck**, was dominated by three large public rooms\u2014the First Class reception room, the First Class dining saloon and the Second Class dining saloon. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second and Third Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).[20][23]\n* **E Deck**, the **upper deck**, was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and trimmers. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed 'Scotland Road', in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.[20][24]\n* **F Deck**, the **middle deck**, was the last complete deck, and mainly accommodated Second and Third Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as were the swimming pool, Turkish bath and kennels.[20][24][25]\n* **G Deck**, the **lower deck**, was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.[20][26]\n* The **orlop decks**, and the **tank top** below that, were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the tank top\u2014the inner bottom of the ship's hull\u2014provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by flights of stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.[20][26]\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)RMS\u00a0*Olympic*'s rudder with central and port wing propellers;[27] the man at the bottom shows scale.[28]\n*Titanic* propulsion was supplied by three main engines\u2014two reciprocating four-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engines and one centrally placed low-pressure Parsons turbine\u2014each driving a propeller. The two reciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000 horsepower (22,000\u00a0kW). The output of the steam turbine was 16,000 horsepower (12,000\u00a0kW).[16] The White Star Line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner, *Laurentic*, where it had been a great success.[29] It provided a good combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an *Olympic*-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*.[30] By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of steam.[31]\n\n\nThe two reciprocating engines were each 63 feet (19\u00a0m) long and weighed 720 tons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons.[30] They were powered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and five single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces.[32] The boilers were 15\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (4.80\u00a0m) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) long, each weighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.[33]\n\n\nThey were fuelled by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in *Titanic*'s bunkers, with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen working around the clock.[34] 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.[35] The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively well,[34] there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.[36]\n\n\nExhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a surface condenser, to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused.[37] The engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of 23.5 feet (7.2\u00a0m).[33] The middle propeller was slightly smaller at 17 feet (5.2\u00a0m) in diameter,[38] and could be stopped but not reversed.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time.[39] Immediately aft of the turbine engine were four 400\u00a0kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide electrical power to the ship, plus two 30\u00a0kW auxiliary generators for emergency use.[40] Their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.[41]\n\n\n*Titanic* lacked a searchlight in accordance with the ban on the use of searchlights in the merchant navy.[42][43]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\n#### Compartments and funnels[edit]\n\n\nThe interiors of the *Olympic*-class ships were subdivided into 16 primary compartments divided by 15 bulkheads that extended above the waterline. Eleven vertically closing watertight doors could seal off the compartments in the event of an emergency.[44] The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and teak, while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated cork to combat condensation.[45] Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted buff with black tops; only three were functional\u2014the aftmost one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes and kitchen ventilation. Two masts, each 155\u00a0ft (47\u00a0m) high, supported derricks for working cargo.\n\n\n\n#### Rudder and steering engines[edit]\n\n\nDue to the size and weight of *Titanic*'s rudder\u2014at 78\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (23.98\u00a0m) high and 15\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (4.65\u00a0m) long, weighing over 100 tons\u2014that it required steering engines to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed, though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short tiller through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.[46] As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam capstans.[47] The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two kedging anchors).[47]\n\n\n\n#### Water, ventilation and heating[edit]\n\n\nThe ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while *Titanic* was in port, but in an emergency, the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Radio communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMarconi Company receiving equipment for a 5-kilowatt ocean liner station (in the picture, the wireless radio room of *Titanic*'s sister ship, *Olympic*)\n![](image)\nThe only known picture of *Titanic*'s wireless radio room, taken by the Catholic priest Francis Browne. Harold Bride is seated at the desk.\n\n*Titanic*'s radiotelegraph equipment (then known as wireless telegraphy) was leased to the White Star Line by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company, which also supplied two of its employees, Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily sending and receiving passenger telegrams (\"marconigrams\"), but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice warnings.[48][49][50]\nThe radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A soundproofed \"Silent Room\", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter and a motor-generator used for producing alternating currents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office. The ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5-kilowatt rotary spark-gap transmitter, with the wireless telegraph call sign MGY, and communication was in Morse code. This transmitter was one of the first Marconi installations to use a rotary spark-gap, which gave *Titanic* a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of 350 miles (304\u00a0nmi; 563\u00a0km). An elevated T-antenna that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was 500\u00a0kHz (600\u00a0m wavelength); however, the equipment could also operate on the \"short\" wavelength of 1,000\u00a0kHz (300\u00a0m wavelength) that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas.[51]\n\n\n\n### Passenger facilities[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First-class facilities of the *Titanic* and Second- and third-class facilities on *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Grand Staircase of *Titanic*\n\nThe passenger facilities aboard *Titanic* aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to *Titanic*'s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a manor house or an English country house.[52]\n\n\n*Titanic* was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high-class hotels\u2014the Ritz Hotel was a reference point\u2014with First Class cabins finished in the Empire style.[52] A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the Renaissance to Louis XV, were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would \"at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore\".[53]\n\n\nAmong the more novel features available to first-class passengers was a 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) deep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, and a Turkish bath which comprised electric bath, steam room, cool room, massage room, and hot room.[53] First-class common rooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated. They included a lounge in the style of the Palace of Versailles, an enormous reception room, a men's smoking room, and a reading and writing room. There was an \u00e0 la carte restaurant in the style of the Ritz Hotel which was run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur Gaspare Gatti.[54] A *Caf\u00e9 Parisien* decorated in the style of a French sidewalk caf\u00e9, complete with ivy-covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the restaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest French *haute cuisine* in the most luxurious of surroundings.[55] There was also a *Verandah Caf\u00e9* where tea and light refreshments were served, that offered grand views of the ocean. At 114\u00a0ft (35\u00a0m) long by 92\u00a0ft (28\u00a0m) wide, the dining saloon on D Deck, designed by Charles Fitzroy Doll, was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600 passengers at a time.[56]\n\n\n\n* ![The Forward First Class Grand Staircase of Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic.

They reflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for trans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities. \n\n\nThe White Star Line had long since broken that mould. As seen aboard *Titanic*, all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and ten passengers.[57]\n\n\nThird Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard *Titanic* comprised the poop deck at the stern, the forward and aft well decks, and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a general room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper-class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.\n\n\nLeisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.[58]\n\n\nOne of *Titanic*'s most distinctive features was her First Class staircase, known as the Grand Staircase or Grand Stairway. Built of solid English oak with a sweeping curve, the staircase descended through seven decks of the ship, between the boat deck to E deck, before terminating in a simplified single flight on F Deck.[59] It was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the stairwell. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls panelled in the William & Mary style and lit by ormolu and crystal light fixtures.[60]\n\n\nAt the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" flanking the clock face.[59] The Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.[61] During the filming of James Cameron's *Titanic* in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.[62]\n\n\n\n### Mail and cargo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*La Circassienne au Bain* by Merry-Joseph Blondel; the most highly valued item of cargo lost on *Titanic*. This image is of a copy.[d]\nAlthough *Titanic* was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a Royal Mail Ship (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the Royal Mail (and also for the United States Post Office Department). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables), 26,800 cubic feet (760\u00a0m3) of space in her holds was allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks (three Americans and two Britons), who worked 13 hours a day, seven days a week, sorting up to 60,000 items daily.[64]\n\n\nThe ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another 19,455 cubic feet (550.9\u00a0m3) was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs, and a 1912 Renault Type CE Coupe de Ville motor car.[65] Despite later myths, the cargo on *Titanic*'s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, exotic minerals or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the *Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam*, was valued at only \u00a3405 (\u00a350,600 today).[66] According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled *La Circassienne au Bain* by French artist Merry-Joseph Blondel. The painting's owner, first-class passenger Mauritz H\u00e5kan Bj\u00f6rnstr\u00f6m-Steffansson, filed a claim for $100,000 (equivalent to $2,300,000 in 2023) in compensation for the loss of the artwork.[63]\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the holds. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.[67]\n\n\n\n### Lifeboats[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lifeboats of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)A collapsible lifeboat with canvas sides\nLike *Olympic*, *Titanic* carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65 people each and four Engelhardt \"collapsible\" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two emergency cutters with a capacity of 40 people each.[68][e] *Olympic* carried at least two collapsible boats on either side of her number one funnel.[69][70] All of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats A and B, connected to davits by ropes. Those on the starboard side were odd-numbered 1\u201315 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered 2\u201316 from bow to stern.[71]\n\n\nBoth cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate use, while collapsible lifeboats C and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats 1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number 1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand.[71] Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.\n\n\n*Titanic* had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle four lifeboats as Carlisle had planned. This gave *Titanic* the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats[72] which would have been enough for 4,000 people\u2014considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178 people, only one-third of *Titanic*'s total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to only carry 16 lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.[68]\n\n\nTherefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required.[73][f] At the time, lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship\u2014not keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore. Had SS\u00a0*Californian* responded to *Titanic*'s distress calls, the lifeboats might have been able to ferry all passengers to safety as planned.[75]\n\n\n\n## Building and preparing the ship[edit]\n\n\n### Construction, launch and fitting-out[edit]\n\n\n![Construction in gantry, bow is seen](image)\nConstruction in gantry, 1909\u201311\n![Launch, 1911; ship with unfinished superstructure](image)\nLaunch, 1911 (unfinished superstructure)\n![Fitting-out, 1911\u201312: Ship is seen in dock](image)\nFitting-out, 1911\u201312\n\nThe sheer size of the *Olympic class* vessels posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size.[76] The ships were constructed on Queen's Island, now known as the Titanic Quarter, in Belfast Harbour. Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing slipways and build two new ones, the largest ever constructed up to that time, to accommodate both ships.[10] Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by Sir William Arrol & Co., a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the Forth Bridge and London's Tower Bridge. The Arrol Gantry stood 228 feet (69\u00a0m) high, was 270 feet (82\u00a0m) wide and 840 feet (260\u00a0m) long, and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.[77]\n\n\nThe construction of *Olympic* and *Titanic* took place virtually in parallel, with *Olympic*'s keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and *Titanic*'s on 31 March 1909.[15] Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder, with the keel acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom 5\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.60\u00a0m) deep supported 300 frames, each between 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) and 36 inches (91\u00a0cm) apart and measuring up to about 66 feet (20\u00a0m) long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.[78]\n\n\nThe 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of rolled steel plate, mostly up to 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide and 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons.[79] Their thickness varied from 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8\u00a0cm).[44] The plates were laid in a clinkered (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were laid in the \"in and out\" fashion, where strake plating was applied in bands (the \"in strakes\") with the gaps covered by the \"out strakes\", overlapping on the edges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc welding methods, ubiquitous in fabrication today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel rivets, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand.[80] In the 1990s some material scientists concluded[81] that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, by the standards of the time, the steel plate's quality was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the metallurgy of steelmaking.[81] As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.[82][83][84][85][86]\n\n\nAmong the last items to be fitted on *Titanic* before the ship's launch were her two side anchors and one centre anchor. The anchors themselves were a challenge to make, with the centre anchor being the largest ever forged by hand and weighing nearly 16 tons. Twenty Clydesdale draught horses were needed to haul the centre anchor by wagon from the Noah Hingley & Sons Ltd forge shop in Netherton, near Dudley, United Kingdom to the Dudley railway station two miles away. From there it was shipped by rail to Fleetwood in Lancashire before being loaded aboard a ship and sent to Belfast.[87]\n\n\nThe work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,[88] safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was carried out without equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, during *Titanic*'s construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them \"severe\", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.[89] Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.[90]\n\n\n*Titanic* was launched at 12:15\u00a0pm on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpont Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.[91][92] Twenty-two tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the River Lagan.[90] In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne.[91] The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.[93]\n\n\nAlthough *Titanic* was virtually identical to the class's lead ship *Olympic*, a few changes were made to distinguish both ships. The most noticeable exterior difference was that *Titanic* (and the third vessel in class, *Britannic*) had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay, and was intended to provide additional shelter to First Class passengers.[94] Extensive changes were made to B Deck on *Titanic* as the promenade space in this deck, which had proven unpopular on *Olympic*, was converted into additional First Class cabins, including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces. The *\u00c0 la Carte* restaurant was also enlarged and the *Caf\u00e9 Parisien*, an entirely new feature which did not exist on *Olympic*, was added. These changes made *Titanic* slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected due to design changes requested by Ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair *Olympic*, which had been in a collision in September 1911. Had *Titanic* been finished earlier, she might well have missed her collision with an iceberg.[90]\n\n\n\n### Sea trials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Titanic* departing Belfast for sea trials on 2 April 1912\n*Titanic*'s sea trials began at 6\u00a0am on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.[95] The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.[96] Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on *Titanic*'s sea trials: Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff, and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.[97]\n\n\nThe sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in Belfast Lough and then in the open waters of the Irish Sea. Over the course of about 12 hours, *Titanic* was driven at different speeds, her turning ability was tested and a \"crash stop\" was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in 850\u00a0yd (777\u00a0m) or 3 minutes and 15 seconds.[98] The ship covered a distance of about 80 nautical miles (92\u00a0mi; 150\u00a0km), averaging 18 knots (21\u00a0mph; 33\u00a0km/h) and reaching a maximum speed of just under 21 knots (24\u00a0mph; 39\u00a0km/h).[99]\n\n\nOn returning to Belfast at about 7\u00a0pm, the surveyor signed an \"Agreement and Account of Voyages and Crew\", valid for 12 months, which declared the ship seaworthy. An hour later, *Titanic* departed Belfast to head to Southampton, a voyage of about 570 nautical miles (660\u00a0mi; 1,060\u00a0km). After a journey lasting about 28 hours, she arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the port's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of her crew.[100]\n\n\n\n## Maiden voyage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Titanic* at Southampton docks, prior to departure\n![](image)\n*Titanic* in Cork harbour, 11 April 1912\n\nBoth *Olympic* and *Titanic* registered Liverpool as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line, as well as Cunard, were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the *Olympic*, most British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, sailed from Liverpool followed by a port of call in Queenstown, Ireland. Since the company's founding in 1845, a vast majority of their operations had taken place from Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star Line established another service from Southampton on England's south coast, which became known as White Star's \"Express Service\". Southampton had many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its proximity to London.[101]\n\n\nIn addition, Southampton, being on the south coast, allowed ships to easily cross the English Channel and make a port of call on the northern coast of France, usually at Cherbourg. This allowed British ships to pick up clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers at Queenstown. The Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run would become so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after World War I. Out of respect for Liverpool, ships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. *Queen Elizabeth 2* was one of the first ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard in 1969.[101]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many trans-Atlantic crossings between Southampton and New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown on westbound runs, returning via Plymouth in England while eastbound. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December 1912 still exists.[102] When the route was established, four ships were assigned to the service. In addition to *Teutonic* and *Majestic*, RMS\u00a0*Oceanic* and the brand new RMS\u00a0*Adriatic* sailed the route. When the *Olympic* entered service in June 1911, she replaced *Teutonic*, which after completing her last run on the service in late April was transferred to the Dominion Line's Canadian service. The following August, *Adriatic* was transferred to White Star Line's main Liverpool-New York service, and in November, *Majestic* was withdrawn from service impending the arrival of *Titanic* in the coming months, and was mothballed as a reserve ship.[103][104]\n\n\nWhite Star Line's initial plans for *Olympic* and *Titanic* on the Southampton run followed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them. Each would sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually leaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New York, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each direction. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey passengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively.[104] The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the \"*White Star Dock*\", had been specially constructed to accommodate the new *Olympic*-class liners, and had opened in 1911.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crew[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crew of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)Edward Smith, captain of *Titanic*, in 1911\n*Titanic* had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.[106] Like other vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton.[107] The process of signing up recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew during *Titanic*'s sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.[108]\n\n\nCaptain Edward John Smith, the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from *Olympic* to take command of *Titanic*.[109] Henry Tingle Wilde also came across from *Olympic* to take the post of chief mate. *Titanic*'s previously designated chief mate and first officer, William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller, were bumped down to the ranks of first and second officer respectively. The original second officer, David Blair, was dropped altogether.[110][g] The third officer was Herbert Pitman, the only deck officer who was not a member of the Royal Naval Reserve. Pitman was the second-to-last surviving officer.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling, with 494.[111] The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.[112] Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.[113] The rest represented a great variety of professions\u2014bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,[113] who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the *Atlantic Daily Bulletin* with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.[48][h]\n\n\nMost of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;[15] in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.[113] A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class *\u00c0 La Carte* Restaurant and the Caf\u00e9 Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight musicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers.[115] Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's \u00a3105 a month (equivalent to \u00a313,100 today) to the \u00a33 10*s* (\u00a3440 today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.[114]\n\n\n\n### Passengers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Animals aboard *Titanic*\n\n![](image)John Jacob Astor IV in 1909. He was the wealthiest person aboard *Titanic*; he did not survive.\n*Titanic*'s passengers numbered approximately 1,317 people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of whom were in Third Class.[116] The ship was considerably under-capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers\u2014833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006 Third Class.[117]\n\n\nUsually, a high-prestige vessel like *Titanic* could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a national coal strike in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before *Titanic* sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. *Titanic* was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as SS\u00a0*City of New York* and RMS\u00a0*Oceanic*, as well as coal that *Olympic* had brought back from a previous voyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.[94]\n\n\nSome of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard *Titanic*, travelling in First Class. Among them (with those who perished marked with a dagger\u2020) were the American millionaire John Jacob Astor IV\u2020 and his wife, Madeleine Force Astor (with John Jacob Astor VI in utero); industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim\u2020; painter and sculptor Francis Davis Millet\u2020; Macy's owner Isidor Straus\u2020 and his wife, Ida\u2020; Denver millionairess Margaret \"Molly\" Brown;[i] Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, couturi\u00e8re Lucy (Lady Duff-Gordon); Lieut. Col. Arthur Peuchen; writer and historian Archibald Gracie; cricketer and businessman John B. Thayer\u2020 with his wife, Marian, and son Jack; George Dunton Widener\u2020 with his wife, Eleanor, and son Harry\u2020; No\u00ebl Leslie, Countess of Rothes; Mr.\u2020 and Mrs. Charles M. Hays; Mr. and Mrs. Henry S. Harper; Mr.\u2020 and Mrs. Walter D. Douglas; Mr.\u2020 and Mrs. George D. Wick; Mr.\u2020 and Mrs. Henry B. Harris; Mr.\u2020 and Mrs. Arthur L. Ryerson; Mr.\u2020 and Mrs.\u2020 Hudson J. C. Allison; Mr. and Mrs. Dickinson Bishop; noted architect Edward Austin Kent\u2020; brewery heir Harry Molson\u2020; tennis players Karl Behr and Dick Williams; author and socialite Helen Churchill Candee; future lawyer and suffragette Elsie Bowerman and her mother Edith; journalist and social reformer William Thomas Stead\u2020; journalist and fashion buyer Edith Rosenbaum, Philadelphia and New York socialite Edith Corse Evans\u2020; wealthy divorc\u00e9e Charlotte Drake Cardeza; French sculptor Paul Chevr\u00e9; author Jacques Futrelle\u2020 with his wife May; silent film actress Dorothy Gibson with her mother Pauline; President of the Swiss Bankverein, Col. Alfons Simonius-Blumer; James A. Hughes's daughter Eloise; banker Robert Williams Daniel; the chairman of the Holland America Line, Johan Reuchlin\u00a0[de]; Arthur Wellington Ross's son John H. Ross; Washington Roebling's nephew Washington A. Roebling II; Andrew Saks's daughter Leila Saks Meyer with her husband Edgar Joseph Meyer\u2020 (son of Marc Eugene Meyer); William A. Clark's nephew Walter M. Clark with his wife, Virginia; a great-great-grandson of soap manufacturer Andrew Pears, Thomas C. Pears, with wife; John S. Pillsbury's honeymooning grandson John P. Snyder and wife Nelle; Dorothy Parker's New York manufacturer uncle Martin Rothschild with his wife, Elizabeth; and many others.[118]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s owner J. P. Morgan was scheduled to travel on the maiden voyage but cancelled at the last minute.[119] Also aboard the ship were the White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay and *Titanic*'s designer Thomas Andrews\u2020, who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship.[120]\n\n\nThe exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various reasons,[121] and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey.[122] Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares from London, Southampton, or Queenstown cost \u00a37 5*s* (equivalent to \u00a3900 today) while the cheapest First Class fares cost \u00a323 (\u00a32,900 today).[104] The most expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to \u00a3870 in high season (\u00a3109,000 today).[117]\n\n\n\n### Collecting passengers[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage began on Wednesday, 10 April 1912. Following the embarkation of the crew, the passengers began arriving at 9:30\u00a0am, when the London and South Western Railway's boat train from London Waterloo station reached Southampton Terminus railway station on the quayside, alongside *Titanic*'s berth.[123] The large number of Third Class passengers meant they were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith.[124] Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States \u2013 a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic.[121] In all, 920 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Southampton \u2013 179 First Class, 247 Second Class, and 494 Third Class. Additional passengers were to be picked up at Cherbourg and Queenstown.[94]\n\n\nThe maiden voyage began at noon, as scheduled. An accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later, as *Titanic* passed the moored liners SS\u00a0*City of New York* of the American Line and *Oceanic* of the White Star Line, the latter of which would have been her running mate on the service from Southampton. Her huge displacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water and then dropped into a trough. *New York*'s mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards *Titanic*. A nearby tugboat, *Vulcan*, came to the rescue by taking *New York* under tow, and Captain Smith ordered *Titanic*'s engines to be put \"full astern\".[125] The two ships avoided a collision by a distance of about 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m). The incident delayed *Titanic*'s departure for about an hour, while the drifting *New York* was brought under control.[126][127]\n\n\nAfter making it safely through the complex tides and channels of Southampton Water and the Solent, *Titanic* disembarked the Southampton pilot at the Nab Lightship and headed out into the English Channel.[128] She headed for the French port of Cherbourg, a journey of 77 nautical miles (89\u00a0mi; 143\u00a0km).[129] The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast.[130] Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of *Titanic*, tenders had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, SS\u00a0*Traffic* and SS\u00a0*Nomadic*. Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the *Olympic*-class liners and were launched shortly after *Titanic*.[131] (*Nomadic* is the only surviving White Star Line ship) Four hours after *Titanic* left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. There, 274 additional passengers were taken aboard \u2013 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class. Twenty-four passengers left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore, having booked only a cross-Channel passage. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8\u00a0pm *Titanic* weighed anchor and left for Queenstown[132] with the weather continuing cold and windy.[130]\n\n\nAt 11:30\u00a0am on Thursday 11 April, *Titanic* arrived at Cork Harbour on the south coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day, with a brisk wind.[130] Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of *Titanic*'s size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Queenstown \u2013 three First Class, seven Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-Channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard *Titanic*, including one of the last known photographs of the ship. The very last one was taken by another cross-channel passenger Kate Odell.[133] A decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore.[134] *Titanic* weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30\u00a0pm and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.[134]\n\n\n\n### Atlantic crossing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Titanic* itinerary on the Northern Atlantic, from Fastnet Light (Ireland) to Ambrose Light (New York)\n![](image)Ice warnings prior to the accident of 14 April\n*Titanic* was planned to arrive at New York Pier 59[135] on the morning of 17 April.[136] After leaving Queenstown, *Titanic* followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock,[137] a distance of some 55 nautical miles (63\u00a0mi; 102\u00a0km). From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles (1,860\u00a0mi; 3,000\u00a0km) along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as \"the corner\" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. *Titanic* sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177\u00a0mi; 1,895\u00a0km) to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.[138] The final leg of the journey would have been 193 nautical miles (222\u00a0mi; 357\u00a0km) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.[139]\n\n\nFrom 11 April to local apparent noon the next day, *Titanic* covered 484 nautical miles (557\u00a0mi; 896\u00a0km); the following day, 519 nautical miles (597\u00a0mi; 961\u00a0km); and by noon on the final day of her voyage, 546 nautical miles (628\u00a0mi; 1,011\u00a0km). From then until the time of her sinking, she travelled another 258 nautical miles (297\u00a0mi; 478\u00a0km), averaging about 21 knots (24\u00a0mph; 39\u00a0km/h).[140]\n\n\nThe weather cleared as she left Ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind. Temperatures remained fairly mild on Saturday 13 April, but the following day *Titanic* crossed a cold weather front with strong winds and waves of up to 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m). These died down as the day progressed until, by the evening of Sunday 14 April, it became clear, calm, and very cold.[141]\n\n\nThe first three days of the voyage from Queenstown had passed without apparent incident. A fire had begun in one of *Titanic*'s coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage,[142] but passengers were unaware of this situation. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships at the time, due to spontaneous combustion of the coal.[143] The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace.[144] The fire was finally extinguished on 14 April.[145][146] There has been some speculation and discussion as to whether this fire and attempts to extinguish it may have made the ship more vulnerable to sinking.[147][148]\n\n\n*Titanic* received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but Captain Smith ignored them.[149] One of the ships to warn *Titanic* was the Atlantic Line's *Mesaba*.[150] Nevertheless, *Titanic* continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time.[151] Although she was not trying to set a speed record,[152] timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed; ice warnings were seen as advisories, and reliance was placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.[151] It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, SS\u00a0*Kronprinz Wilhelm*, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still completed her voyage, and Smith said in 1907 that he \"could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"[153][j]\n\n\n\n### Sinking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sinking of *Titanic*\n\n![Drawing of sinking in four steps from eyewitness description](image)\nThe sinking, based on Jack Thayer's description. Sketched by L.P. Skidmore on board *Carpathia*.\n![Photo of an iceberg taken the day after the sinking at the place of sinking](image)\nThe iceberg thought to have been hit by *Titanic*, photographed on the morning of 15 April 1912. Note the dark spot just along the berg's waterline, which was described by onlookers as a smear of red paint.\n![\"Untergang der Titanic\", a painting showing a big ship sinking with survivors in the water and boats](image)\n\"Untergang *der Titanic*\", as conceived by Willy St\u00f6wer, 1912\n\nAt 11:40\u00a0pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of *Titanic* and alerted the bridge.[156] First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the iceberg and the engines to be reversed,[157] but it was too late. The starboard side of *Titanic* struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.[k] The hull was not punctured, but rather dented such that its seams buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that *Titanic* would sink, as she could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. She began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.[159]\n\n\nThose aboard *Titanic* were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels,[160][l] *Titanic* only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats.[162] The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.[163] Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water.[164] The \"women and children first\" protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats,[164] and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard. Women and children survived at rates of about 75 percent and 50 percent, while only 20 percent of men survived.[165]\n\n\nBetween 2:10 and 2:15\u00a0am, a little over two and a half hours after *Titanic* struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as the boat deck dipped underwater, and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.[166] As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship broke in two main pieces between the second and third funnels, due to the immense forces on the keel. With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,[167] before foundering at 2:20\u00a0am.[168] It was believed that *Titanic* sank in one piece, but the discovery of the wreck many years later revealed that she had broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed in water at a temperature of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F). Only five who were in the water were helped into the lifeboats, though the lifeboats had room for almost 500 more people.[169]\n\n\nDistress signals were sent by wireless, rockets, and lamp, but none of the ships that responded were near enough to reach *Titanic* before she sank.[170] A radio operator on board SS\u00a0*Birma*, for instance, estimated that it would be 6\u00a0am before the liner could arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, SS\u00a0*Californian*, which was the last to have been in contact before the collision, saw *Titanic*'s flares but failed to assist.[171] Around 4\u00a0am, RMS\u00a0*Carpathia* arrived on the scene in response to *Titanic*'s earlier distress calls.[172]\n\n\nWhen the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.[173] 706 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by *Carpathia* to New York, *Titanic*'s original destination, while 1,517 people died.[106] *Carpathia*'s captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20 large bergs measuring up to 200 feet (61\u00a0m) high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from *Titanic*; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.[174] This area is now known as Iceberg Alley.[175]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath of sinking[edit]\n\n\n### Immediate aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The New York Times* had gone to press 15 April with knowledge of the collision but not the sinking.[176]\n![](image)\nThe International Mercantile Marine Company's statement on Monday 15 April assured that despite the lack of communication from the ship, it was \"unsinkable\".[177]\n\n![](image)\nLondon newsboy Ned Parfett with news of the disaster, as reported on Tuesday, 16 April\n![](image)\n*Titanic* had been scheduled for a 20 April departure, seen in a *New York Times* ad apparently unable to be pulled, overnight, before this 15 April printing.[178]\n\nRMS\u00a0*Carpathia* took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. Her journey was slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.[179] She was, however, able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. The initial reports were confusing, leading the American press to report erroneously on 15 April that *Titanic* was being towed to port by SS\u00a0*Virginian*.[180] Late on the night of 15 April White Star reported a message received saying *Titanic* had sunk, but all her passengers and crew had been transferred to another vessel.[181] Later that day, confirmation came through that *Titanic* had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died.[182] The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal,[183] Southampton,[184] Liverpool and Belfast.[185] It hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking;[186] four out of every five crew members came from this town.[187][m]\n*Carpathia* docked at 9:30\u00a0pm on 18 April at New York's Pier 54 and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain.[190] Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organisations.[191] Many of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia. *Titanic*'s 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer SS\u00a0*Lapland*, where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.[192]\n\n\n*Carpathia* was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to Fiume, Austria-Hungary. Her crew were given a bonus of a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of *Titanic*'s passengers joined to give them an additional bonus of nearly \u00a3900 (\u00a3113,000 today), divided among the crew members.[193]\n\n\nThe ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the pilot boat *New York*, which guided *Carpathia* into harbour, and one even managed to get onto *Carpathia* before she docked.[194] Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards.[195] It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard *Titanic*.[n]\n\n\n\n### Insurance, aid for survivors and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCartoon demanding better safety from shipping companies, 1912\n![](image)\nMolly Brown presenting award to *Carpathia* Captain Arthur Rostron for his service in the rescue\n\nIn January 1912, the hulls and equipment of *Titanic* and *Olympic* had been insured through Lloyd's of London and London Marine Insurance. The total coverage was \u00a31,000,000 (\u00a3102,000,000 today) per ship. The policy was to be \"free from all average\" under \u00a3150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now Willis Group), was 15 *s* (75 *p*) per \u00a3100, or \u00a37,500 (\u00a3940,000 today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days.[197]\n\n\nMany charities were set up to help the survivors and their families, many of whom lost their sole wage earner, or, in the case of many Third Class survivors, everything they owned. In New York City, for example, a joint committee of the American Red Cross and Charity Organization Society formed to disburse financial aid to survivors and dependents of those who died.[198] On 29 April, opera stars Enrico Caruso and Mary Garden and members of the Metropolitan Opera raised $12,000 ($300,000 in 2014)[199] in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of \"Autumn\" and \"Nearer My God To Thee\" were part of the programme.[200] In Britain, relief funds were organised for the families of *Titanic*'s lost crew members, raising nearly \u00a3450,000 (\u00a356,000,000 today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the 1960s.[201]\n\n\nIn the United States and Britain, more than 60 survivors combined to sue the White Star Line for damages connected to loss of life and baggage.[202] The claims totalled $16,804,112 (appr. $419\u00a0million in 2018 USD), which was far in excess of what White Star argued it was responsible for as a limited liability company under American law.[203] Because the bulk of the litigants were in the United States, White Star petitioned the United States Supreme Court in 1914, which ruled in its favour that it qualified as an LLC and found that the causes of the ship's sinking were largely unforeseeable, rather than due to negligence.[204] This sharply limited the scope of damages survivors and family members were entitled to, prompting them to reduce their claims to some $2.5\u00a0million. White Star only settled for $664,000 (appr. $16.56\u00a0million in 2018), about 27% of the original total sought by survivors. The settlement was agreed to by 44 of the claimants in December 1915, with $500,000 set aside for the American claimants, $50,000 for the British, and $114,000 to go towards interest and legal expenses.[202][203]\n\n\n\n### Investigations into the disaster[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic* and British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)**Senate Inquiry**: within five days of the sinking, *The New York Times* published several columns relating to Ismay's conduct\u2014concerning which \"there has been so much comment\".[205] Columns included the statement of attorney Karl H. Behr indicating Ismay had helped supervise loading of passengers in lifeboats, and of William E. Carter stating that he and Ismay boarded a lifeboat only after there were no more women.[205]\nEven before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of the failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-orientated.[206]\n\n\nThe US Senate's inquiry into the disaster was initiated on 19 April, a day after *Carpathia* arrived in New York.[207] The chairman, Senator William Alden Smith, wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all surviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil, which prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was completed on 25 May.[208] The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist, insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing \"his moment to stand on the world stage\". Smith, however, already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on US railroads, and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan, *Titanic*'s ultimate owner.[209]\n\n\nThe British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster was headed by Lord Mersey, and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being run by the Board of Trade, who had previously approved the ship, it was seen by some[*like whom?*] as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being found negligent.[210]\n\n\nEach inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of *Titanic*, crew members of Leyland Line's *Californian*, Captain Arthur Rostron of *Carpathia* and other experts.[211] The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time.[212] The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate,[213] Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings,[214] the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed.[213]\n\n\nNeither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor. The American inquiry concluded that since those involved had followed standard practice, the disaster was an act of God.[215] The British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe,[216] noting that British ships alone had carried 3.5\u00a0million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives,[217] and concluded that Smith had done \"only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position\". Lord Mersey did, however, find fault with the \"extremely high speed (twenty-two knots) which was maintained\" following numerous ice warnings,[218] noting that \"what was a mistake in the case of the *Titanic* would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future\".[216]\n\n\nThe recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.[219] An International Ice Patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea; both measures are still in force today.[220]\n\n\nOn 18 June 1912, Guglielmo Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry regarding the telegraphy. Its final report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient operators maintain a constant service.[221]\n\n\nThe way in which the *Titanic* sank brought to light serious design issues with the *Olympic*-class. This resulted in the *Olympic* receiving a major refit and major design changes for the construction of the *Britannic*.[222]\n\n\nIn August 1912, the liner *Corsican* also struck an iceberg in the Atlantic, severely damaging her bow; however due to the weather being hazy at the time, her speed had been reduced to 'dead slow', so limiting further damage. Although the lifeboats had been swung out, they were not boarded.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Role of SS *Californian*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)SS *Californian*, which had tried to warn *Titanic* of the danger from pack-ice\nOne of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by SS\u00a0*Californian*, which had been only a few miles from *Titanic* but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to her signal rockets. *Californian* had stopped for the night because of icy conditions and warned *Titanic* by radio, but was rebuked by *Titanic*'s senior wireless operator, Jack Phillips.[224]\n\n\nTestimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10\u00a0pm, *Californian* observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10\u00a0pm) that this was a passenger liner.[224] At 11:50\u00a0pm, the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible.[224] Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30\u00a0pm and 1:00\u00a0am, but were not acknowledged.[225] If *Titanic* was as far from the *Californian* as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact *Titanic* by that method. Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached *Titanic* in time to save additional lives.[75]\n\n\nCaptain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00\u00a0pm to spend the night;[226] however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10\u00a0am that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white.[*clarification needed*] Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50\u00a0am and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15\u00a0am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.[227]\n\n\n*Californian* eventually responded. At around 5:30\u00a0am, Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator Cyril Furmstone Evans, informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ship. He got news of *Titanic*'s loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after *Carpathia* had already picked up all the survivors.[228]\n\n\nThe inquiries found that the ship seen by *Californian* was in fact *Titanic* and that it would have been possible for *Californian* to come to her rescue; therefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.[229][o]\n\n\n\n### Survivors and victims[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of the *Titanic*\n\nThe number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, because of a number of factors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists.[231] The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.[232] The tables below use figures from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.[106] While the use of the Marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to *Titanic* before it sank, the use of wireless did bring *Carpathia* in time to rescue some of the survivors who otherwise would have perished due to exposure.[50]\n\n\nThe water temperature was well below normal in the area where *Titanic* sank. It also contributed to the rapid death of many passengers during the sinking. Water temperature readings taken around the time of the accident were reported to be \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F). Typical water temperatures were normally around 7\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u00a0\u00b0F) during mid-April.[233] The coldness of the water was a critical factor, often causing death within minutes for many of those in the water.\n\n\nFewer than a third of those aboard *Titanic* survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard *Carpathia*.[234] The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard *Titanic*. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third-class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third-class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first- and second-class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class.[235] In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.\n\n\nThomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster.[236]\n\n\nThe last living survivor, Millvina Dean from England, who, at only nine weeks old, was the youngest passenger on board, died aged 97 on 31 May 2009.[237] Two special survivors were the stewardess Violet Jessop and the stoker Arthur John Priest,[238] who survived the sinkings of both *Titanic* and HMHS\u00a0*Britannic* and were aboard RMS\u00a0*Olympic* when she was rammed in 1911.[239][240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age/sex\n | Class/crew\n | Number aboard\n | Number saved\n | Number lost\n | Percentage saved\n | Percentage lost\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Children\n | First Class\n | 6\n | 5\n | 1\n | 83%\n | 17%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 24\n | 24\n | 0\n | 100%\n | 0%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 79\n | 27\n | 52\n | 34%\n | 66%\n |\n| Women\n | First Class\n | 144\n | 140\n | 4\n | 97%\n | 3%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 93\n | 80\n | 13\n | 86%\n | 14%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 165\n | 76\n | 89\n | 46%\n | 54%\n |\n| Crew\n | 23\n | 20\n | 3\n | 87%\n | 13%\n |\n| Men\n | First Class\n | 175\n | 57\n | 118\n | 33%\n | 67%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 168\n | 14\n | 154\n | 8%\n | 92%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 462\n | 75\n | 387\n | 16%\n | 84%\n |\n| Crew\n | 885\n | 192\n | 693\n | 22%\n | 78%\n |\n| Total\n | 2,224\n | 710\n | 1,514\n | 32%\n | 68%\n |\n\n\n### Retrieval and burial of the dead[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph](image)Markers of *Titanic* victims, Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia\nOnce the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship CS *Mackay-Bennett* from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to retrieve bodies.[242] Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship *Minia*,[243] lighthouse supply ship *Montmagny* and sealing vessel *Algerine*.[244] Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.[245][p]\n\n\nThe first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS\u00a0*Mackay-Bennett*, found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port.[247] Captain Larnder of the *Mackay-Bennett* and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first-class passengers, justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third-class passengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder identified many of those buried at sea as crew members by their clothing, and stated that as a mariner, he himself would be contented to be buried at sea.[248]\n\n\nBodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax Registrar of Vital Statistics, John Henry Barnstead, developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was set up in the curling rink of the Mayflower Curling Club and undertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist.[248] Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150 bodies, were buried in three Halifax cemeteries, the largest being Fairview Lawn Cemetery followed by the nearby Mount Olivet and Baron de Hirsch cemeteries.[249]\n\n\nIn mid-May 1912, RMS\u00a0*Oceanic* recovered three bodies over 200 miles (320\u00a0km) from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A. When Fifth Officer Harold Lowe and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible A, but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants.[q] After their retrieval from Collapsible A by *Oceanic*, the bodies were buried at sea.[250]\n\n\nThe last *Titanic* body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel *Algerine* on 22 May and buried at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax on 12 June.[251]\n\n\nOnly 333 bodies of *Titanic* victims were recovered, which amounted to one in five of the over 1,500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles, making them difficult to recover. By June, one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.[252]\n\n\nBodies of passengers of the Titanic were numbered as they were brought aboard. Physical characteristics, clothing, identifying marks, and personal effects were all documented. Personal effects were stored separately, labeled with the same body number, and valuables were locked up by the purser. Without enough material or space to handle bodies and their belongings, the crew had to triage. [253]\n\n\n\n## Wreck[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wreck of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)The bow of *Titanic*, photographed in June 2004\n*Titanic* was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.[254] The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over 12,000 feet (3,700\u00a0m) below the surface, where the water pressure is over 6,000 pounds per square inch (40 megapascals),[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] about 400 standard atmospheres. A number of expeditions were mounted to find *Titanic* but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard succeeded.[255][256][257]\n\n\nThe team discovered that *Titanic* had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6\u00a0km) apart in Titanic Canyon off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located 13.2 miles (21.2\u00a0km) from the inaccurate coordinates given by *Titanic*'s radio operators on the night of her sinking,[258] and approximately 715 miles (1,151\u00a0km) from Halifax and 1,250 miles (2,012\u00a0km) from New York.\n\n\nBoth sections struck the seabed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.[259]\n\n\nThe two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately 5 by 3 miles (8\u00a0km \u00d7\u00a05\u00a0km).[260] It contains hundreds of thousands of items, such as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which fell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor.[261] The debris field was also the last resting place of a number of *Titanic*'s victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots\u2014which have proved to be inedible\u2014as the only sign that bodies once lay there.[262]\n\n\nSince its initial discovery, the wreck of *Titanic* has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull.[263] In 2006, it was estimated that within 50 years the hull and structure of *Titanic* would eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.[264]\n\n\n\n![](image)The ship's bell, recovered from the wreck\nMany artefacts from *Titanic* have been recovered from the seabed by RMS Titanic Inc., which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and in a permanent exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.[265] A number of other museums exhibit artefacts either donated by survivors or retrieved from the floating bodies of victims of the disaster.[266]\n\n\nOn 16 April 2012, the day after the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos[267] were released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The photos, taken by Robert Ballard during an expedition led by NOAA in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to *Titanic*'s stern which experts called \"compelling evidence\" that it is the spot where somebody came to rest, and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them.[268] The wreck of the *Titanic* falls under the scope of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state co-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the *Titanic*, and co-operate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.[269][270][271]\n\n\nSubmersible dives in 2019 have found further deterioration of the wreck, including loss of the captain's bathtub.[272] Between 29 July and 4 August 2019, a two-person submersible vehicle that was conducting research and filming a documentary crashed into the wreck. EYOS Expeditions executed the dives. It reported that the strong currents pushed the submersible into the wreck, leaving a red rust stain on the submersible's side. The report did not mention if the *Titanic* sustained damage.[273]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Magellan Ltd., a deep-water seabed-mapping company, announced that they had created a \"digital twin\" of the *Titanic*, showing the wreckage in a level of detail that had never been captured before. The company created the model from some 715,000 3D images, captured over the course of a six-week expedition in the summer of 2022, using two submersibles, named *Romeo* and *Juliet*. They mapped \"every millimetre\" of the wreckage as well as the entire three-nautical-mile (5.6\u00a0km) debris field. Creating the model took about eight months.[274][275]\n\n\nOn 18 June 2023, the submersible *Titan*, operated by OceanGate Expeditions, went missing in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. The submersible, designed to carry five people, was carrying an expedition of tourists to view the wreckage of the *Titanic*.[276][277] On 22 June 2023, the operating company announced that they believe the *Titan* crew were lost at sea after a catastrophic implosion of the submersible,[278] and, six days later, the U.S. Coast Guard announced its discovery of \u201cpresumed human remains\u201d consistent with such an implosion found within recovered remnants of the *Titan*.[279]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)An ice patrol aircraft inspecting an iceberg\nAfter the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea passed in 1914.[280] The convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974.[281] Signatories to the Convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example, in Britain, new \"Rules for Life Saving Appliances\" were passed by the Board of Trade on 8 May 1914 and then applied at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.[282]\n\n\nFurther, the United States government passed the Radio Act of 1912. This Act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations.[283] In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed, it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.[283] In the same year, the Board of Trade chartered the barque *Scotia* to act as a weather ship in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, keeping a look-out for icebergs. A Marconi wireless telegraph was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland.[284][285]\n\n\nFinally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, an agency of the U.S. Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period, there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.[286]\n\n\n\n### Cultural[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural legacy of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)*Titanic* Belfast, photographed in November 2017\n*Titanic* has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable.[r] For more than 100 years, she has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking, memorial postcards sold in huge numbers[287] together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,[288] and even black mourning teddy bears.[289] The sinking inspired many ballads such as \"The Titanic\".[290] Several survivors wrote books about their experiences,[291] but it was not until 1955 that the first historically accurate book \u2013 *A Night to Remember* \u2013 was published.[292]\n\n\nThe first film about the disaster, *Saved from the Titanic*, was released only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its star\u2014the silent film actress Dorothy Gibson. This film is considered lost.[293] The British film *A Night to Remember* (1958) is still widely regarded as the most historically accurate movie portrayal of the sinking.[294] The most financially successful by far has been James Cameron's *Titanic* (1997), which became the highest-grossing film in history up to that time,[295] as well as the winner of 11 Oscars at the 70th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron.[296]\n\n\nThe *Titanic* disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton and Liverpool in England; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and Belfast and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland.[297] A number of museums around the world have displays on *Titanic*; the most prominent is in Belfast, the ship's birthplace (see below). \n\n\nRMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a permanent *Titanic* exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Nevada which features a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull. It also runs an exhibition which travels around the world.[298] In Nova Scotia, Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic displays items that were recovered from the sea a few days after the disaster. They include pieces of woodwork such as panelling from the ship's First Class Lounge and an original deckchair,[299] as well as objects removed from the victims.[300] In 2012 the centenary was marked by plays, radio programmes, parades, exhibitions and special trips to the site of the sinking together with commemorative stamps and coins.[186][301][302][303][304] Royal Mail (whose mail was carried by RMS (Royal Mail Ship) *Titanic*) issued ten 1st class UK postage stamps, each with the \"crown seal\", to mark the centenary of the disaster.[305]\n\n\nIn a frequently commented-on literary coincidence, Morgan Robertson authored a novel called *Futility* in 1898 about a fictional British passenger liner with the plot bearing a number of similarities to the *Titanic* disaster. In the novel, the ship is SS *Titan*, a four-stacked liner, the largest in the world and considered unsinkable; like the *Titanic*, she sinks in April after hitting an iceberg and does not have enough lifeboats.[306]\n\n\n\n#### In Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nIt took many decades before the significance of *Titanic* was promoted in Northern Ireland, where it was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. While the rest of the world embraced the glory and tragedy of *Titanic*, it remained a taboo subject throughout the 20th century in its birth city. The sinking brought tremendous grief and was a blow to Belfast's pride. Its shipyard was also a place many Catholics regarded as hostile.[307] In the latter half of the century, during a 30-year sectarian conflict, *Titanic* was a reminder of the lack of civil rights that in part contributed towards the Troubles. While the fate of *Titanic* remained a well-known story within local households throughout the 20th century, commercial investment in projects recalling RMS *Titanic*'s legacy was modest because of these issues.[308]\n\n\nAfter the Troubles and Good Friday Agreement, the number of overseas tourists visiting Northern Ireland increased.[309] It was subsequently identified in the Northern Ireland Tourism Board's *Strategic Framework for Action 2004\u20132007* that the significance of and interest in *Titanic* globally (partly due to the 1997 film *Titanic*) was not being fully exploited as a tourist attraction.[310] Thus, *Titanic* Belfast was spearheaded, along with some smaller projects, such as a *Titanic* memorial.[311]\n\n\nIn 2012 on the ship's centenary, the *Titanic* Belfast visitor attraction was opened on the site of the shipyard where *Titanic* was built.[312] It was Northern Ireland's second most visited tourist attraction with almost 700,000 visitors in 2016.[313]\n\n\nDespite over 1,600 ships being built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast Harbour, Queen's Island became renamed after its most famous ship, Titanic Quarter in 1995. Once a sensitive story, *Titanic* is now considered one of Northern Ireland's most revered and uniting symbols.[314][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 *Titanic* relics that were an asset of the bankrupt Premier Exhibitions.[315] Eventually, *Titanic* Belfast, Titanic Foundation Limited and the National Museums Northern Ireland joined with the National Maritime Museum as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artefacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. Oceanographer Robert Ballard said he favoured this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where *Titanic* was built) and in Greenwich.[315] The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy court in Jacksonville, Florida. The minimum bid for the 11 October 2018 auction was set at US$21.5\u00a0million (\u00a316.5m) and the consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount.[316][317] On 17 October 2018, *The New York Times* reported that a consortium of three hedge funds\u2014Apollo Global Management, Alta Fundamental Advisers, and PacBridge Capital Partners\u2014had paid US$19.5\u00a0million for the collection.[318] At the time of the purchase, the consortium agreed to continued oversight by the court concerning new exploration or salvage expedition must receive approval from NOAA and the court. Further, the purchase price gives Premier's unsecured creditors an 80% recovery.\n\n\n\n## Appendix[edit]\n\n\nDiagrams of RMS *Titanic*\nDiagram of RMS *Titanic* showing the arrangement of the bulkheads in red.

A project by South African businessman Sarel Gaus was abandoned in 2006, and a project by Australian businessman Clive Palmer was announced in 2012, known as the *Titanic II*.\n\n\nA Chinese shipbuilding company known as Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co., Ltd commenced construction in November 2016 to build a replica ship of the *Titanic* for use in a resort. The vessel was to house many features of the original, such as a ballroom, dining hall, theatre, first-class cabins, economy cabins and swimming pool.[326][327] Tourists were to be able to reside inside the *Titanic* during their time at the resort. It was to be permanently docked at the resort and feature an audiovisual simulation of the sinking, which has caused some criticism.[328] As of 2022, however, it was reportedly only 25% complete,[329] and its website and Twitter account are offline.\n\n\nRMS *Olympic* was the sister ship of the *Titanic*. The interior decoration of the dining salon and the grand staircase were in identical style and created by the same craftsmen. Large parts of the interior of the *Olympic* were later sold and are now in the White Swan Hotel, Alnwick, which gives an impression of how the interior of the *Titanic* looked.\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Transport portal\n* ![icon](image)Oceans portal\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* *Titanic* conspiracy theories\n* *Titanic* in popular culture\n* Seamen's Act\n* Lists of shipwrecks\n* *The Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility*\n\n\n### Comparable disasters[edit]\n\n\n* SS\u00a0*Atlantic*, White Star Line ship lost in 1873 with the greatest loss of life for the company before *Titanic*\n* SS\u00a0*Eastland*, a ship capsizing in 1915 after being fitted with extra lifeboats\n* MS\u00a0*Estonia*\n* RMS\u00a0*Empress of Ireland*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The death toll of the sinking of *Tek Sing* in 1822 is not known exactly, but it may have exceeded that of *Titanic*.\n2. **^** Carlisle would leave the project in 1910, before the ships were launched, when he became a shareholder in Welin Davit & Engineering Company Ltd, the firm making the ship's davits.[12] Wilding was sacked following the *Titanic* disaster, having been unfairly blamed by Pirrie for the ship's loss.[13]\n3. **^** It was kept off-limits to passengers; the famous \"flying\" scene at the ship's bow from the 1997 film *Titanic* would not have been permitted in real life.\n4. **^** Copy of the neoclassical oil painting by Merry-Joseph Blondel[63]\n5. **^** Measurement of lifeboats: **1\u20132:** 25'2\" long by 7'2\" wide by 3'2\" deep; 326.6 cubic feet (9.25\u00a0m3); **3\u201316:** 30' long by 9'1\" wide by 4' deep; 655.2 cubic feet (18.55\u00a0m3) and **A\u2013D:** 27'5\" long by 8' wide by 3' deep; 376.6 cubic feet (10.66\u00a0m3)\n6. **^** Since 1894, when the largest passenger ship under consideration was the Cunard Line's 13,000-ton *Lucania*, the Board of Trade had made no provision to increase the existing scale regarding the number of required lifeboats for larger ships, such as the 46,000-ton *Titanic*. Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale \"from time to time\", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried \"uselessly\" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16 boats in any emergency, he \"did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]\".[74]\n7. **^** He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.[110]\n8. **^** *Titanic* also had a ship's cat, Jenny, who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.[114]\n9. **^** Known afterward as the \"Unsinkable Molly Brown\" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank.\n10. **^** Captain Edward Smith had been in command of *Titanic*'s sister *Olympic* when she in 1911 collided with a warship. Even though that ship was designed to sink others by ramming them, it suffered greater damage than *Olympic*, thereby strengthening the image of the class being unsinkable.[154][155]\n11. **^** The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern ultrasound surveys of the wreck suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than 12 to 13 square feet (1.1 to 1.2\u00a0m2).[158][82]\n12. **^** An incident confirmed this philosophy while *Titanic* was under construction: the White Star liner *Republic* was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.[161]\n13. **^** The Salvation Army newspaper, *The War Cry*, reported that \"none but a heart of stone would be unmoved in the presence of such anguish. Night and day that crowd of pale, anxious faces had been waiting patiently for the news that did not come. Nearly every one in the crowd had lost a relative.\"[188] It was not until 17 April that the first incomplete lists of survivors came through, delayed by poor communications.[189]\n14. **^** On 23 April, the *Daily Mail* reported: \"Late in the afternoon hope died out. The waiting crowds thinned, and silent men and women sought their homes. In the humbler homes of Southampton there is scarcely a family who has not lost a relative or friend. Children returning from school appreciated something of tragedy, and woeful little faces were turned to the darkened, fatherless homes.\"[196]\n15. **^**  Lord protested his innocence to the end of his life, and many researchers have asserted that the known positions of *Titanic* and *Californian* make it impossible that the former was the infamous \"mystery ship\", a topic which has \"generated ... millions of words and ... hours of heated debates\" and continues to do so.[230]\n16. **^** Most of the bodies were numbered; however, the five passengers buried at sea by *Carpathia* went unnumbered.[246]\n17. **^** Thomson Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.\n18. **^** An example is Daniel Butler's book about RMS *Titanic*, titled *Unsinkable*.\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Ship's time; at the time of the collision, *Titanic*'s clocks were set to 2 hours 2 minutes ahead of Eastern Time Zone and 2 hours 58 minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time.[324]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Titanic History, Facts and Stories\". *Titanic Museum Belfast*.

The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] *Star Wars* is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\n\nThe original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope*, was followed by the sequels *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi* (1983), forming the original *Star Wars* trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode I: The Phantom Menace* (1999), *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* (2002), and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode VII: The Force Awakens* (2015), *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* (2017), and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019).\n\n\nAll nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films *Rogue One* (2016) and *Solo* (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10\u00a0billion, making *Star Wars* the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\"[3] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle.[4] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[5][6][7] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a *Star Wars* planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[8] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[9][10] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.[11][12][13] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections and hyperspace transmission.[14]\n\n\nThe universe of *Star Wars* is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[15] One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as \"an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together\".[16] The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[17] Through training and meditation, those whom \"the Force is strong with\" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[18] It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.[19] The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.[20][21] While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[22]\n\n\nThe franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and empires, such as the evil Galactic Empire.[23] The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts.[24] The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms.[25] In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant.[26] Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments, while illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.[26]\n\n\nThe combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes *Star Wars* a very universal franchise, capable of telling stories of various genres.[27]\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars films\n\n### The Skywalker Saga[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Original trilogy: Episodes IV\u2013VI\n |\n| *Star Wars* | May\u00a025,\u00a01977\u00a0(1977-05-25) | George Lucas | Gary Kurtz | [28][29] |\n| *The Empire Strikes Back* | May\u00a021,\u00a01980\u00a0(1980-05-21) | Irvin Kershner | Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan | George Lucas\n | [30][31] |\n| *Return of the Jedi* | May\u00a025,\u00a01983\u00a0(1983-05-25) | Richard Marquand | Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas\n | Howard Kazanjian | [32][33] |\n| Prequel trilogy: Episodes I\u2013III\n |\n| *The Phantom Menace* | May\u00a019,\u00a01999\u00a0(1999-05-19) | George Lucas | George Lucas\n | George Lucas\n | Rick McCallum | [34] |\n| *Attack of the Clones* | May\u00a016,\u00a02002\u00a0(2002-05-16) | George Lucas and Jonathan Hales | [35][36] |\n| *Revenge of the Sith* | May\u00a019,\u00a02005\u00a0(2005-05-19) | George Lucas\n | [37][38] |\n| Sequel trilogy: Episodes VII\u2013IX\n |\n| *The Force Awakens* | December\u00a018,\u00a02015\u00a0(2015-12-18) | J.

This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019.[45]\n\n\nEach trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith lord Palpatine (Darth Sidious).[46] The original trilogy depicts the heroic development of Luke Skywalker as a Jedi and his fight against Palpatine's Galactic Empire alongside his sister, Leia.[47] The prequels tell the tragic backstory of their father, Anakin, who is corrupted by Palpatine and becomes Darth Vader.[48] The sequels feature Leia's son, Ben Solo, and Luke and Leia's proteg\u00e9, Rey, thirty years after the fall of the Empire.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Original trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars original trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe original trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and James Earl Jones (Darth Vader's voice).\n\nIn 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the *Flash Gordon* serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera.[50][c] After directing *American Graffiti* (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in.[51][52] By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.[53] Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost.[54]\n\n\n*Star Wars* was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope* in the 1979 book *The Art of Star Wars*.[55] The film's success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.[56] With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies.[57] *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi*, was released on May 25, 1983.\n\n\n\n#### Prequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars prequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe prequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Natalie Portman (Padm\u00e9 Amidala), Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker),[d] and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine).\n\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.[58] In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,[59] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.[60] In 1983, Lucas explained that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.\"[61]\n\n\nTechnical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be \"unbelievably expensive\".[62] In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.[63] A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 \"updated\" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.[64]\n\n\n*Episode I: The Phantom Menace* was released on May 19, 1999, *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* on May 16, 2002, and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* on May 19, 2005.[65] The first two films were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as \"the tragedy of Darth Vader\".[66]\n\n\n\n#### Sequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars sequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe sequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron).\n\nPrior to releasing the original 1977 film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films\".[57][67] However, he announced to *Time* in 1978 that he planned \"10 sequels\".[68] He confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981.[69] At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic,[70] the return of Luke as a Jedi Master (a role similar to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy),[67] Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia),[58] Han, Leia,[71] R2-D2 and C-3PO.[57][72] However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that *Star Wars* was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.[73][74]\n\n\nLucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more *Star Wars* films.[75] That October, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that *Episode VII* would be released in 2015.[76] The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president and served as executive producer of new *Star Wars* feature films.[77] Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,[78] but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.[79][80] The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the *Star Wars* Expanded Universe stories, which were discarded from canon to give \"maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience.\"[2]\n\n\n*Episode VII: The Force Awakens* was released on December 16, 2015, *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* on December 13, 2017, and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* on December 18, 2019, in many countries.[e] *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi* were both critical and box office successes.[81][82] *Episode IX* received a mixed reception from critics and audiences.[83]\n\n\n\n### Standalone films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story* | December\u00a016,\u00a02016\u00a0(2016-12-16) | Gareth Edwards | Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy | John Knoll and Gary Whitta | Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Shearmur and Simon Emanuel\n | [84] |\n| *Solo: A Star Wars Story* | May\u00a025,\u00a02018\u00a0(2018-05-25) | Ron Howard | Jonathan Kasdan & Lawrence Kasdan\n | [85] |\n\n\nSeveral *Star Wars* films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga. In 2008, Lucasfilm released the animated film *The Clone Wars*, which is set during the prequel trilogy and serves as the theatrical pilot of the television series of the same name.[86] Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, an \"anthology\" film series set between the main episodes of the Skywalker Saga entered development in parallel with the production of the sequel trilogy,[87] described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe anthology films' main casts include (from left to right) Felicity Jones (Jyn Erso) and Diego Luna (Cassian Andor) from *Rogue One* and Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo) and Woody Harrelson (Tobias Beckett) from *Solo*.\n\nThe first film released was *Rogue One* in 2016, which tells the story of the rebels who steal the plans for the Death Star, the Galactic Empire's superweapon, just before the events of the original *Star Wars* film.[89][90] A second film, *Solo*, was released in 2018 and tells the backstory of original trilogy character Han Solo several years prior to the original *Star Wars* film.[91] The television series *Obi-Wan Kenobi* was originally planned as a film, but changed to a limited series due to *Solo* underperforming at the box office.[92]\n\n\n\n### Upcoming films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Status\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Untitled *New Jedi Order* film\n | TBA\n | Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy | Steven Knight | Kathleen Kennedy\n | In development\n | [93] |\n| Untitled *Dawn of the Jedi* film\n | James Mangold | [93] |\n| Untitled *New Republic* film\n | Dave Filoni | [93] |\n\n\nIn April 2023, three new *Star Wars* films were announced to be set within different eras of the franchise.[94] An untitled film written and directed by James Mangold will be set during the \"dawn of the Jedi\".[94] Dave Filoni will direct a film set between the original and sequel trilogies during the New Republic era, serving as the climax of the various live-action television series that began with *The Mandalorian* in 2019.[94] Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will direct a third film about a new Jedi Order, set fifteen years after the sequel trilogy.[93][95]\n\n\n\n#### Other potential projects[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm has a number of *Star Wars* films in various stages of development, including: \n\n\n\n* **Untitled Rian Johnson trilogy**: In November 2017, a trilogy of movies written by *The Last Jedi* writer/director Rian Johnson was announced to be in development.[96][97] In April 2023, Kennedy stated that trilogy of films is still in open development at the studio, with the writer/director working on the story, although it is not currently a priority.[98]\n* **Untitled David Benioff & D.B. Weiss trilogy**: In February 2018, it was announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would serve as writers and producers on a trilogy of new *Star Wars* movies.[99] The plot would take place chronologically before the Prequel Trilogy, and center around the origin of the Jedi.[100] By May 2019, the duo were also slated to serve as co-directors of the first installment in their three films.[101] In October of the same year however, the filmmaking duo exited development of the projects due to scheduling conflicts with projects they are developing for Netflix. Kennedy stated that the studio is open to working with the duo, and developing their films once their schedule allows it.[102]\n* **Untitled Taika Waititi film**: In May 2020, Taika Waititi signed onto the project which was stated to be the first priority for the studio, with the filmmaker Waititi serving as director from a script he is co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.[103] In May 2022, the movie was named as the next *Star Wars* film to begin production ahead of *Rogue Squadron*, with Kennedy stating that the studio was tentatively looking towards late 2023 for a debut, but had not yet officially set a release date.[104][105] By April 2023, she stated that the project is still in development, with Waititi continuing to work on the script.[106][98]\n* ***Rogue Squadron***: An anthology film, following the events of *Rogue One*, will be directed by Patty Jenkins with a script written by Matthew Robinson.[107] In April 2023, Kennedy stated that the script is still in development, with the studio considering changing the project into a television series.[108]\n* **Untitled J.D. Dillard film**: In February 2020, a film was announced to be in development from director J. D. Dillard and writer Matt Owens;[109] although, Dillard announced he was no longer to direct that film in November 2022.[110]\n* ***Star Wars: A Droid Story***: In December 2020, an animated film centered around the adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO was announced as being in development; the story will introduce a new heroic character to the franchise, alongside these characters. The project will be a joint-venture production between Lucasfilm Animation, and Industrial Light & Magic. The film is being developed to debut via streaming, exclusively through Disney+.[111][112][113]\n* **Untitled Shawn Levy film**: In November 2022, Shawn Levy entered talks to direct a *Star Wars* film, following his work on *Deadpool 3* (2024) and the fifth and final season of *Stranger Things*.[114]\n* **Untitled Lando film**: A film focused on original trilogy character Lando Calrissian, reported to be written by Donald Glover (who portrayed the character in *Solo*) and Stephen Glover.[115]\n\n\n## Television[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars television series\n\n### Live-action series[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise includes several live-action series. The first series, *The Mandalorian*, was released in 2019 for the streaming service Disney+ and is set between the original and sequel trilogies of the Skywalker Saga.[116] Due to its success, the series spawned multiple live-action spin-offs set during the same fictional era, including *The Book of Boba Fett*, released in 2021; *Ahsoka*, released in 2023; and the upcoming *Skeleton Crew*.[117][118][119] These series follow the plight of the New Republic and its allies against the remnants of the fallen Galactic Empire.[120]\n\n\nA story focused on Obi-Wan Kenobi, a character from the original *Star Wars* trilogy, was planned as a film before becoming a live-action series after the box office failure of *Solo* in 2018.[92] The series was released on Disney+ in 2022 and is set between the prequel and original trilogy films.[121] It was followed by the live-action series *Andor* in the same year; both series follow their titular characters during the reign of the Empire.[121][122]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Live-action series** |\n| *The Mandalorian* | 3 | 24 | November\u00a012,\u00a02019\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2019-11-12\u00a0\u2013 present) | Disney+ |\n| *The Book of Boba Fett* | 1 | 7 | December\u00a029,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 February\u00a09,\u00a02022\u00a0(2021-12-29\u00a0\u2013 2022-02-09) |\n| *Obi-Wan Kenobi* | 1 | 6 | May\u00a027\u00a0\u2013 June\u00a022,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-05-27\u00a0\u2013 2022-06-22) |\n| *Andor* | 1 | 12 | September\u00a021,\u00a02022\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2022-09-21\u00a0\u2013 present) |\n| *Ahsoka* | 1 | 8 | August\u00a022\u00a0\u2013 October\u00a03,\u00a02023\u00a0(2023-08-22\u00a0\u2013 2023-10-03) |\n| **Game shows** |\n| *Jedi Temple Challenge* | 1 | 10 | June\u00a010\u00a0\u2013 August\u00a05,\u00a02020\u00a0(2020-06-10\u00a0\u2013 2020-08-05) | StarWarsKids.com |\n\n### Animated series[edit]\n\n\nThe first two animated series, *Droids* and *Ewoks*, were produced in the 1980s.[123] They were followed by the *Clone Wars* animated micro-series in 2003 and the 2008 series of the same name. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, all animated series released prior to 2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise's canon.[2] Subsequent animated series include *Rebels*, released in 2014; *Resistance*, released in 2018; and *The Bad Batch*, released in 2021. \n\n\nSeveral micro-series and shorts have also been released by Lucasfilm since Disney's acquisition, with the earlier animated series falling under Disney's \"Vintage\" collection of *Star Wars* content.[124][125]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Animated series** |\n| *Droids* | 1 | 13 | September\u00a07,\u00a01985\u00a0\u2013 June\u00a07,\u00a01986\u00a0(1985-09-07\u00a0\u2013 1986-06-07) | ABC |\n| *Ewoks* | 2 | 26 | September\u00a07,\u00a01985\u00a0\u2013 December\u00a013,\u00a01986\u00a0(1985-09-07\u00a0\u2013 1986-12-13) |\n| *The Clone Wars* | 7 | 133 | October\u00a03,\u00a02008\u00a0\u2013 May\u00a04,\u00a02020\u00a0(2008-10-03\u00a0\u2013 2020-05-04) | Cartoon Network / Netflix / Disney+ |\n| *Rebels* | 4 | 75 | October\u00a03,\u00a02014\u00a0\u2013 March\u00a05,\u00a02018\u00a0(2014-10-03\u00a0\u2013 2018-03-05) | Disney XD |\n| *Resistance* | 2 | 40 | October\u00a07,\u00a02018\u00a0\u2013 January\u00a026,\u00a02020\u00a0(2018-10-07\u00a0\u2013 2020-01-26) | Disney Channel |\n| *The Bad Batch* | 2 | 47 | May\u00a04,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2021-05-04\u00a0\u2013 present) | Disney+ |\n| *Visions* | 2 | 18 | September\u00a022,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2021-09-22\u00a0\u2013 present) |\n| *Tales of the Jedi* | 1 | TBA | October\u00a026,\u00a02022\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2022-10-26\u00a0\u2013 present) |\n| *Young Jedi Adventures* | 1 | 25 | May\u00a04,\u00a02023\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2023-05-04\u00a0\u2013 present) | Disney+ / Disney Junior |\n| **Animated micro-series and shorts** |\n| *Clone Wars* | 3 | 25 | November\u00a07,\u00a02003\u00a0\u2013 March\u00a025,\u00a02005\u00a0(2003-11-07\u00a0\u2013 2005-03-25) | Cartoon Network |\n| *Blips* | 1 | 8 | May\u00a03\u00a0\u2013 September\u00a04,\u00a02017\u00a0(2017-05-03\u00a0\u2013 2017-09-04) | YouTube |\n| *Forces of Destiny* | 2 | 32 | July\u00a03,\u00a02017\u00a0\u2013 May\u00a025,\u00a02018\u00a0(2017-07-03\u00a0\u2013 2018-05-25) |\n| *Galaxy of Adventures* | 2 | 55 | November\u00a030,\u00a02018\u00a0\u2013 October\u00a02,\u00a02020\u00a0(2018-11-30\u00a0\u2013 2020-10-02) |\n| *Roll Out* | 1 | 16 | August\u00a09,\u00a02019\u00a0\u2013 April\u00a01,\u00a02020\u00a0(2019-08-09\u00a0\u2013 2020-04-01) |\n| *Galaxy of Creatures* | 2 | 24 | October\u00a014,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 February\u00a021,\u00a02023\u00a0(2021-10-14\u00a0\u2013 2023-02-21) | StarWarsKids.com |\n| *Galactic Pals* | 1 | 12 | April\u00a012\u00a0\u2013 November\u00a01,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-04-12\u00a0\u2013 2022-11-01) |\n| \"Zen \u2013 Grogu and Dust Bunnies\" | Short | 1 | November\u00a012,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-12) | Disney+ |\n\n### Films and specials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Teleplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Network\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Star Wars Holiday Special* | November\u00a017,\u00a01978\u00a0(1978-11-17) | Steve Binder | Pat Proft, Leonard Ripps, Bruce Vilanch, Rod Warren, and Mitzie Welch\n | Joe Layton, Jeff Starsh, Ken Welch, and Mitzie Welch\n | CBS |\n| *The Ewok Adventure* | November\u00a025,\u00a01984\u00a0(1984-11-25) | John Korty | Bob Carrau\n | George Lucas | Thomas G.

A schism within the Jedi leads to the creation of the Sith.[126]\n* The High Republic: Under the protection of the Jedi, the Republic grows into a golden age. This era includes *The High Republic* literary works and the animated series *Young Jedi Adventures*.[126]\n* Fall of the Jedi: The Republic's Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine (secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious), orchestrates the Clone Wars, overthrows the Republic, exterminates the Jedi Order and corrupts Anakin Skywalker.[126][130] This era includes the prequel trilogy films, the beginning of the episodic Skywalker saga, and the animated series *Tales of the Jedi* and *The Clone Wars*.[126]\n* Reign of the Empire: Palpatine's Galactic Empire rules the galaxy and the remaining Jedi are hunted down.[126] This era includes *Solo: A Star Wars Story*, *Obi-Wan Kenobi*, *Andor*, *Rogue One*, the animated series *The Bad Batch* and *Rebels*, and the video games *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor* and *Vader Immortal*.[126]\n* Age of Rebellion: The Rebellion against the Empire spreads across the galaxy, while the Jedi return with the emergence of Luke Skywalker.[126][131] This era includes the original trilogy films[f] and the video games *Star Wars Battlefront II* and *Star Wars: Squadrons*.[126]\n* The New Republic: Following the Empire's defeat, the emergent New Republic attempts to reunite the galaxy, while threatened by the remnants of the Empire.[126] This era includes *The Mandalorian*, *The Book of Boba Fett*, and *Ahsoka*.[126]\n* Rise of the First Order: The remnants of the Empire transform into the First Order but are fought by the Resistance, climaxing with the defeat of Palpatine and the Sith by the Jedi Rey.[126][130] This era includes the sequel trilogy films, the animated series *Star Wars Resistance* and the video game *Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge*.[126]\n* New Jedi Order: Rey builds a new Jedi Order, which will be depicted in an upcoming untitled film.[94][126]\n\n\nThe Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as *Legends* on April 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, *The Clone Wars* film, and television series.[2]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars in other media\n\nFrom 1976 to 2014, the term *Expanded Universe* (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed *Star Wars* storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.[133] Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production. Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the *Star Wars Legends* label,[133] with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game *The Old Republic* the only *Legends* material to still be produced. The *Star Wars* canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film *The Clone Wars* (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.[2] Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement.\n\n\n\n### Print media[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars* in print predates the release of the first film, with the November 1976 novelization of *Star Wars*, initially subtitled \"*From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker*\". Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.[134] The first \"Expanded Universe\" story appeared in Marvel Comics' *Star Wars* #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* the following month.\n\n\n\n#### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Star Wars books\n\n![](image)Timothy Zahn authored the *Thrawn* trilogy, which was widely credited with revitalizing the dormant *Star Wars* franchise in the early 1990s.\nAfter penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* (1978). The novelizations of *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) by Donald F. Glut and *Return of the Jedi* (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as *The Han Solo Adventures* trilogy (1979\u20131980) by Brian Daley,[135] and *The Adventures of Lando Calrissian* trilogy (1983) by L. Neil Smith.[136][137]\n\n\nTimothy Zahn's bestselling *Thrawn* trilogy (1991\u20131993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon.[138][139][140][141] The first novel, *Heir to the Empire*, reached #1 on the *New York Times* Best Seller list,[142] and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius Thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire.[143] In *The Courtship of Princess Leia* (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the *Thrawn* trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately marry.[144][145] Steve Perry's *Shadows of the Empire* (1996), set between *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi*, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.[146][147] The novel introduced the crime lord Prince Xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other works.[146][148] Other notable series from Bantam include the *Jedi Academy* trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson,[149][150] the 14-book *Young Jedi Knights* series (1995\u20131998) by Anderson and Rebecca Moesta,[150][151] and the *X-wing* series (1996\u20132012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.[152][153][154]\n\n\nDel Rey took over *Star Wars* book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called *The New Jedi Order* (1999\u20132003). Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.[155][156] The bestselling multi-author series *Legacy of the Force* (2006\u20132008) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia's son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith. Although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in *The Force Awakens* with Han and Leia's son Ben Solo, who becomes the evil Kylo Ren.[157][158][159][160]\n\n\nThree series set in the prequel era were published by Scholastic for younger audiences: the 18-book *Jedi Apprentice* (1999\u20132002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before *The Phantom Menace*; the 11-book *Jedi Quest* (2001\u20132004) follows Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker in between *The Phantom Menace* and *Attack of the Clones*; and the 10-book *The Last of the Jedi* (2005\u20132008), set almost immediately after *Revenge of the Sith*, features Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi. In 2019, a new prequel era novel, starring Qui-Gon and the young Obi-Wan, was published by Del Rey under the title *Star Wars: Master and Apprentice*.[161]\n\n\nAlthough Thrawn had been designated a *Legends* character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the canon in 2016 for the third season of the *Rebels* animated series, with Zahn returning to write more novels based on the character and set in the new canon.[162][163]\n\n\n\n#### Comics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Star Wars comics and List of Star Wars comic books\n\nMarvel Comics published a *Star Wars* comic book series from 1977 to 1986.[164][165][166][167] Original *Star Wars* comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine *Pizzazz* between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first original *Star Wars* stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the *Star Wars* comic series.[168] From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series *Ewoks* and *Droids* inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.[169][170][171] According to Marvel comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of *Star Wars* comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.[172] Marvel's *Star Wars* series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.[173] The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.[174]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new *Star Wars* comic it had in development, which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and published as the popular *Dark Empire* series (1991\u20131995).[175] Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including *Tales of the Jedi* (1993\u20131998), *X-wing Rogue Squadron* (1995\u20131998), *Star Wars: Republic* (1998\u20132006), *Star Wars Tales* (1999\u20132005), *Star Wars: Empire* (2002\u20132006), and *Knights of the Old Republic* (2006\u20132010).[176][177]\n\n\nAfter Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the *Star Wars* comics license would return to Marvel Comics,[178] whose parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009.[179] Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled *Star Wars*, *Darth Vader*, and the limited series *Princess Leia*.[180][181][182]\n\n\nFirst announced as *Project Luminous* at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, the *Star Wars: The High Republic* publishing initiative were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the then current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga was explored in various books and comics. Including ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older respectively.[183]\n\n\n\n### Audio[edit]\n\n\n#### Soundtracks and singles[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music of Star Wars\n\nJohn Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films; he has stated that he will retire from the franchise with *The Rise of Skywalker*.[184] He also composed Han Solo's theme for *Solo: A Star Wars Story*; John Powell adapted and composed the rest of the score.[185] Michael Giacchino composed the score of *Rogue One*.[185] Ludwig G\u00f6ransson scored and composed the music of *The Mandalorian*.[186] Williams also created the main theme for *Galaxy's Edge*.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Audio novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Story of Star Wars and List of Star Wars books\n\nThe first *Star Wars* audio work is *The Story of Star Wars*, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.[188]\n\n\n\n#### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars (radio)\n\nRadio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the *Star Wars* radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1. The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects.[189][190]\n\n\nThe first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes.[191][189][190] Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their film roles.[191][189]\n\n\nThe overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of *The Empire Strikes Back* debuted in 1983.[192] Billy Dee Williams joined the other two stars, reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute *Star Wars* audio drama titled *Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell*, written by Daley.[190][193] In the 1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several *Star Wars* series from Dark Horse Comics into audio dramas: the three-part *Dark Empire* saga, *Tales of the Jedi*, *Dark Lords of the Sith*, the *Dark Forces* trilogy, and *Crimson Empire* (1998).[193] *Return of the Jedi* was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring Daniels.[189][193]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars video games and List of Star Wars video games\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise has spawned over one hundred[194] computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as *Star Wars Legends* and removed from the canon in 2014). *Star Wars* games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n#### Early licensed games (1979\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nThe first officially licensed electronic *Star Wars* game was Kenner's 1979 table-top *Star Wars Electronic Battle Command*.[195][196] In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first *Star Wars* video game for the Atari 2600, *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back*,[197] followed soon the year later by *Star Wars: Jedi Arena*, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game *Star Wars*, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.[198] The next game, *Star Wars: Return of the Jedi* (1984), has more traditional raster graphics,[199] while the following *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1985) has vector graphics.[200]\n\n\nPlatform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive *Star Wars* (1987), an international *Star Wars* (1991), and *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1992). *Super Star Wars* (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years.\n\n\n\n#### LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LucasArts\n\nLucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes. In 1993, LucasArts released *Star Wars: X-Wing*, the first self-published *Star Wars* video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise.[201] It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games.[201] The *Rogue Squadron* series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.\n\n\n*Dark Forces* (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy,[202] was the first *Star Wars* first-person shooter.[203] It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, the Jedi.[203][202][204][205] The game was well received,[206][207][208] and it was followed by four sequels.[209][210] The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.[211] Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi,[203][212][213] a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films.[157] A massively multiplayer online role-playing game, *Star Wars Galaxies*, was in operation from 2003 until 2011. After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.[214]\n\n\n\n#### *EA Star Wars* (2014\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the *Star Wars* filmmakers. Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game *Jedi Challenges*, released in November 2017.[215][216] In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play *Star Wars* mobile games.[217] The *Battlefront* games received a canonical reboot with *Star Wars: Battlefront* in November 2015, which was followed by a sequel, *Battlefront II*, in November 2017. A single-player action-adventure game, *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, with an original story and cast of characters, was released in November 2019. A space combat game titled *Star Wars: Squadrons*, which builds upon the space battles from *Battlefront*, was released in October 2020.\n\n\n\n### Theme park attractions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars theme parks attractions\n\nIn addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the traveling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time *A Galactic Spectacular*. An immersive themed area called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019.[218] A themed hotel, *Star Wars*: Galactic Starcruiser, operated from 2022 to 2023 at Walt Disney World.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6\u00a0billion in merchandising revenue.[223] By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20\u00a0billion in merchandising revenue.[224]\n\n\nKenner made the first *Star Wars* action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.[225] *Star Wars* was the first intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history.[226] Lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their *Star Wars* sets.[227] The Lego *Star Wars* video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.[228][229]\n\n\nIn 1977, the board game *Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star* was released.[230][g] A *Star Wars Monopoly* and themed versions of *Trivial Pursuit* and Battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years. The board game *Risk* has been adapted in two editions by Hasbro: *The Clone Wars Edition* (2005)[232] and the *Original Trilogy Edition* (2006).[233] Three *Star Wars* tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.\n\n\n*Star Wars* Trading Cards have been published since the first \"blue\" series, by Topps, in 1977.[234] Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Each card series are of film stills or original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare \"promos\", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II \"floating Yoda\" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most \"base\" or \"common card\" sets are plentiful, many \"insert\" or \"chase cards\" are very rare.[235] From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and produced the *Star Wars Customizable Card Game*.\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\n*Star Wars* features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as \"the shadow\".[236]\nThere are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil.[237] Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the \"Chosen One\", a messianic individual. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until *Return of the Jedi*. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is \"doing what he thinks is right\".[238] George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.[239]\n\n\nThe saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[237] Each character\u2014primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey\u2014follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.[240] A defining step of the journey is \"Atonement with the Father\".[241] Obi-Wan's loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin,[242] whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.[243] Luke's discovery that Vader is his father has strong repercussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema.[244] Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father, Han Solo.[238] Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side.[245] According to *Inverse*, the final scene in *The Last Jedi*, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force, symbolizes that \"the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings.\"[246]\n\n\n\n### Historical influences[edit]\n\n\nPolitical science has been an important element of *Star Wars* since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War.[247][248] Darth Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet.[249][250] Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the *Schutzstaffel* served Adolf Hitler; this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader.[251] Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German \"shock\" troopers. Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II,[252] and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps. World War\u00a0II terms were used for names in the films; *e.g.* the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).[253] Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in *The Empire Strikes Back* resemble tank interiors,[254] and space battles in the original film were based on World War\u00a0I and World War\u00a0II dogfights.[255]\n\n\nPalpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitler's role before appointing himself *F\u00fchrer*.[252] Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and politicians like Richard Nixon.[256][257][h] The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives.[259] The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.[260][261]\n\n\nOn the inspiration for the First Order formed \"from the ashes of the Empire\", *The Force Awakens* director J.\u00a0J. Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and \"started working together again.\"[262]\n\n\n\n* ![The aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.](image)\n\nThe aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.\n* ![The flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.](image)\n\nThe flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe lightsaber and the blaster are iconic elements of the franchise.\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[263] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.[264] Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon.[265] The first *Star Wars* film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[266] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[267] The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.[268] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including *Hardware Wars*, *Spaceballs*, *The Family Guy Trilogy* and *Robot Chicken: Star Wars*.\n\n\nIn 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original *Star Wars* film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[269] *The Empire Strikes Back* was selected in 2010,[270][271] and *Return of the Jedi* was selected in 2021.[272] 35\u00a0mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,[273][274] but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.[275]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37\u00a0million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79\u00a0million.[255] The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.[276] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, *Star Wars* is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[277][278]\n\n\n*Star Wars* fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before *Star Wars*, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.[279] The commercial success of *Star Wars* created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[276] Along with *Jaws*, *Star Wars* started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[280][267] It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.[266]\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book *The Great Movies*, \"Like *The Birth of a Nation* and *Citizen Kane*, *Star Wars* was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.\" It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.[281] Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's *Jaws*, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.[255][282][283]\n\n\nSome critics have blamed *Star Wars* and *Jaws* for \"ruining\" Hollywood by shifting its focus from \"sophisticated\" films such as *The Godfather*, *Taxi Driver*, and *Annie Hall* to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.[284] One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, \"When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.\"[284][285] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through *Star Wars* and *Jaws*, Lucas and Spielberg \"didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect\", which was \"a kind of rebirth\".[283]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[286] Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by *Star Wars*, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter,[287] David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith,[281] and later *Star Wars* directors J.\u00a0J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.[288] Lucas's concept of a \"used universe\" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's *Blade Runner* (1982) and *Alien* (1979), James Cameron's *Aliens* (1986) as well as *The Terminator* (1984), George Miller's *Mad Max 2* (1981), and Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001\u20132003).[281] Christopher Nolan cited *Star Wars* as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film *Inception*.[289]\n\n\n\n#### Fan works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars fan films\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the *Star Wars* galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official *Star Wars* Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the *Star Wars* universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[290] Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.[291]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.[292] Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.[293] Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S. have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.[294][295]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Speculative fiction portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![icon](image)Science fiction portal\n\n\n* 501st Legion\n* Architecture of *Star Wars*\n* Comparison of Star Trek and Star Wars\n* Jedi census phenomenon\n* Jediism\n* List of space science fiction franchises\n* List of *Star Wars* characters\n* List of *Star Wars* creatures\n* List of *Star Wars* planets and moons\n* Music of *Star Wars*\n* Physics and *Star Wars*\n* Star Wars Celebration\n* *Star Wars* Day\n* *Star Wars* documentaries\n* *Star Wars: The High Republic*\n* Space warfare in fiction\n* The Force\n* *The Story of Star Wars*\n* Technology in *Star Wars*\n* Wookieepedia, the Star Wars wiki\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The film's release was preceded by its novelization in November 1976.\n2. **^** Most existing spin-off media was made non-canon and rebranded as 'Legends' in April 2014.[2]\n3. **^** Lucas started by researching the inspiration behind Alex Raymond's *Flash Gordon* comic, leading him to the works of author Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2014the *John Carter of Mars* series in particular.[50]\n4. **^** Played by Jake Lloyd as a child in *Episode I*\n5. **^** Each film was released two days later in the U.S.\n6. **^** The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in George Lucas's depiction of a \"used universe\".[132]\n7. **^** Not to be confused with the board game with the same name published in 1990[231]\n8. **^** In his early drafts, Lucas used the plot point of a dictator staying in power with the support of the military.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell\u2014it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves\u2014again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15\u00a0million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77\u201378% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8\u00a0million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799\u00a0billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2\u00a0billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640\u00a0million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2\u00a0billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5\u00a0billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120\u2013140\u00a0million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5\u00a0million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200\u2013250\u00a0million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260\u2013300\u00a0million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260\u2013270\u00a0million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300\u00a0million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1\u00a0million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100\u00a0million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5\u00a0million, including $60\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3\u00a0million), and Sunday ($90.4\u00a0million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314\u00a0million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9\u00a0million on Monday and $33.1\u00a0million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4\u00a0million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3\u00a0million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600\u00a0million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8\u00a0million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700\u00a0million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2\u00a0million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3\u00a0million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800\u00a0million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1\u00a0million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2\u00a0million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680\u00a0million over its first five days for a global debut of $850\u2013950\u00a0million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250\u2013280\u00a0million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5\u00a0million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2\u00a0million (RMB 189\u00a0million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1\u00a0million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300\u00a0million.[163] Overall, the film made $169\u00a0million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9\u00a0million), South Korea ($8.4\u00a0million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1\u00a0million), France ($6\u00a0million), and Italy ($5.8\u00a0million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866\u00a0million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5\u00a0million; RMB 2.22\u00a0billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($47.4\u00a0million), Mexico ($33.1\u00a0million), Australia ($30.8\u00a0million), Brazil ($26\u00a0million), Spain ($13.3\u00a0million), Japan ($13\u00a0million),[152] and Vietnam ($10\u00a0million).[180] It also made $21.6\u00a0million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($68.2\u00a0million), South Korea ($60.3\u00a0million), Mexico ($48.6\u00a0million), and India ($40.9\u00a0million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569\u00a0billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January\u00a02021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632\u00a0million), United Kingdom ($115\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million), Brazil ($86\u00a0million), and Mexico ($78\u00a0million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clich\u00e9d time travel plot \u2013 the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile inflation has eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT*Guinness*' adjusted total for *Titanic* only increased by $102,000,000 between the 2012 (published in 2011) and 2015 editions, a rise of 4.2% shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart, and omitted the gross from a 3D re-release in 2012.[35][38] This chart incorporates the gross of $343,550,770 from the reissue and adjusts it from the 2013 index.[39] *Titanic* grossed a further $762,994 during limited re-releases in 2017 and 2020, but this sum is not represented in the adjusted total.[40]\n\n\nAEThe gross for *Avengers: Endgame* is adjusted from the 2020 index.\n\n\nTFAThe gross for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is adjusted from the 2016 index.\n\n## High-grossing films by year[edit]\n\n\nGlossary: Distributor rentals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000\u2013100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000\u2013800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000\u201322,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 \u2021 | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 \u2021 |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n\u2021Includes revenue from re-releases.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most.

There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"Pixar Movies at the Box Office\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Total: \"Return of the Jedi (1983)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** \"*Titanic* sinks competitors without a trace\". *BBC News*.

Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) \u2013 International Box Office Results: United Kingdom\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Moviegoing became a special event for most people, creating the phenomenon of the big picture.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Spartacus*: \"In the case of *Spartacus*, overseas earnings to 1969 amounted to $12,462,044, while U.S. and Canadian rentals (even including a million-dollar TV sale) were only $10,643,181. But the film failed to show a profit on production costs of $10,284,014 because of the distribution charges and expenses amounting to an additional $15,308,083.\"\n\t* *The Bible*: \"*The Bible\u2014In the Beginning...* (1966) was financed by the Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis from private investors and Swiss banks. He then sold distribution rights outside Italy jointly to Fox and Seven Arts for $15\u00a0million (70 percent of which came from Fox), thereby recouping the bulk of his $18\u00a0million investment. Although *The Bible* returned a respectable world rental of $25.3\u00a0million, Fox was still left with a net loss of just over $1.5\u00a0million. It was the last biblical epic to be released by any major Hollywood studio for nearly twenty years.\"\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A map of the world with different regions colored in correlating to inflation rates](image)Inflation rates around the world vary, complicating inflation adjustment.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) \u2013 International Box Office Results\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Since it's rarely seen today, *The Singing Fool* is frequently confused with *The Jazz Singer*; although besides Jolson and a pervasively maudlin air the two have little in common. In the earlier film Jolson was inordinately attached to his mother and sang \"Mammy\"; here the fixation was on his young son, and \"Sonny Boy\" became an enormous hit. So did the film, which amassed a stunning world-wide gross of $5.9\u00a0million...Some sources give it as the highest gross of *any* film in its initial release prior to *Gone with the Wind*. This is probably overstating it\u2014MGM's records show that *Ben-Hur* and *The Big Parade* grossed more, and no one knows just how much *The Birth of a Nation* brought in. Still, by the standards of the time it's an amazing amount.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n147. **^** Glancy, Mark (1999). *When Hollywood Loved Britain: The Hollywood 'British' Film 1939\u20131945*.

It was the most popular film of the year (from any studio) in both North America and Britain, and its foreign earnings were three times higher than those of any other MGM film released in the 1941\u201342 season. The production cost ($1,344,000) was one of the highest of the season, indicating the studio never thought of the film as a potential loss-maker. When the film earned a worldwide gross of $8,878,000, MGM had the highest profit ($4,831,000) in its history. *Random Harvest* nearly matched the success of *Mrs Miniver* with worldwide earnings of $8,147,000 yielding the second-highest profit in MGM's history ($4,384,000). *Random Harvest* was also the most popular film of the year in Britain, where it proved to be even more popular than Britain's most acclaimed war film, *In Which We Serve*.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *The Merry Widow*: p. 361 Cost: $1,605,000.

It signifies the material appearance or incarnation of a powerful deity, or spirit on Earth.[1][2] The relative verb to \"alight, to make one's appearance\" is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being.[3][4]\n\n\nThe word *avatar* does not appear in the Vedic literature;[5] however, it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE.[6] Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The *Rigveda* describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will.[7][8] The *Bhagavad Gita* expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than *avatar*.[6][4]\n\n\nTheologically, the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu, though the idea has been applied to other deities.[9] Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten Dashavatara of the *Garuda Purana* and the twenty-two avatars in the *Bhagavata Purana*, though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable.[10] The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology. In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari, Durga, Chandi, Chamunda, Mahakali, and Kali are commonly found.[11][12][13] While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.[14] The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.[15][16]\n\n\nIncarnation concepts that are in some aspects similar to *avatar* are also found in Buddhism,[17] Christianity,[5] and other religions.[17]\n\n\nThe scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses, but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev, that formless eternal god is within the human heart, and man is his own savior.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and meaning[edit]\n\n\nThe Sanskrit noun (**avat\u0101ra**, Hindustani: [\u0259\u028b\u02c8ta\u02d0r]) is derived from the Sanskrit prefix *ava-* (down) and the root **t\u1e5b** (to cross over).[20] These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to *-taritum*, *-tarati*, *-r\u012btum*.[3]\n\n\n*Avatar* means \"descent, alight, to make one's appearance\",[3] and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.[20] The word also implies \"to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something\".[3] In Hindu traditions, the \"crossing or coming down\" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from \"eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude\".[5] An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a *saguna* (with form, attributes) embodiment of the *nirguna* Brahman or Atman (soul).[21] Avatar, according to \nBhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati actually means 'Divine Descent' in his commentaries of The Shrimad Bhagavatam and The Bramha Samhita (mentioned in Brahmavaivarta Purana).\n\n\nNeither the Vedas nor the Principal Upanishads ever mention the word *avatar* as a noun.[5] The verb roots and form, such as *avatarana*, appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as \"action of descending\", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).[22] The related verb *avatarana* is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as \"laying down the burden of man\" suffering from the forces of evil.[22]\n\n\nThe term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god Vishnu.[1][3] The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to establish Dharma on Earth, uses other terms such as the word *sambhav\u0101mi* in verse 4.6 and the word *tanu* in verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita,[4] as well as other words such as *akriti* and *rupa* elsewhere.[23] It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.[6] The idea proliferates thereafter, in the Puranic stories for many deities, and with ideas such as *ansha-avatar* or partial embodiments.[4][1]\n\n\nThe term *avatar*, in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas.[20] In some contexts, the term *avatara* just means a \"landing place, site of sacred pilgrimage\", or just \"achieve one's goals after effort\", or retranslation of a text in another language.[3] The term *avatar* is not unique to Hinduism even though the term originated with Hinduism. It is found in the *Trikaya* doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.[17]\n\n\n\n### Avatar versus incarnation[edit]\n\n\nThe manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an incarnation.[24] The translation of avatar as \"incarnation\" has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.[25][26] The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in Christology, presents the Christian concept of incarnation. The term avatar in Hinduism refers to act of various gods taking form to perform a particular task which in most of the times is bringing dharma back. The concept of avatar is widely accepted all over the India.[27] Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.[28][note 1] Avatars are embodiments of spiritual perfection, driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism.[28] The concept of the avatar in Hinduism is not incompatible with natural conception through a sexual act, which is again different from the Christian concept of the Virgin Birth.\n\n\n\n### As a loanword[edit]\n\n\nFollowing 19th Century Western interest in Indian culture and Hinduism, the word \"Avatar\" was taken as loanword into English and other Western languages, where it is used in various contexts and meanings, often considerably different from its original meaning in Hinduism - see Avatar (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Vishnu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vishnu\n\nThe concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring Dharma. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as \"Hindu\", but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold.[30] An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:[9][26]\n\n\n\n\n> Arjuna, whenever righteousness is on the decline, unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.  \n> \n> For the protection of the virtuous, for the extirpation of evil-doers, & for establishing Dharma (righteousness) on a firm footing, I manifest Myself from age to age.\n> \u2014\u200aBhagavad Gita 4.7\u20138\n> \n\n\nThe Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.[31] The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.[31]\n\n\nThe most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.[26] The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.[32]\n\n\n\n### Dashavatara[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dashavatara\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations, the Dashavatara, are celebrated therein as his major appearances.[10][26] The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the Agni Purana, the Garuda Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.[33][34]\n\n\nThe ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the *Dashavatara* (a Sanskrit compound meaning \"ten avatars\"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avatars of Vishnu\n| Name\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Matsya | The fish avatar. He saves Manu and the seven sages from the cosmic flood, and in some traditions, saves the Vedas from an asura called Hayagriva.[36] |\n| Kurma[note 2] | The tortoise/turtle avatar. He supports the mountain named Mandara while the devas and the asuras churn the ocean of milk to produce the nectar of immortality.[38] |\n| Varaha | The boar avatar.

He saves his devotee Prahlada and frees the three worlds from the tyranny of an asura named Hiranyakashipu.[40] |\n| Vamana | The dwarf avatar. He vanquishes the asura king Mahabali to the netherworld after taking three strides upon the universe, restoring the rule of Indra.[41] |\n| Parashurama | The warrior-sage avatar. He destroys the oppressive kings of the military class and creates a new social order.[42] |\n| Rama | The prince avatar. He rescues his wife Sita when she is abducted by the rakshasa king Ravana, restoring just rule to the world.[43] |\n| Balarama (debated)\n | The elder brother of Krishna and the god of agriculture. He is variously described as an avatar of Shesha, the serpent-mount of Vishnu, and an avatar of Vishnu.[44] |\n| Krishna | The eighth avatar of Vishnu who incarnates to re-establish righteousness in the world. He slays Kamsa, the tyrant of Mathura and his uncle, and participates in the Kurukshetra War as the charioteer of Arjuna.[45] |\n| Buddha (debated)\n | The historical Buddha, who incarnates to delude the asuras from the path of the Vedas, ensuring the victory of the devas.

One approach was to identify full avatars and partial avatars. Krishna, Rama, and Narasimha were full avatars (*purna avatars*), while others were partial avatars (*ansha avatars*).[29] Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an *avatar* of Vishnu.[29] The Pancharatra text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatars include those that are direct and complete (*sakshad*), indirect and endowed (*avesha*), cosmic and salvific (*vyuha*), inner and inspirational (*antaryamin*), consecrated and in the form of image (*archa*).[29]\n\n\nYet another classification, developed in Krishna schools, centers around *Guna-avatars*, *Purusha-avatars* and *Lila-avatars*, with their subtypes.[53][54] The *Guna-avatar* classification of *avatars* is based on the Gu\u1e47as concept of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, that is Rajas (Brahma), Sattva (Vishnu), and Tamas (Shiva).[53][54] These personalities of the Trimurti are referred to as *Guna avatars*.[53] The *Purushavatara* are three. The first evolves all matter (Prakriti), the second is the soul present in each individual creature, the third is the interconnected oneness or Brahman that connects all souls.[53][55] The *Lilavataras* are partial or full manifestations of Vishnu, where either some powers (Shakti) or material parts of him exist.[53][54]\n\n\nVishnu is Purushavatara.[56][57] The Matsya, Kurma, and Vamana avatars of Vishnu are Lilavataras.[54][56] A *Purnarupa* in this classification, is when Vishnu manifests completely along with his qualities and powers. In Bengal Vaishnavism, Krishna is the *Purnarupa*.[53] In Shaivism, Bhairava is the purnarupa of Shiva.[58]\n\n\n\n### In Sikhism[edit]\n\n\n24 avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in Bachitar Natak's composition in Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhism written by Guru Gobind Singh:[59]\n\n\n\n1. Mach (Matsya)\n2. Kach (Kurma)\n3. Nara (Nara in Nara-Narayana)\n4. Narayan (Narayana in Nara-Narayana)\n5. Maha Mohini (Mohini)\n6. Bairaha (Varaha)\n7. Nar Singha (Narasimha)\n8. Baman (Vamana)\n9. Parshuram (Parashurama)\n10. Bramma (Brahma)\n11. Balram (Balarama)\n12. Jalandhar (Jalandhara)\n13. Bishan (Vishnu)\n14. Sheshayi (Shesha)\n15. Arihant Dev (Arihanta)\n16. Manu Raja (Manu)\n17. Dhanvantari (Dhanvantari)\n18. Suraj (Surya)\n19. Chandar (Chandra)\n20. Ram (Rama)\n21. Kishan (Krishna)\n22. Nar (Arjuna)\n23. Rudra (Shiv)\n24. Kalki (Kalki)\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib reverentially includes the names of numerous Hindu deities, including Vishnu avatars such as Krishna, Hari, and Rama, as well those of Devi as Durga.[60][61][62]\n\n\nDasam Granth has three major compositions, one each dedicated to avatars of Vishnu (Chaubis avatar) and Brahma.[59][63] However, Sikhism rejects the doctrine of savior incarnation, and only accepts the abstract *nirguna* formless god.[18][64] The Sikh Gurus endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev (\u22481270 \u2013 1350 CE) that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior.[18][65]\n\n\n\n### In Isma'ilism[edit]\n\n\nThe Gupti Ismailis, who observe pious circumspection as Hindus, uphold that the first Shi\u2018i Imam, \u2018Ali b. Abi Talib, as well as his descendants through the line of Isma\u2018il, are collectively Kalki, the tenth and final *avat\u0101ra* of Vishnu. According to this interpretation, these figures represent the continuity of divine guidance to humankind. In the view of some Guptis, this is corroborated by the Quranic verse 14:4 which mentions the idea that God had sent a messenger to every land. They understand the *avat\u0101ras* to be these messengers sent by God to their people in the Indian subcontinent.[66]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Shiva[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sharabha (right) with Narasimha (18th-century painting, Pahari/Kangra School)\nAlthough Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the avatar doctrine is neither universally accepted nor commonly adopted in Shaivism.[67] The views on the doctrine of incarnation has been one of the significant doctrinal differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism, in addition to their differences on the role of householder life versus monastic life for spiritual release.[15][16][68] Shaivism is a transcendental theology, where man, with the help of his Guru, is his own savior.[68]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana lists twenty-eight avatars of Shiva.[69] In the Shiva Purana there is a distinctly Saivite version of a traditional avatar myth: Shiva brings forth Virabhadra, one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu. When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird Sharabha which calms down lion-man Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, and Shiva then gives Vishnu a chakra (not to be confused with Sudarshan Chakra) as gift. A similar story is told in the late medieval era Sharabha Upanishad.[70] However, Vaishnava Dvaita school refutes this Shaivite view of Narasimha.[71] According to the Shiva Purana, Lord Shiva has 19 avatars. According to the Kurma Purana, he has 28.\n\n\nThe vanara god Hanuman who helped Rama (the Vishnu avatar) is considered by some to be the eleventh avatar of Rudra (Shiva).[72][73] Some regional deities like Khandoba are also believed by some to be avatars of Shiva.[74][75]\nAshwatthama, the son of Drona is also considered to be an Avatar of Lord Shiva.\n\n\nShesha and his avatars (Balarama and Lakshmana) are occasionally linked to Shiva.[76][77][78][79] Adi Shankara, the formulator of Advaita Vedanta, is also occasionally regarded as an avatar of Shiva.[80]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.[81]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Devis[edit]\n\n\n![An 18th century painting of the goddess Durga fighting Mahishasura](image)\n![A ca. 1910 chromolithograph of Kali trampling Shiva by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![An early 20th century chromolithograph of Sita in exile by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![The Hindu deity Parvati, 1050-1100 AD India](image)\nAvatars of Devi. Clockwise from upper left: Durga, Kali, Parvati and Sita.\n\nAvatars are also observed in Shaktism, the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (Devi), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous as \u2013 much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the avatars of Vishnu.[82]\n\n\nNilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana\u00a0\u2013 which includes the Devi Gita\u00a0\u2013 says that various avatars of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama\u00a0\u2013 generally thought to be Vishnu's avatars.[83] Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati are main goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.[84]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Parvati[edit]\n\n\nDevi is popular in her form as Parvati. In Devi Mahatmya she is seen as the Goddess Mahakali, and in Uma Samhita, she is seen as Devi herself. Regarding her incarnations, it varies per sect in Hinduism. She could be all Goddesses as said in Shaivism and some main Shatism interpretations like the Sri kula and Kali Kula families, or just a form of Devi in some other Shaktism interpretations and many Vaishnava interpretations. With this in mind, Parvati's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahakali\n* Sati\n* Mahavidyas- Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi\n* The 64 Shakti Peethas\n* Navadurgas - Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri\n* Annapurna\n* Kaushiki\n* Durga\n* Shitala\n* Maheshwari\n* Ardhanarishvara\n* Vindhyavasini\n* Bhramari\n* Shakambhari\n* Raktadantika\n* Twarita\n* In North India- Khodiyar, Bahuchara Mata, Naina Devi, Jwala etc.\n* In Western India- Bhavani, Saptashrungi, Ekvira, Amba etc.\n* In East India-Dakshina Kali, Kamakhya, Jagadhatri etc.\n* In South India- Meenakshi, Vishalakshi, Kamakshi, Abhirami, Mookambika, Akilandeswari, Mariamman, Karumariamman etc.\n\n\nAll of these incarnations helped provide security to the world and even brought Shiva into the participation of worldly affairs.[85]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Lakshmi[edit]\n\n\nLike Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as in many forms to help provide order and to enlighten the world with her consort. She has many forms, and just like Parvati, some of her forms are not consistent throughout all sects and interpretations of Hinduism. In Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, Lakshmi is seen as Devi herself. She could be every Goddess as said in Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, or just another form of Devi as seen in other interpretations of Shaktism and in Shaivism. With this in mind, Lakshmi's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahalakshmi\n* At 108 Divya Desam\n* Ashtalakshmi - Adi Lakshmi, Dhanya Lakshmi, Dhana Lakshmi, Gaja Lakshmi, Santana Lakshmi, Vidya Lakshmi, Veera Lakshmi, Vijaya Lakshmi\n* With avatars of Vishnu - Sita, Radha, Gopi, Rukmini, Ashtabharya, Junior wives of Krishna, Padmavathi, Lakshmi Narayana, Andal, Dharini\n* Singular forms - Vedavati, Chottanikkara Bhagavathy, Mookambika devi, Vaishno Devi, As Kolhapur ambabai\n* Matrikas - Vaishnavi, Varahi, Narasimhi\n* Wives of Vishnu - Sri, Bhumi, Nila\n* Mahavidya Kamalatmika\n\n\n## Avatars of Brahma[edit]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, second scriptures of Sikhs written by Guru Gobind Singh, mentioned seven Brahma Avatars.[86]\n\n\n\n1. Valmiki\n2. Kashyapa\n3. Shukra\n4. Baches\n5. Vyasa\n6. Khat\n7. Kalidasa\n\n\nKhat avatar in this list refers to six different scholars who are considered to be founders of six schools of Indian philosophy.[87] According to the Skanda Purana, Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Shiva.[88]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Ganesha[edit]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.[89] The two Upapuranas\u00a0\u2013 Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana\u00a0\u2013 detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the Ganapatya sect\u00a0\u2013 exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.\n\n\nFour avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, May\u016bre\u015bvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose\u00a0\u2013 to slay demons.[90]\n\n\nThe Mudgala Puranam describes eight avatars of Ganesha:[91]\n\n\n\n1. Vakratunda (*Vakratu\u1e47\u1e0da*) (\"twisting trunk\"), his mount is a lion.\n2. Ekadanta (\"single tusk\"), his mount is a mouse.\n3. Mahodara (\"big belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n4. Gajavaktra (or Gaj\u0101nana) (\"elephant face\"), his mount is a mouse.\n5. Lambodara (\"pendulous belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n6. Vikata (*Vika\u1e6da*) (\"unusual form\", \"misshapen\"), his mount is a peacock.\n7. Vighnaraja (*Vighnar\u0101ja*) (\"king of obstacles\"), his mount is the celestial serpent *\u015ae\u1e63a*.\n8. Dhumravarna (*Dh\u016bmravar\u1e47a*) (\"grey color\") corresponds to \u015aiva, his mount is a horse.\n\n\n## Avatars of Varuna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jhulelal, incarnation of Varuna\nJhulelal, the I\u1e63\u1e6da-devat\u0101 (most-revered deity) of Sindhi Hindus, is considered the incarnation of Varuna.[92]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Hinduism portal\n* ![](image)Philosophy portal\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n\n\n* Abatur\n* Avatars in the Mahabharata\n* Dashavatara\n* Gautama Buddha in Hinduism\n* Incarnation\n* List of avatar claimants\n* Hindu eschatology\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.[29]\n2. **^** Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu, appears in stories about the Kurma avatar.[37]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** James Lochtefeld (2002), \"Avatar\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, ISBN\u00a00-8239-2287-1, pages 72\u201373\n2. **^** Geoffrey Parrinder (1997). *Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions*.

At the end of the meditation a drop of perspiration was produced from his forehead. That drop, of the shape of a bubble, in a moment fell on the earth. O you of an excellent face, I, having three eyes, a trident, and adorned with the crown of the matted hair, was born from that bubble. With modesty I asked the lord of gods: \"What shall I do?\" Then God Visnu, with delight, thus spoke to me: \"O Rudra, you will bring about a fierce-looking destruction of the world, (after) actually being (my) portion, viz. Samkarsana, O you of an excellent face.\"\n78. **^** Mahalik, Er. Nirakar (2010). \"Lord Balarama\" (PDF). *Orissa Review*. So Balarama became (Bala+Deva) Baladeva.

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship.[4] The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.\n\n\nRMS *Titanic* was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three *Olympic*-class ocean liners built for the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. *Titanic* was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nThe first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Turkish bath, and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's operational use. *Titanic* had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as \"unsinkable\".\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats. However, she actually carried only 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while she was sinking (Collapsible A nearly swamped and was filled with a foot of water until rescue; Collapsible B completely overturned while launching). Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people\u2014about half the number of passengers on board, and one-third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nGaumont newsreel containing the only known footage of *Titanic*, 1912\nThe name *Titanic* derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS *Titanic* was the second of the three *Olympic*-class ocean liners\u2014the lead vessel was RMS\u00a0*Olympic* and the final ship in the class was HMHS\u00a0*Britannic*.[5] They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.[6] The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).\n\n\nThe White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, Cunard\u2014which had recently launched *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, the fastest passenger ships then in service\u2014and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury.[7] The White Star Line sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton\u2013Cherbourg\u2013New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, the *Olympic* and *Titanic* would replace RMS\u00a0*Teutonic* of 1889, RMS\u00a0*Majestic* of 1890 as well as RMS\u00a0*Adriatic* of 1907. RMS\u00a0*Oceanic* would remain on the route until the third new ship could be delivered.[*citation needed*] *Majestic* resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service post the loss of *Titanic*'.[8]\n\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.[9] Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.[9] In the case of the *Olympic*-class ships, a cost of \u00a33\u00a0million (approximately \u00a3310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.[10]\n\n\nHarland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing *Olympic*-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.[11] Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment, and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.[b]\n\n\nOn July 29, 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of construction.[14] At this point, the first ship\u2014which was later to become *Olympic*\u2014had no name but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. *Titanic* was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.[15]\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Starboard view of *Titanic*\n*Titanic* was 882\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (269.06\u00a0m) long with a maximum breadth of 92\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (28.19\u00a0m).\n\n\nHer total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32\u00a0m).[16] She measured 46,329\u00a0GRT and 21,831\u00a0NRT[17] and with a draught of 34\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (10.54\u00a0m), she displaced 52,310 tons.[5]\nAll three of the *Olympic*-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:\n\n\n\n* The **boat deck**, on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that *Titanic*'s lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.[18][19]\n* **A Deck**, also called the **promenade deck**, extended along the entire 546 feet (166\u00a0m) length of the superstructure. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, smoke room, reading and writing rooms, and Palm Court.[18]\n* **B Deck**, the **bridge deck**, was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On *Titanic*, the \u00e0 la carte restaurant and the Caf\u00e9 Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings.[c] Aft of the bridge deck was the raised poop deck, 106 feet (32\u00a0m) long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of *Titanic*'s passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by well decks.[20][21]\n* **C Deck**, the **shelter deck**, was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were housed below the poop deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second Class library.[20][22]\n* **D Deck**, the **saloon deck**, was dominated by three large public rooms\u2014the First Class reception room, the First Class dining saloon and the Second Class dining saloon. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second and Third Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).[20][23]\n* **E Deck**, the **upper deck**, was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and trimmers. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed 'Scotland Road', in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.[20][24]\n* **F Deck**, the **middle deck**, was the last complete deck, and mainly accommodated Second and Third Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as were the swimming pool, Turkish bath and kennels.[20][24][25]\n* **G Deck**, the **lower deck**, was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.[20][26]\n* The **orlop decks**, and the **tank top** below that, were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the tank top\u2014the inner bottom of the ship's hull\u2014provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by flights of stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.[20][26]\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)RMS\u00a0*Olympic*'s rudder with central and port wing propellers;[27] the man at the bottom shows scale.[28]\n*Titanic* propulsion was supplied by three main engines\u2014two reciprocating four-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engines and one centrally placed low-pressure Parsons turbine\u2014each driving a propeller. The two reciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000 horsepower (22,000\u00a0kW). The output of the steam turbine was 16,000 horsepower (12,000\u00a0kW).[16] The White Star Line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner, *Laurentic*, where it had been a great success.[29] It provided a good combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an *Olympic*-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*.[30] By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of steam.[31]\n\n\nThe two reciprocating engines were each 63 feet (19\u00a0m) long and weighed 720 tons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons.[30] They were powered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and five single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces.[32] The boilers were 15\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (4.80\u00a0m) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) long, each weighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.[33]\n\n\nThey were fuelled by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in *Titanic*'s bunkers, with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen working around the clock.[34] 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.[35] The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively well,[34] there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.[36]\n\n\nExhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a surface condenser, to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused.[37] The engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of 23.5 feet (7.2\u00a0m).[33] The middle propeller was slightly smaller at 17 feet (5.2\u00a0m) in diameter,[38] and could be stopped but not reversed.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time.[39] Immediately aft of the turbine engine were four 400\u00a0kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide electrical power to the ship, plus two 30\u00a0kW auxiliary generators for emergency use.[40] Their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.[41]\n\n\n*Titanic* lacked a searchlight in accordance with the ban on the use of searchlights in the merchant navy.[42][43]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\n#### Compartments and funnels[edit]\n\n\nThe interiors of the *Olympic*-class ships were subdivided into 16 primary compartments divided by 15 bulkheads that extended above the waterline. Eleven vertically closing watertight doors could seal off the compartments in the event of an emergency.[44] The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and teak, while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated cork to combat condensation.[45] Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted buff with black tops; only three were functional\u2014the aftmost one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes and kitchen ventilation. Two masts, each 155\u00a0ft (47\u00a0m) high, supported derricks for working cargo.\n\n\n\n#### Rudder and steering engines[edit]\n\n\nDue to the size and weight of *Titanic*'s rudder\u2014at 78\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (23.98\u00a0m) high and 15\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (4.65\u00a0m) long, weighing over 100 tons\u2014that it required steering engines to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed, though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short tiller through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.[46] As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam capstans.[47] The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two kedging anchors).[47]\n\n\n\n#### Water, ventilation and heating[edit]\n\n\nThe ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while *Titanic* was in port, but in an emergency, the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Radio communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMarconi Company receiving equipment for a 5-kilowatt ocean liner station (in the picture, the wireless radio room of *Titanic*'s sister ship, *Olympic*)\n![](image)\nThe only known picture of *Titanic*'s wireless radio room, taken by the Catholic priest Francis Browne. Harold Bride is seated at the desk.\n\n*Titanic*'s radiotelegraph equipment (then known as wireless telegraphy) was leased to the White Star Line by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company, which also supplied two of its employees, Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily sending and receiving passenger telegrams (\"marconigrams\"), but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice warnings.[48][49][50]\nThe radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A soundproofed \"Silent Room\", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter and a motor-generator used for producing alternating currents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office. The ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5-kilowatt rotary spark-gap transmitter, with the wireless telegraph call sign MGY, and communication was in Morse code. This transmitter was one of the first Marconi installations to use a rotary spark-gap, which gave *Titanic* a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of 350 miles (304\u00a0nmi; 563\u00a0km). An elevated T-antenna that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was 500\u00a0kHz (600\u00a0m wavelength); however, the equipment could also operate on the \"short\" wavelength of 1,000\u00a0kHz (300\u00a0m wavelength) that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas.[51]\n\n\n\n### Passenger facilities[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First-class facilities of the *Titanic* and Second- and third-class facilities on *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Grand Staircase of *Titanic*\n\nThe passenger facilities aboard *Titanic* aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to *Titanic*'s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a manor house or an English country house.[52]\n\n\n*Titanic* was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high-class hotels\u2014the Ritz Hotel was a reference point\u2014with First Class cabins finished in the Empire style.[52] A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the Renaissance to Louis XV, were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would \"at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore\".[53]\n\n\nAmong the more novel features available to first-class passengers was a 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) deep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, and a Turkish bath which comprised electric bath, steam room, cool room, massage room, and hot room.[53] First-class common rooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated. They included a lounge in the style of the Palace of Versailles, an enormous reception room, a men's smoking room, and a reading and writing room. There was an \u00e0 la carte restaurant in the style of the Ritz Hotel which was run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur Gaspare Gatti.[54] A *Caf\u00e9 Parisien* decorated in the style of a French sidewalk caf\u00e9, complete with ivy-covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the restaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest French *haute cuisine* in the most luxurious of surroundings.[55] There was also a *Verandah Caf\u00e9* where tea and light refreshments were served, that offered grand views of the ocean. At 114\u00a0ft (35\u00a0m) long by 92\u00a0ft (28\u00a0m) wide, the dining saloon on D Deck, designed by Charles Fitzroy Doll, was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600 passengers at a time.[56]\n\n\n\n* ![The Forward First Class Grand Staircase of Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic.

They reflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for trans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities. \n\n\nThe White Star Line had long since broken that mould. As seen aboard *Titanic*, all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and ten passengers.[57]\n\n\nThird Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard *Titanic* comprised the poop deck at the stern, the forward and aft well decks, and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a general room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper-class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.\n\n\nLeisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.[58]\n\n\nOne of *Titanic*'s most distinctive features was her First Class staircase, known as the Grand Staircase or Grand Stairway. Built of solid English oak with a sweeping curve, the staircase descended through seven decks of the ship, between the boat deck to E deck, before terminating in a simplified single flight on F Deck.[59] It was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the stairwell. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls panelled in the William & Mary style and lit by ormolu and crystal light fixtures.[60]\n\n\nAt the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" flanking the clock face.[59] The Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.[61] During the filming of James Cameron's *Titanic* in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.[62]\n\n\n\n### Mail and cargo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*La Circassienne au Bain* by Merry-Joseph Blondel; the most highly valued item of cargo lost on *Titanic*. This image is of a copy.[d]\nAlthough *Titanic* was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a Royal Mail Ship (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the Royal Mail (and also for the United States Post Office Department). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables), 26,800 cubic feet (760\u00a0m3) of space in her holds was allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks (three Americans and two Britons), who worked 13 hours a day, seven days a week, sorting up to 60,000 items daily.[64]\n\n\nThe ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another 19,455 cubic feet (550.9\u00a0m3) was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs, and a 1912 Renault Type CE Coupe de Ville motor car.[65] Despite later myths, the cargo on *Titanic*'s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, exotic minerals or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the *Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam*, was valued at only \u00a3405 (\u00a350,600 today).[66] According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled *La Circassienne au Bain* by French artist Merry-Joseph Blondel. The painting's owner, first-class passenger Mauritz H\u00e5kan Bj\u00f6rnstr\u00f6m-Steffansson, filed a claim for $100,000 (equivalent to $2,300,000 in 2023) in compensation for the loss of the artwork.[63]\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the holds. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.[67]\n\n\n\n### Lifeboats[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lifeboats of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)A collapsible lifeboat with canvas sides\nLike *Olympic*, *Titanic* carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65 people each and four Engelhardt \"collapsible\" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two emergency cutters with a capacity of 40 people each.[68][e] *Olympic* carried at least two collapsible boats on either side of her number one funnel.[69][70] All of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats A and B, connected to davits by ropes. Those on the starboard side were odd-numbered 1\u201315 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered 2\u201316 from bow to stern.[71]\n\n\nBoth cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate use, while collapsible lifeboats C and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats 1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number 1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand.[71] Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.\n\n\n*Titanic* had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle four lifeboats as Carlisle had planned. This gave *Titanic* the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats[72] which would have been enough for 4,000 people\u2014considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178 people, only one-third of *Titanic*'s total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to only carry 16 lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.[68]\n\n\nTherefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required.[73][f] At the time, lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship\u2014not keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore. Had SS\u00a0*Californian* responded to *Titanic*'s distress calls, the lifeboats might have been able to ferry all passengers to safety as planned.[75]\n\n\n\n## Building and preparing the ship[edit]\n\n\n### Construction, launch and fitting-out[edit]\n\n\n![Construction in gantry, bow is seen](image)\nConstruction in gantry, 1909\u201311\n![Launch, 1911; ship with unfinished superstructure](image)\nLaunch, 1911 (unfinished superstructure)\n![Fitting-out, 1911\u201312: Ship is seen in dock](image)\nFitting-out, 1911\u201312\n\nThe sheer size of the *Olympic class* vessels posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size.[76] The ships were constructed on Queen's Island, now known as the Titanic Quarter, in Belfast Harbour. Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing slipways and build two new ones, the largest ever constructed up to that time, to accommodate both ships.[10] Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by Sir William Arrol & Co., a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the Forth Bridge and London's Tower Bridge. The Arrol Gantry stood 228 feet (69\u00a0m) high, was 270 feet (82\u00a0m) wide and 840 feet (260\u00a0m) long, and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.[77]\n\n\nThe construction of *Olympic* and *Titanic* took place virtually in parallel, with *Olympic*'s keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and *Titanic*'s on 31 March 1909.[15] Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder, with the keel acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom 5\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.60\u00a0m) deep supported 300 frames, each between 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) and 36 inches (91\u00a0cm) apart and measuring up to about 66 feet (20\u00a0m) long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.[78]\n\n\nThe 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of rolled steel plate, mostly up to 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) wide and 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons.[79] Their thickness varied from 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8\u00a0cm).[44] The plates were laid in a clinkered (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were laid in the \"in and out\" fashion, where strake plating was applied in bands (the \"in strakes\") with the gaps covered by the \"out strakes\", overlapping on the edges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc welding methods, ubiquitous in fabrication today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel rivets, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand.[80] In the 1990s some material scientists concluded[81] that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, by the standards of the time, the steel plate's quality was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the metallurgy of steelmaking.[81] As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.[82][83][84][85][86]\n\n\nAmong the last items to be fitted on *Titanic* before the ship's launch were her two side anchors and one centre anchor. The anchors themselves were a challenge to make, with the centre anchor being the largest ever forged by hand and weighing nearly 16 tons. Twenty Clydesdale draught horses were needed to haul the centre anchor by wagon from the Noah Hingley & Sons Ltd forge shop in Netherton, near Dudley, United Kingdom to the Dudley railway station two miles away. From there it was shipped by rail to Fleetwood in Lancashire before being loaded aboard a ship and sent to Belfast.[87]\n\n\nThe work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,[88] safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was carried out without equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, during *Titanic*'s construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them \"severe\", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.[89] Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.[90]\n\n\n*Titanic* was launched at 12:15\u00a0pm on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpont Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.[91][92] Twenty-two tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the River Lagan.[90] In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne.[91] The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.[93]\n\n\nAlthough *Titanic* was virtually identical to the class's lead ship *Olympic*, a few changes were made to distinguish both ships. The most noticeable exterior difference was that *Titanic* (and the third vessel in class, *Britannic*) had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay, and was intended to provide additional shelter to First Class passengers.[94] Extensive changes were made to B Deck on *Titanic* as the promenade space in this deck, which had proven unpopular on *Olympic*, was converted into additional First Class cabins, including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces. The *\u00c0 la Carte* restaurant was also enlarged and the *Caf\u00e9 Parisien*, an entirely new feature which did not exist on *Olympic*, was added. These changes made *Titanic* slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected due to design changes requested by Ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair *Olympic*, which had been in a collision in September 1911. Had *Titanic* been finished earlier, she might well have missed her collision with an iceberg.[90]\n\n\n\n### Sea trials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Titanic* departing Belfast for sea trials on 2 April 1912\n*Titanic*'s sea trials began at 6\u00a0am on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.[95] The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.[96] Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on *Titanic*'s sea trials: Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff, and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.[97]\n\n\nThe sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in Belfast Lough and then in the open waters of the Irish Sea. Over the course of about 12 hours, *Titanic* was driven at different speeds, her turning ability was tested and a \"crash stop\" was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in 850\u00a0yd (777\u00a0m) or 3 minutes and 15 seconds.[98] The ship covered a distance of about 80 nautical miles (92\u00a0mi; 150\u00a0km), averaging 18 knots (21\u00a0mph; 33\u00a0km/h) and reaching a maximum speed of just under 21 knots (24\u00a0mph; 39\u00a0km/h).[99]\n\n\nOn returning to Belfast at about 7\u00a0pm, the surveyor signed an \"Agreement and Account of Voyages and Crew\", valid for 12 months, which declared the ship seaworthy. An hour later, *Titanic* departed Belfast to head to Southampton, a voyage of about 570 nautical miles (660\u00a0mi; 1,060\u00a0km). After a journey lasting about 28 hours, she arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the port's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of her crew.[100]\n\n\n\n## Maiden voyage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Titanic* at Southampton docks, prior to departure\n![](image)\n*Titanic* in Cork harbour, 11 April 1912\n\nBoth *Olympic* and *Titanic* registered Liverpool as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line, as well as Cunard, were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the *Olympic*, most British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, sailed from Liverpool followed by a port of call in Queenstown, Ireland. Since the company's founding in 1845, a vast majority of their operations had taken place from Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star Line established another service from Southampton on England's south coast, which became known as White Star's \"Express Service\". Southampton had many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its proximity to London.[101]\n\n\nIn addition, Southampton, being on the south coast, allowed ships to easily cross the English Channel and make a port of call on the northern coast of France, usually at Cherbourg. This allowed British ships to pick up clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers at Queenstown. The Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run would become so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after World War I. Out of respect for Liverpool, ships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. *Queen Elizabeth 2* was one of the first ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard in 1969.[101]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many trans-Atlantic crossings between Southampton and New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown on westbound runs, returning via Plymouth in England while eastbound. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December 1912 still exists.[102] When the route was established, four ships were assigned to the service. In addition to *Teutonic* and *Majestic*, RMS\u00a0*Oceanic* and the brand new RMS\u00a0*Adriatic* sailed the route. When the *Olympic* entered service in June 1911, she replaced *Teutonic*, which after completing her last run on the service in late April was transferred to the Dominion Line's Canadian service. The following August, *Adriatic* was transferred to White Star Line's main Liverpool-New York service, and in November, *Majestic* was withdrawn from service impending the arrival of *Titanic* in the coming months, and was mothballed as a reserve ship.[103][104]\n\n\nWhite Star Line's initial plans for *Olympic* and *Titanic* on the Southampton run followed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them. Each would sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually leaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New York, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each direction. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey passengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively.[104] The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the \"*White Star Dock*\", had been specially constructed to accommodate the new *Olympic*-class liners, and had opened in 1911.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crew[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crew of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)Edward Smith, captain of *Titanic*, in 1911\n*Titanic* had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.[106] Like other vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton.[107] The process of signing up recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew during *Titanic*'s sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.[108]\n\n\nCaptain Edward John Smith, the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from *Olympic* to take command of *Titanic*.[109] Henry Tingle Wilde also came across from *Olympic* to take the post of chief mate. *Titanic*'s previously designated chief mate and first officer, William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller, were bumped down to the ranks of first and second officer respectively. The original second officer, David Blair, was dropped altogether.[110][g] The third officer was Herbert Pitman, the only deck officer who was not a member of the Royal Naval Reserve. Pitman was the second-to-last surviving officer.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling, with 494.[111] The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.[112] Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.[113] The rest represented a great variety of professions\u2014bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,[113] who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the *Atlantic Daily Bulletin* with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.[48][h]\n\n\nMost of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;[15] in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.[113] A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class *\u00c0 La Carte* Restaurant and the Caf\u00e9 Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight musicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers.[115] Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's \u00a3105 a month (equivalent to \u00a313,100 today) to the \u00a33 10*s* (\u00a3440 today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.[114]\n\n\n\n### Passengers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Animals aboard *Titanic*\n\n![](image)John Jacob Astor IV in 1909. He was the wealthiest person aboard *Titanic*; he did not survive.\n*Titanic*'s passengers numbered approximately 1,317 people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of whom were in Third Class.[116] The ship was considerably under-capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers\u2014833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006 Third Class.[117]\n\n\nUsually, a high-prestige vessel like *Titanic* could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a national coal strike in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before *Titanic* sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. *Titanic* was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as SS\u00a0*City of New York* and RMS\u00a0*Oceanic*, as well as coal that *Olympic* had brought back from a previous voyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.[94]\n\n\nSome of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard *Titanic*, travelling in First Class. Among them (with those who perished marked with a dagger\u2020) were the American millionaire John Jacob Astor IV\u2020 and his wife, Madeleine Force Astor (with John Jacob Astor VI in utero); industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim\u2020; painter and sculptor Francis Davis Millet\u2020; Macy's owner Isidor Straus\u2020 and his wife, Ida\u2020; Denver millionairess Margaret \"Molly\" Brown;[i] Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, couturi\u00e8re Lucy (Lady Duff-Gordon); Lieut.

Morgan was scheduled to travel on the maiden voyage but cancelled at the last minute.[119] Also aboard the ship were the White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay and *Titanic*'s designer Thomas Andrews\u2020, who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship.[120]\n\n\nThe exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various reasons,[121] and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey.[122] Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares from London, Southampton, or Queenstown cost \u00a37 5*s* (equivalent to \u00a3900 today) while the cheapest First Class fares cost \u00a323 (\u00a32,900 today).[104] The most expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to \u00a3870 in high season (\u00a3109,000 today).[117]\n\n\n\n### Collecting passengers[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage began on Wednesday, 10 April 1912. Following the embarkation of the crew, the passengers began arriving at 9:30\u00a0am, when the London and South Western Railway's boat train from London Waterloo station reached Southampton Terminus railway station on the quayside, alongside *Titanic*'s berth.[123] The large number of Third Class passengers meant they were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith.[124] Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States \u2013 a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic.[121] In all, 920 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Southampton \u2013 179 First Class, 247 Second Class, and 494 Third Class. Additional passengers were to be picked up at Cherbourg and Queenstown.[94]\n\n\nThe maiden voyage began at noon, as scheduled. An accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later, as *Titanic* passed the moored liners SS\u00a0*City of New York* of the American Line and *Oceanic* of the White Star Line, the latter of which would have been her running mate on the service from Southampton. Her huge displacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water and then dropped into a trough. *New York*'s mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards *Titanic*. A nearby tugboat, *Vulcan*, came to the rescue by taking *New York* under tow, and Captain Smith ordered *Titanic*'s engines to be put \"full astern\".[125] The two ships avoided a collision by a distance of about 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m). The incident delayed *Titanic*'s departure for about an hour, while the drifting *New York* was brought under control.[126][127]\n\n\nAfter making it safely through the complex tides and channels of Southampton Water and the Solent, *Titanic* disembarked the Southampton pilot at the Nab Lightship and headed out into the English Channel.[128] She headed for the French port of Cherbourg, a journey of 77 nautical miles (89\u00a0mi; 143\u00a0km).[129] The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast.[130] Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of *Titanic*, tenders had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, SS\u00a0*Traffic* and SS\u00a0*Nomadic*. Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the *Olympic*-class liners and were launched shortly after *Titanic*.[131] (*Nomadic* is the only surviving White Star Line ship) Four hours after *Titanic* left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. There, 274 additional passengers were taken aboard \u2013 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class. Twenty-four passengers left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore, having booked only a cross-Channel passage. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8\u00a0pm *Titanic* weighed anchor and left for Queenstown[132] with the weather continuing cold and windy.[130]\n\n\nAt 11:30\u00a0am on Thursday 11 April, *Titanic* arrived at Cork Harbour on the south coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day, with a brisk wind.[130] Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of *Titanic*'s size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Queenstown \u2013 three First Class, seven Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-Channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard *Titanic*, including one of the last known photographs of the ship. The very last one was taken by another cross-channel passenger Kate Odell.[133] A decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore.[134] *Titanic* weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30\u00a0pm and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.[134]\n\n\n\n### Atlantic crossing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Titanic* itinerary on the Northern Atlantic, from Fastnet Light (Ireland) to Ambrose Light (New York)\n![](image)Ice warnings prior to the accident of 14 April\n*Titanic* was planned to arrive at New York Pier 59[135] on the morning of 17 April.[136] After leaving Queenstown, *Titanic* followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock,[137] a distance of some 55 nautical miles (63\u00a0mi; 102\u00a0km). From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles (1,860\u00a0mi; 3,000\u00a0km) along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as \"the corner\" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. *Titanic* sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177\u00a0mi; 1,895\u00a0km) to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.[138] The final leg of the journey would have been 193 nautical miles (222\u00a0mi; 357\u00a0km) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.[139]\n\n\nFrom 11 April to local apparent noon the next day, *Titanic* covered 484 nautical miles (557\u00a0mi; 896\u00a0km); the following day, 519 nautical miles (597\u00a0mi; 961\u00a0km); and by noon on the final day of her voyage, 546 nautical miles (628\u00a0mi; 1,011\u00a0km). From then until the time of her sinking, she travelled another 258 nautical miles (297\u00a0mi; 478\u00a0km), averaging about 21 knots (24\u00a0mph; 39\u00a0km/h).[140]\n\n\nThe weather cleared as she left Ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind. Temperatures remained fairly mild on Saturday 13 April, but the following day *Titanic* crossed a cold weather front with strong winds and waves of up to 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m). These died down as the day progressed until, by the evening of Sunday 14 April, it became clear, calm, and very cold.[141]\n\n\nThe first three days of the voyage from Queenstown had passed without apparent incident. A fire had begun in one of *Titanic*'s coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage,[142] but passengers were unaware of this situation. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships at the time, due to spontaneous combustion of the coal.[143] The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace.[144] The fire was finally extinguished on 14 April.[145][146] There has been some speculation and discussion as to whether this fire and attempts to extinguish it may have made the ship more vulnerable to sinking.[147][148]\n\n\n*Titanic* received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but Captain Smith ignored them.[149] One of the ships to warn *Titanic* was the Atlantic Line's *Mesaba*.[150] Nevertheless, *Titanic* continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time.[151] Although she was not trying to set a speed record,[152] timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed; ice warnings were seen as advisories, and reliance was placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.[151] It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, SS\u00a0*Kronprinz Wilhelm*, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still completed her voyage, and Smith said in 1907 that he \"could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"[153][j]\n\n\n\n### Sinking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sinking of *Titanic*\n\n![Drawing of sinking in four steps from eyewitness description](image)\nThe sinking, based on Jack Thayer's description. Sketched by L.P. Skidmore on board *Carpathia*.\n![Photo of an iceberg taken the day after the sinking at the place of sinking](image)\nThe iceberg thought to have been hit by *Titanic*, photographed on the morning of 15 April 1912. Note the dark spot just along the berg's waterline, which was described by onlookers as a smear of red paint.\n![\"Untergang der Titanic\", a painting showing a big ship sinking with survivors in the water and boats](image)\n\"Untergang *der Titanic*\", as conceived by Willy St\u00f6wer, 1912\n\nAt 11:40\u00a0pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of *Titanic* and alerted the bridge.[156] First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the iceberg and the engines to be reversed,[157] but it was too late. The starboard side of *Titanic* struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.[k] The hull was not punctured, but rather dented such that its seams buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that *Titanic* would sink, as she could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. She began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.[159]\n\n\nThose aboard *Titanic* were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels,[160][l] *Titanic* only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats.[162] The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.[163] Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water.[164] The \"women and children first\" protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats,[164] and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard. Women and children survived at rates of about 75 percent and 50 percent, while only 20 percent of men survived.[165]\n\n\nBetween 2:10 and 2:15\u00a0am, a little over two and a half hours after *Titanic* struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as the boat deck dipped underwater, and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.[166] As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship broke in two main pieces between the second and third funnels, due to the immense forces on the keel. With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,[167] before foundering at 2:20\u00a0am.[168] It was believed that *Titanic* sank in one piece, but the discovery of the wreck many years later revealed that she had broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed in water at a temperature of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F). Only five who were in the water were helped into the lifeboats, though the lifeboats had room for almost 500 more people.[169]\n\n\nDistress signals were sent by wireless, rockets, and lamp, but none of the ships that responded were near enough to reach *Titanic* before she sank.[170] A radio operator on board SS\u00a0*Birma*, for instance, estimated that it would be 6\u00a0am before the liner could arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, SS\u00a0*Californian*, which was the last to have been in contact before the collision, saw *Titanic*'s flares but failed to assist.[171] Around 4\u00a0am, RMS\u00a0*Carpathia* arrived on the scene in response to *Titanic*'s earlier distress calls.[172]\n\n\nWhen the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.[173] 706 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by *Carpathia* to New York, *Titanic*'s original destination, while 1,517 people died.[106] *Carpathia*'s captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20 large bergs measuring up to 200 feet (61\u00a0m) high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from *Titanic*; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.[174] This area is now known as Iceberg Alley.[175]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath of sinking[edit]\n\n\n### Immediate aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The New York Times* had gone to press 15 April with knowledge of the collision but not the sinking.[176]\n![](image)\nThe International Mercantile Marine Company's statement on Monday 15 April assured that despite the lack of communication from the ship, it was \"unsinkable\".[177]\n\n![](image)\nLondon newsboy Ned Parfett with news of the disaster, as reported on Tuesday, 16 April\n![](image)\n*Titanic* had been scheduled for a 20 April departure, seen in a *New York Times* ad apparently unable to be pulled, overnight, before this 15 April printing.[178]\n\nRMS\u00a0*Carpathia* took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. Her journey was slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.[179] She was, however, able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. The initial reports were confusing, leading the American press to report erroneously on 15 April that *Titanic* was being towed to port by SS\u00a0*Virginian*.[180] Late on the night of 15 April White Star reported a message received saying *Titanic* had sunk, but all her passengers and crew had been transferred to another vessel.[181] Later that day, confirmation came through that *Titanic* had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died.[182] The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal,[183] Southampton,[184] Liverpool and Belfast.[185] It hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking;[186] four out of every five crew members came from this town.[187][m]\n*Carpathia* docked at 9:30\u00a0pm on 18 April at New York's Pier 54 and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain.[190] Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organisations.[191] Many of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia. *Titanic*'s 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer SS\u00a0*Lapland*, where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.[192]\n\n\n*Carpathia* was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to Fiume, Austria-Hungary. Her crew were given a bonus of a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of *Titanic*'s passengers joined to give them an additional bonus of nearly \u00a3900 (\u00a3113,000 today), divided among the crew members.[193]\n\n\nThe ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the pilot boat *New York*, which guided *Carpathia* into harbour, and one even managed to get onto *Carpathia* before she docked.[194] Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards.[195] It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard *Titanic*.[n]\n\n\n\n### Insurance, aid for survivors and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCartoon demanding better safety from shipping companies, 1912\n![](image)\nMolly Brown presenting award to *Carpathia* Captain Arthur Rostron for his service in the rescue\n\nIn January 1912, the hulls and equipment of *Titanic* and *Olympic* had been insured through Lloyd's of London and London Marine Insurance. The total coverage was \u00a31,000,000 (\u00a3102,000,000 today) per ship. The policy was to be \"free from all average\" under \u00a3150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now Willis Group), was 15 *s* (75 *p*) per \u00a3100, or \u00a37,500 (\u00a3940,000 today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days.[197]\n\n\nMany charities were set up to help the survivors and their families, many of whom lost their sole wage earner, or, in the case of many Third Class survivors, everything they owned. In New York City, for example, a joint committee of the American Red Cross and Charity Organization Society formed to disburse financial aid to survivors and dependents of those who died.[198] On 29 April, opera stars Enrico Caruso and Mary Garden and members of the Metropolitan Opera raised $12,000 ($300,000 in 2014)[199] in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of \"Autumn\" and \"Nearer My God To Thee\" were part of the programme.[200] In Britain, relief funds were organised for the families of *Titanic*'s lost crew members, raising nearly \u00a3450,000 (\u00a356,000,000 today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the 1960s.[201]\n\n\nIn the United States and Britain, more than 60 survivors combined to sue the White Star Line for damages connected to loss of life and baggage.[202] The claims totalled $16,804,112 (appr. $419\u00a0million in 2018 USD), which was far in excess of what White Star argued it was responsible for as a limited liability company under American law.[203] Because the bulk of the litigants were in the United States, White Star petitioned the United States Supreme Court in 1914, which ruled in its favour that it qualified as an LLC and found that the causes of the ship's sinking were largely unforeseeable, rather than due to negligence.[204] This sharply limited the scope of damages survivors and family members were entitled to, prompting them to reduce their claims to some $2.5\u00a0million. White Star only settled for $664,000 (appr. $16.56\u00a0million in 2018), about 27% of the original total sought by survivors. The settlement was agreed to by 44 of the claimants in December 1915, with $500,000 set aside for the American claimants, $50,000 for the British, and $114,000 to go towards interest and legal expenses.[202][203]\n\n\n\n### Investigations into the disaster[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic* and British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)**Senate Inquiry**: within five days of the sinking, *The New York Times* published several columns relating to Ismay's conduct\u2014concerning which \"there has been so much comment\".[205] Columns included the statement of attorney Karl H. Behr indicating Ismay had helped supervise loading of passengers in lifeboats, and of William E. Carter stating that he and Ismay boarded a lifeboat only after there were no more women.[205]\nEven before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of the failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-orientated.[206]\n\n\nThe US Senate's inquiry into the disaster was initiated on 19 April, a day after *Carpathia* arrived in New York.[207] The chairman, Senator William Alden Smith, wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all surviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil, which prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was completed on 25 May.[208] The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist, insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing \"his moment to stand on the world stage\". Smith, however, already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on US railroads, and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan, *Titanic*'s ultimate owner.[209]\n\n\nThe British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster was headed by Lord Mersey, and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being run by the Board of Trade, who had previously approved the ship, it was seen by some[*like whom?*] as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being found negligent.[210]\n\n\nEach inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of *Titanic*, crew members of Leyland Line's *Californian*, Captain Arthur Rostron of *Carpathia* and other experts.[211] The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time.[212] The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate,[213] Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings,[214] the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed.[213]\n\n\nNeither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor. The American inquiry concluded that since those involved had followed standard practice, the disaster was an act of God.[215] The British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe,[216] noting that British ships alone had carried 3.5\u00a0million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives,[217] and concluded that Smith had done \"only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position\". Lord Mersey did, however, find fault with the \"extremely high speed (twenty-two knots) which was maintained\" following numerous ice warnings,[218] noting that \"what was a mistake in the case of the *Titanic* would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future\".[216]\n\n\nThe recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.[219] An International Ice Patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea; both measures are still in force today.[220]\n\n\nOn 18 June 1912, Guglielmo Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry regarding the telegraphy. Its final report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient operators maintain a constant service.[221]\n\n\nThe way in which the *Titanic* sank brought to light serious design issues with the *Olympic*-class. This resulted in the *Olympic* receiving a major refit and major design changes for the construction of the *Britannic*.[222]\n\n\nIn August 1912, the liner *Corsican* also struck an iceberg in the Atlantic, severely damaging her bow; however due to the weather being hazy at the time, her speed had been reduced to 'dead slow', so limiting further damage. Although the lifeboats had been swung out, they were not boarded.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Role of SS *Californian*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)SS *Californian*, which had tried to warn *Titanic* of the danger from pack-ice\nOne of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by SS\u00a0*Californian*, which had been only a few miles from *Titanic* but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to her signal rockets. *Californian* had stopped for the night because of icy conditions and warned *Titanic* by radio, but was rebuked by *Titanic*'s senior wireless operator, Jack Phillips.[224]\n\n\nTestimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10\u00a0pm, *Californian* observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10\u00a0pm) that this was a passenger liner.[224] At 11:50\u00a0pm, the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible.[224] Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30\u00a0pm and 1:00\u00a0am, but were not acknowledged.[225] If *Titanic* was as far from the *Californian* as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact *Titanic* by that method. Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached *Titanic* in time to save additional lives.[75]\n\n\nCaptain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00\u00a0pm to spend the night;[226] however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10\u00a0am that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white.[*clarification needed*] Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50\u00a0am and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15\u00a0am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.[227]\n\n\n*Californian* eventually responded. At around 5:30\u00a0am, Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator Cyril Furmstone Evans, informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ship. He got news of *Titanic*'s loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after *Carpathia* had already picked up all the survivors.[228]\n\n\nThe inquiries found that the ship seen by *Californian* was in fact *Titanic* and that it would have been possible for *Californian* to come to her rescue; therefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.[229][o]\n\n\n\n### Survivors and victims[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of the *Titanic*\n\nThe number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, because of a number of factors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists.[231] The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.[232] The tables below use figures from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.[106] While the use of the Marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to *Titanic* before it sank, the use of wireless did bring *Carpathia* in time to rescue some of the survivors who otherwise would have perished due to exposure.[50]\n\n\nThe water temperature was well below normal in the area where *Titanic* sank. It also contributed to the rapid death of many passengers during the sinking. Water temperature readings taken around the time of the accident were reported to be \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F). Typical water temperatures were normally around 7\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u00a0\u00b0F) during mid-April.[233] The coldness of the water was a critical factor, often causing death within minutes for many of those in the water.\n\n\nFewer than a third of those aboard *Titanic* survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard *Carpathia*.[234] The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard *Titanic*. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third-class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third-class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first- and second-class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class.[235] In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.\n\n\nThomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster.[236]\n\n\nThe last living survivor, Millvina Dean from England, who, at only nine weeks old, was the youngest passenger on board, died aged 97 on 31 May 2009.[237] Two special survivors were the stewardess Violet Jessop and the stoker Arthur John Priest,[238] who survived the sinkings of both *Titanic* and HMHS\u00a0*Britannic* and were aboard RMS\u00a0*Olympic* when she was rammed in 1911.[239][240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age/sex\n | Class/crew\n | Number aboard\n | Number saved\n | Number lost\n | Percentage saved\n | Percentage lost\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Children\n | First Class\n | 6\n | 5\n | 1\n | 83%\n | 17%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 24\n | 24\n | 0\n | 100%\n | 0%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 79\n | 27\n | 52\n | 34%\n | 66%\n |\n| Women\n | First Class\n | 144\n | 140\n | 4\n | 97%\n | 3%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 93\n | 80\n | 13\n | 86%\n | 14%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 165\n | 76\n | 89\n | 46%\n | 54%\n |\n| Crew\n | 23\n | 20\n | 3\n | 87%\n | 13%\n |\n| Men\n | First Class\n | 175\n | 57\n | 118\n | 33%\n | 67%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 168\n | 14\n | 154\n | 8%\n | 92%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 462\n | 75\n | 387\n | 16%\n | 84%\n |\n| Crew\n | 885\n | 192\n | 693\n | 22%\n | 78%\n |\n| Total\n | 2,224\n | 710\n | 1,514\n | 32%\n | 68%\n |\n\n\n### Retrieval and burial of the dead[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph](image)Markers of *Titanic* victims, Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia\nOnce the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship CS *Mackay-Bennett* from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to retrieve bodies.[242] Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship *Minia*,[243] lighthouse supply ship *Montmagny* and sealing vessel *Algerine*.[244] Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.[245][p]\n\n\nThe first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS\u00a0*Mackay-Bennett*, found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port.[247] Captain Larnder of the *Mackay-Bennett* and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first-class passengers, justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third-class passengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder identified many of those buried at sea as crew members by their clothing, and stated that as a mariner, he himself would be contented to be buried at sea.[248]\n\n\nBodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax Registrar of Vital Statistics, John Henry Barnstead, developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was set up in the curling rink of the Mayflower Curling Club and undertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist.[248] Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150 bodies, were buried in three Halifax cemeteries, the largest being Fairview Lawn Cemetery followed by the nearby Mount Olivet and Baron de Hirsch cemeteries.[249]\n\n\nIn mid-May 1912, RMS\u00a0*Oceanic* recovered three bodies over 200 miles (320\u00a0km) from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A. When Fifth Officer Harold Lowe and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible A, but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants.[q] After their retrieval from Collapsible A by *Oceanic*, the bodies were buried at sea.[250]\n\n\nThe last *Titanic* body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel *Algerine* on 22 May and buried at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax on 12 June.[251]\n\n\nOnly 333 bodies of *Titanic* victims were recovered, which amounted to one in five of the over 1,500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles, making them difficult to recover. By June, one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.[252]\n\n\nBodies of passengers of the Titanic were numbered as they were brought aboard. Physical characteristics, clothing, identifying marks, and personal effects were all documented. Personal effects were stored separately, labeled with the same body number, and valuables were locked up by the purser. Without enough material or space to handle bodies and their belongings, the crew had to triage. [253]\n\n\n\n## Wreck[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wreck of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)The bow of *Titanic*, photographed in June 2004\n*Titanic* was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.[254] The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over 12,000 feet (3,700\u00a0m) below the surface, where the water pressure is over 6,000 pounds per square inch (40 megapascals),[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] about 400 standard atmospheres. A number of expeditions were mounted to find *Titanic* but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard succeeded.[255][256][257]\n\n\nThe team discovered that *Titanic* had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6\u00a0km) apart in Titanic Canyon off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located 13.2 miles (21.2\u00a0km) from the inaccurate coordinates given by *Titanic*'s radio operators on the night of her sinking,[258] and approximately 715 miles (1,151\u00a0km) from Halifax and 1,250 miles (2,012\u00a0km) from New York.\n\n\nBoth sections struck the seabed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.[259]\n\n\nThe two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately 5 by 3 miles (8\u00a0km \u00d7\u00a05\u00a0km).[260] It contains hundreds of thousands of items, such as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which fell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor.[261] The debris field was also the last resting place of a number of *Titanic*'s victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots\u2014which have proved to be inedible\u2014as the only sign that bodies once lay there.[262]\n\n\nSince its initial discovery, the wreck of *Titanic* has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull.[263] In 2006, it was estimated that within 50 years the hull and structure of *Titanic* would eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.[264]\n\n\n\n![](image)The ship's bell, recovered from the wreck\nMany artefacts from *Titanic* have been recovered from the seabed by RMS Titanic Inc., which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and in a permanent exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.[265] A number of other museums exhibit artefacts either donated by survivors or retrieved from the floating bodies of victims of the disaster.[266]\n\n\nOn 16 April 2012, the day after the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos[267] were released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The photos, taken by Robert Ballard during an expedition led by NOAA in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to *Titanic*'s stern which experts called \"compelling evidence\" that it is the spot where somebody came to rest, and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them.[268] The wreck of the *Titanic* falls under the scope of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state co-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the *Titanic*, and co-operate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.[269][270][271]\n\n\nSubmersible dives in 2019 have found further deterioration of the wreck, including loss of the captain's bathtub.[272] Between 29 July and 4 August 2019, a two-person submersible vehicle that was conducting research and filming a documentary crashed into the wreck. EYOS Expeditions executed the dives. It reported that the strong currents pushed the submersible into the wreck, leaving a red rust stain on the submersible's side. The report did not mention if the *Titanic* sustained damage.[273]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Magellan Ltd., a deep-water seabed-mapping company, announced that they had created a \"digital twin\" of the *Titanic*, showing the wreckage in a level of detail that had never been captured before. The company created the model from some 715,000 3D images, captured over the course of a six-week expedition in the summer of 2022, using two submersibles, named *Romeo* and *Juliet*. They mapped \"every millimetre\" of the wreckage as well as the entire three-nautical-mile (5.6\u00a0km) debris field. Creating the model took about eight months.[274][275]\n\n\nOn 18 June 2023, the submersible *Titan*, operated by OceanGate Expeditions, went missing in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. The submersible, designed to carry five people, was carrying an expedition of tourists to view the wreckage of the *Titanic*.[276][277] On 22 June 2023, the operating company announced that they believe the *Titan* crew were lost at sea after a catastrophic implosion of the submersible,[278] and, six days later, the U.S. Coast Guard announced its discovery of \u201cpresumed human remains\u201d consistent with such an implosion found within recovered remnants of the *Titan*.[279]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)An ice patrol aircraft inspecting an iceberg\nAfter the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea passed in 1914.[280] The convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974.[281] Signatories to the Convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example, in Britain, new \"Rules for Life Saving Appliances\" were passed by the Board of Trade on 8 May 1914 and then applied at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.[282]\n\n\nFurther, the United States government passed the Radio Act of 1912. This Act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations.[283] In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed, it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.[283] In the same year, the Board of Trade chartered the barque *Scotia* to act as a weather ship in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, keeping a look-out for icebergs. A Marconi wireless telegraph was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland.[284][285]\n\n\nFinally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, an agency of the U.S. Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period, there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.[286]\n\n\n\n### Cultural[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural legacy of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)*Titanic* Belfast, photographed in November 2017\n*Titanic* has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable.[r] For more than 100 years, she has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking, memorial postcards sold in huge numbers[287] together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,[288] and even black mourning teddy bears.[289] The sinking inspired many ballads such as \"The Titanic\".[290] Several survivors wrote books about their experiences,[291] but it was not until 1955 that the first historically accurate book \u2013 *A Night to Remember* \u2013 was published.[292]\n\n\nThe first film about the disaster, *Saved from the Titanic*, was released only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its star\u2014the silent film actress Dorothy Gibson. This film is considered lost.[293] The British film *A Night to Remember* (1958) is still widely regarded as the most historically accurate movie portrayal of the sinking.[294] The most financially successful by far has been James Cameron's *Titanic* (1997), which became the highest-grossing film in history up to that time,[295] as well as the winner of 11 Oscars at the 70th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron.[296]\n\n\nThe *Titanic* disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton and Liverpool in England; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and Belfast and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland.[297] A number of museums around the world have displays on *Titanic*; the most prominent is in Belfast, the ship's birthplace (see below). \n\n\nRMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a permanent *Titanic* exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Nevada which features a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull. It also runs an exhibition which travels around the world.[298] In Nova Scotia, Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic displays items that were recovered from the sea a few days after the disaster. They include pieces of woodwork such as panelling from the ship's First Class Lounge and an original deckchair,[299] as well as objects removed from the victims.[300] In 2012 the centenary was marked by plays, radio programmes, parades, exhibitions and special trips to the site of the sinking together with commemorative stamps and coins.[186][301][302][303][304] Royal Mail (whose mail was carried by RMS (Royal Mail Ship) *Titanic*) issued ten 1st class UK postage stamps, each with the \"crown seal\", to mark the centenary of the disaster.[305]\n\n\nIn a frequently commented-on literary coincidence, Morgan Robertson authored a novel called *Futility* in 1898 about a fictional British passenger liner with the plot bearing a number of similarities to the *Titanic* disaster. In the novel, the ship is SS *Titan*, a four-stacked liner, the largest in the world and considered unsinkable; like the *Titanic*, she sinks in April after hitting an iceberg and does not have enough lifeboats.[306]\n\n\n\n#### In Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nIt took many decades before the significance of *Titanic* was promoted in Northern Ireland, where it was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. While the rest of the world embraced the glory and tragedy of *Titanic*, it remained a taboo subject throughout the 20th century in its birth city. The sinking brought tremendous grief and was a blow to Belfast's pride. Its shipyard was also a place many Catholics regarded as hostile.[307] In the latter half of the century, during a 30-year sectarian conflict, *Titanic* was a reminder of the lack of civil rights that in part contributed towards the Troubles. While the fate of *Titanic* remained a well-known story within local households throughout the 20th century, commercial investment in projects recalling RMS *Titanic*'s legacy was modest because of these issues.[308]\n\n\nAfter the Troubles and Good Friday Agreement, the number of overseas tourists visiting Northern Ireland increased.[309] It was subsequently identified in the Northern Ireland Tourism Board's *Strategic Framework for Action 2004\u20132007* that the significance of and interest in *Titanic* globally (partly due to the 1997 film *Titanic*) was not being fully exploited as a tourist attraction.[310] Thus, *Titanic* Belfast was spearheaded, along with some smaller projects, such as a *Titanic* memorial.[311]\n\n\nIn 2012 on the ship's centenary, the *Titanic* Belfast visitor attraction was opened on the site of the shipyard where *Titanic* was built.[312] It was Northern Ireland's second most visited tourist attraction with almost 700,000 visitors in 2016.[313]\n\n\nDespite over 1,600 ships being built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast Harbour, Queen's Island became renamed after its most famous ship, Titanic Quarter in 1995. Once a sensitive story, *Titanic* is now considered one of Northern Ireland's most revered and uniting symbols.[314][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 *Titanic* relics that were an asset of the bankrupt Premier Exhibitions.[315] Eventually, *Titanic* Belfast, Titanic Foundation Limited and the National Museums Northern Ireland joined with the National Maritime Museum as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artefacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. Oceanographer Robert Ballard said he favoured this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where *Titanic* was built) and in Greenwich.[315] The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy court in Jacksonville, Florida. The minimum bid for the 11 October 2018 auction was set at US$21.5\u00a0million (\u00a316.5m) and the consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount.[316][317] On 17 October 2018, *The New York Times* reported that a consortium of three hedge funds\u2014Apollo Global Management, Alta Fundamental Advisers, and PacBridge Capital Partners\u2014had paid US$19.5\u00a0million for the collection.[318] At the time of the purchase, the consortium agreed to continued oversight by the court concerning new exploration or salvage expedition must receive approval from NOAA and the court. Further, the purchase price gives Premier's unsecured creditors an 80% recovery.\n\n\n\n## Appendix[edit]\n\n\nDiagrams of RMS *Titanic*\nDiagram of RMS *Titanic* showing the arrangement of the bulkheads in red.

A project by South African businessman Sarel Gaus was abandoned in 2006, and a project by Australian businessman Clive Palmer was announced in 2012, known as the *Titanic II*.\n\n\nA Chinese shipbuilding company known as Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co., Ltd commenced construction in November 2016 to build a replica ship of the *Titanic* for use in a resort. The vessel was to house many features of the original, such as a ballroom, dining hall, theatre, first-class cabins, economy cabins and swimming pool.[326][327] Tourists were to be able to reside inside the *Titanic* during their time at the resort. It was to be permanently docked at the resort and feature an audiovisual simulation of the sinking, which has caused some criticism.[328] As of 2022, however, it was reportedly only 25% complete,[329] and its website and Twitter account are offline.\n\n\nRMS *Olympic* was the sister ship of the *Titanic*. The interior decoration of the dining salon and the grand staircase were in identical style and created by the same craftsmen. Large parts of the interior of the *Olympic* were later sold and are now in the White Swan Hotel, Alnwick, which gives an impression of how the interior of the *Titanic* looked.\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Transport portal\n* ![icon](image)Oceans portal\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* *Titanic* conspiracy theories\n* *Titanic* in popular culture\n* Seamen's Act\n* Lists of shipwrecks\n* *The Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility*\n\n\n### Comparable disasters[edit]\n\n\n* SS\u00a0*Atlantic*, White Star Line ship lost in 1873 with the greatest loss of life for the company before *Titanic*\n* SS\u00a0*Eastland*, a ship capsizing in 1915 after being fitted with extra lifeboats\n* MS\u00a0*Estonia*\n* RMS\u00a0*Empress of Ireland*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The death toll of the sinking of *Tek Sing* in 1822 is not known exactly, but it may have exceeded that of *Titanic*.\n2. **^** Carlisle would leave the project in 1910, before the ships were launched, when he became a shareholder in Welin Davit & Engineering Company Ltd, the firm making the ship's davits.[12] Wilding was sacked following the *Titanic* disaster, having been unfairly blamed by Pirrie for the ship's loss.[13]\n3. **^** It was kept off-limits to passengers; the famous \"flying\" scene at the ship's bow from the 1997 film *Titanic* would not have been permitted in real life.\n4. **^** Copy of the neoclassical oil painting by Merry-Joseph Blondel[63]\n5. **^** Measurement of lifeboats: **1\u20132:** 25'2\" long by 7'2\" wide by 3'2\" deep; 326.6 cubic feet (9.25\u00a0m3); **3\u201316:** 30' long by 9'1\" wide by 4' deep; 655.2 cubic feet (18.55\u00a0m3) and **A\u2013D:** 27'5\" long by 8' wide by 3' deep; 376.6 cubic feet (10.66\u00a0m3)\n6. **^** Since 1894, when the largest passenger ship under consideration was the Cunard Line's 13,000-ton *Lucania*, the Board of Trade had made no provision to increase the existing scale regarding the number of required lifeboats for larger ships, such as the 46,000-ton *Titanic*. Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale \"from time to time\", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried \"uselessly\" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16 boats in any emergency, he \"did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]\".[74]\n7. **^** He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.[110]\n8. **^** *Titanic* also had a ship's cat, Jenny, who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.[114]\n9. **^** Known afterward as the \"Unsinkable Molly Brown\" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank.\n10. **^** Captain Edward Smith had been in command of *Titanic*'s sister *Olympic* when she in 1911 collided with a warship. Even though that ship was designed to sink others by ramming them, it suffered greater damage than *Olympic*, thereby strengthening the image of the class being unsinkable.[154][155]\n11. **^** The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern ultrasound surveys of the wreck suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than 12 to 13 square feet (1.1 to 1.2\u00a0m2).[158][82]\n12. **^** An incident confirmed this philosophy while *Titanic* was under construction: the White Star liner *Republic* was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.[161]\n13. **^** The Salvation Army newspaper, *The War Cry*, reported that \"none but a heart of stone would be unmoved in the presence of such anguish.

Nearly every one in the crowd had lost a relative.\"[188] It was not until 17 April that the first incomplete lists of survivors came through, delayed by poor communications.[189]\n14. **^** On 23 April, the *Daily Mail* reported: \"Late in the afternoon hope died out. The waiting crowds thinned, and silent men and women sought their homes. In the humbler homes of Southampton there is scarcely a family who has not lost a relative or friend. Children returning from school appreciated something of tragedy, and woeful little faces were turned to the darkened, fatherless homes.\"[196]\n15. **^**  Lord protested his innocence to the end of his life, and many researchers have asserted that the known positions of *Titanic* and *Californian* make it impossible that the former was the infamous \"mystery ship\", a topic which has \"generated ... millions of words and ... hours of heated debates\" and continues to do so.[230]\n16. **^** Most of the bodies were numbered; however, the five passengers buried at sea by *Carpathia* went unnumbered.[246]\n17. **^** Thomson Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.\n18. **^** An example is Daniel Butler's book about RMS *Titanic*, titled *Unsinkable*.\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Ship's time; at the time of the collision, *Titanic*'s clocks were set to 2 hours 2 minutes ahead of Eastern Time Zone and 2 hours 58 minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time.[324]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Titanic History, Facts and Stories\". *Titanic Museum Belfast*.

The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] *Star Wars* is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\n\nThe original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope*, was followed by the sequels *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi* (1983), forming the original *Star Wars* trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode I: The Phantom Menace* (1999), *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* (2002), and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode VII: The Force Awakens* (2015), *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* (2017), and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019).\n\n\nAll nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films *Rogue One* (2016) and *Solo* (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10\u00a0billion, making *Star Wars* the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\"[3] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle.[4] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[5][6][7] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a *Star Wars* planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[8] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[9][10] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.[11][12][13] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections and hyperspace transmission.[14]\n\n\nThe universe of *Star Wars* is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[15] One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as \"an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together\".[16] The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[17] Through training and meditation, those whom \"the Force is strong with\" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[18] It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.[19] The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.[20][21] While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[22]\n\n\nThe franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and empires, such as the evil Galactic Empire.[23] The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts.[24] The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms.[25] In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant.[26] Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments, while illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.[26]\n\n\nThe combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes *Star Wars* a very universal franchise, capable of telling stories of various genres.[27]\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars films\n\n### The Skywalker Saga[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Original trilogy: Episodes IV\u2013VI\n |\n| *Star Wars* | May\u00a025,\u00a01977\u00a0(1977-05-25) | George Lucas | Gary Kurtz | [28][29] |\n| *The Empire Strikes Back* | May\u00a021,\u00a01980\u00a0(1980-05-21) | Irvin Kershner | Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan | George Lucas\n | [30][31] |\n| *Return of the Jedi* | May\u00a025,\u00a01983\u00a0(1983-05-25) | Richard Marquand | Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas\n | Howard Kazanjian | [32][33] |\n| Prequel trilogy: Episodes I\u2013III\n |\n| *The Phantom Menace* | May\u00a019,\u00a01999\u00a0(1999-05-19) | George Lucas | George Lucas\n | George Lucas\n | Rick McCallum | [34] |\n| *Attack of the Clones* | May\u00a016,\u00a02002\u00a0(2002-05-16) | George Lucas and Jonathan Hales | [35][36] |\n| *Revenge of the Sith* | May\u00a019,\u00a02005\u00a0(2005-05-19) | George Lucas\n | [37][38] |\n| Sequel trilogy: Episodes VII\u2013IX\n |\n| *The Force Awakens* | December\u00a018,\u00a02015\u00a0(2015-12-18) | J.

Abrams and Michelle Rejwan | [42][43] |\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\".[44] The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning *in media res* with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983. This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019.[45]\n\n\nEach trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith lord Palpatine (Darth Sidious).[46] The original trilogy depicts the heroic development of Luke Skywalker as a Jedi and his fight against Palpatine's Galactic Empire alongside his sister, Leia.[47] The prequels tell the tragic backstory of their father, Anakin, who is corrupted by Palpatine and becomes Darth Vader.[48] The sequels feature Leia's son, Ben Solo, and Luke and Leia's proteg\u00e9, Rey, thirty years after the fall of the Empire.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Original trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars original trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe original trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and James Earl Jones (Darth Vader's voice).\n\nIn 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the *Flash Gordon* serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera.[50][c] After directing *American Graffiti* (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in.[51][52] By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.[53] Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost.[54]\n\n\n*Star Wars* was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope* in the 1979 book *The Art of Star Wars*.[55] The film's success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.[56] With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies.[57] *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi*, was released on May 25, 1983.\n\n\n\n#### Prequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars prequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe prequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Natalie Portman (Padm\u00e9 Amidala), Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker),[d] and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine).\n\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.[58] In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,[59] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.[60] In 1983, Lucas explained that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.\"[61]\n\n\nTechnical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be \"unbelievably expensive\".[62] In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.[63] A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 \"updated\" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.[64]\n\n\n*Episode I: The Phantom Menace* was released on May 19, 1999, *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* on May 16, 2002, and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* on May 19, 2005.[65] The first two films were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as \"the tragedy of Darth Vader\".[66]\n\n\n\n#### Sequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars sequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe sequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron).\n\nPrior to releasing the original 1977 film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films\".[57][67] However, he announced to *Time* in 1978 that he planned \"10 sequels\".[68] He confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981.[69] At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic,[70] the return of Luke as a Jedi Master (a role similar to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy),[67] Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia),[58] Han, Leia,[71] R2-D2 and C-3PO.[57][72] However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that *Star Wars* was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.[73][74]\n\n\nLucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more *Star Wars* films.[75] That October, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that *Episode VII* would be released in 2015.[76] The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president and served as executive producer of new *Star Wars* feature films.[77] Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,[78] but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.[79][80] The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the *Star Wars* Expanded Universe stories, which were discarded from canon to give \"maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience.\"[2]\n\n\n*Episode VII: The Force Awakens* was released on December 16, 2015, *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* on December 13, 2017, and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* on December 18, 2019, in many countries.[e] *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi* were both critical and box office successes.[81][82] *Episode IX* received a mixed reception from critics and audiences.[83]\n\n\n\n### Standalone films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story* | December\u00a016,\u00a02016\u00a0(2016-12-16) | Gareth Edwards | Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy | John Knoll and Gary Whitta | Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Shearmur and Simon Emanuel\n | [84] |\n| *Solo: A Star Wars Story* | May\u00a025,\u00a02018\u00a0(2018-05-25) | Ron Howard | Jonathan Kasdan & Lawrence Kasdan\n | [85] |\n\n\nSeveral *Star Wars* films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga. In 2008, Lucasfilm released the animated film *The Clone Wars*, which is set during the prequel trilogy and serves as the theatrical pilot of the television series of the same name.[86] Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, an \"anthology\" film series set between the main episodes of the Skywalker Saga entered development in parallel with the production of the sequel trilogy,[87] described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe anthology films' main casts include (from left to right) Felicity Jones (Jyn Erso) and Diego Luna (Cassian Andor) from *Rogue One* and Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo) and Woody Harrelson (Tobias Beckett) from *Solo*.\n\nThe first film released was *Rogue One* in 2016, which tells the story of the rebels who steal the plans for the Death Star, the Galactic Empire's superweapon, just before the events of the original *Star Wars* film.[89][90] A second film, *Solo*, was released in 2018 and tells the backstory of original trilogy character Han Solo several years prior to the original *Star Wars* film.[91] The television series *Obi-Wan Kenobi* was originally planned as a film, but changed to a limited series due to *Solo* underperforming at the box office.[92]\n\n\n\n### Upcoming films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Status\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Untitled *New Jedi Order* film\n | TBA\n | Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy | Steven Knight | Kathleen Kennedy\n | In development\n | [93] |\n| Untitled *Dawn of the Jedi* film\n | James Mangold | [93] |\n| Untitled *New Republic* film\n | Dave Filoni | [93] |\n\n\nIn April 2023, three new *Star Wars* films were announced to be set within different eras of the franchise.[94] An untitled film written and directed by James Mangold will be set during the \"dawn of the Jedi\".[94] Dave Filoni will direct a film set between the original and sequel trilogies during the New Republic era, serving as the climax of the various live-action television series that began with *The Mandalorian* in 2019.[94] Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will direct a third film about a new Jedi Order, set fifteen years after the sequel trilogy.[93][95]\n\n\n\n#### Other potential projects[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm has a number of *Star Wars* films in various stages of development, including: \n\n\n\n* **Untitled Rian Johnson trilogy**: In November 2017, a trilogy of movies written by *The Last Jedi* writer/director Rian Johnson was announced to be in development.[96][97] In April 2023, Kennedy stated that trilogy of films is still in open development at the studio, with the writer/director working on the story, although it is not currently a priority.[98]\n* **Untitled David Benioff & D.B. Weiss trilogy**: In February 2018, it was announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would serve as writers and producers on a trilogy of new *Star Wars* movies.[99] The plot would take place chronologically before the Prequel Trilogy, and center around the origin of the Jedi.[100] By May 2019, the duo were also slated to serve as co-directors of the first installment in their three films.[101] In October of the same year however, the filmmaking duo exited development of the projects due to scheduling conflicts with projects they are developing for Netflix. Kennedy stated that the studio is open to working with the duo, and developing their films once their schedule allows it.[102]\n* **Untitled Taika Waititi film**: In May 2020, Taika Waititi signed onto the project which was stated to be the first priority for the studio, with the filmmaker Waititi serving as director from a script he is co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.[103] In May 2022, the movie was named as the next *Star Wars* film to begin production ahead of *Rogue Squadron*, with Kennedy stating that the studio was tentatively looking towards late 2023 for a debut, but had not yet officially set a release date.[104][105] By April 2023, she stated that the project is still in development, with Waititi continuing to work on the script.[106][98]\n* ***Rogue Squadron***: An anthology film, following the events of *Rogue One*, will be directed by Patty Jenkins with a script written by Matthew Robinson.[107] In April 2023, Kennedy stated that the script is still in development, with the studio considering changing the project into a television series.[108]\n* **Untitled J.D. Dillard film**: In February 2020, a film was announced to be in development from director J. D. Dillard and writer Matt Owens;[109] although, Dillard announced he was no longer to direct that film in November 2022.[110]\n* ***Star Wars: A Droid Story***: In December 2020, an animated film centered around the adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO was announced as being in development; the story will introduce a new heroic character to the franchise, alongside these characters. The project will be a joint-venture production between Lucasfilm Animation, and Industrial Light & Magic. The film is being developed to debut via streaming, exclusively through Disney+.[111][112][113]\n* **Untitled Shawn Levy film**: In November 2022, Shawn Levy entered talks to direct a *Star Wars* film, following his work on *Deadpool 3* (2024) and the fifth and final season of *Stranger Things*.[114]\n* **Untitled Lando film**: A film focused on original trilogy character Lando Calrissian, reported to be written by Donald Glover (who portrayed the character in *Solo*) and Stephen Glover.[115]\n\n\n## Television[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars television series\n\n### Live-action series[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise includes several live-action series. The first series, *The Mandalorian*, was released in 2019 for the streaming service Disney+ and is set between the original and sequel trilogies of the Skywalker Saga.[116] Due to its success, the series spawned multiple live-action spin-offs set during the same fictional era, including *The Book of Boba Fett*, released in 2021; *Ahsoka*, released in 2023; and the upcoming *Skeleton Crew*.[117][118][119] These series follow the plight of the New Republic and its allies against the remnants of the fallen Galactic Empire.[120]\n\n\nA story focused on Obi-Wan Kenobi, a character from the original *Star Wars* trilogy, was planned as a film before becoming a live-action series after the box office failure of *Solo* in 2018.[92] The series was released on Disney+ in 2022 and is set between the prequel and original trilogy films.[121] It was followed by the live-action series *Andor* in the same year; both series follow their titular characters during the reign of the Empire.[121][122]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Live-action series** |\n| *The Mandalorian* | 3 | 24 | November\u00a012,\u00a02019\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2019-11-12\u00a0\u2013 present) | Disney+ |\n| *The Book of Boba Fett* | 1 | 7 | December\u00a029,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 February\u00a09,\u00a02022\u00a0(2021-12-29\u00a0\u2013 2022-02-09) |\n| *Obi-Wan Kenobi* | 1 | 6 | May\u00a027\u00a0\u2013 June\u00a022,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-05-27\u00a0\u2013 2022-06-22) |\n| *Andor* | 1 | 12 | September\u00a021,\u00a02022\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2022-09-21\u00a0\u2013 present) |\n| *Ahsoka* | 1 | 8 | August\u00a022\u00a0\u2013 October\u00a03,\u00a02023\u00a0(2023-08-22\u00a0\u2013 2023-10-03) |\n| **Game shows** |\n| *Jedi Temple Challenge* | 1 | 10 | June\u00a010\u00a0\u2013 August\u00a05,\u00a02020\u00a0(2020-06-10\u00a0\u2013 2020-08-05) | StarWarsKids.com |\n\n### Animated series[edit]\n\n\nThe first two animated series, *Droids* and *Ewoks*, were produced in the 1980s.[123] They were followed by the *Clone Wars* animated micro-series in 2003 and the 2008 series of the same name. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, all animated series released prior to 2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise's canon.[2] Subsequent animated series include *Rebels*, released in 2014; *Resistance*, released in 2018; and *The Bad Batch*, released in 2021. \n\n\nSeveral micro-series and shorts have also been released by Lucasfilm since Disney's acquisition, with the earlier animated series falling under Disney's \"Vintage\" collection of *Star Wars* content.[124][125]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Animated series** |\n| *Droids* | 1 | 13 | September\u00a07,\u00a01985\u00a0\u2013 June\u00a07,\u00a01986\u00a0(1985-09-07\u00a0\u2013 1986-06-07) | ABC |\n| *Ewoks* | 2 | 26 | September\u00a07,\u00a01985\u00a0\u2013 December\u00a013,\u00a01986\u00a0(1985-09-07\u00a0\u2013 1986-12-13) |\n| *The Clone Wars* | 7 | 133 | October\u00a03,\u00a02008\u00a0\u2013 May\u00a04,\u00a02020\u00a0(2008-10-03\u00a0\u2013 2020-05-04) | Cartoon Network / Netflix / Disney+ |\n| *Rebels* | 4 | 75 | October\u00a03,\u00a02014\u00a0\u2013 March\u00a05,\u00a02018\u00a0(2014-10-03\u00a0\u2013 2018-03-05) | Disney XD |\n| *Resistance* | 2 | 40 | October\u00a07,\u00a02018\u00a0\u2013 January\u00a026,\u00a02020\u00a0(2018-10-07\u00a0\u2013 2020-01-26) | Disney Channel |\n| *The Bad Batch* | 2 | 47 | May\u00a04,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2021-05-04\u00a0\u2013 present) | Disney+ |\n| *Visions* | 2 | 18 | September\u00a022,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2021-09-22\u00a0\u2013 present) |\n| *Tales of the Jedi* | 1 | TBA | October\u00a026,\u00a02022\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2022-10-26\u00a0\u2013 present) |\n| *Young Jedi Adventures* | 1 | 25 | May\u00a04,\u00a02023\u00a0\u2013 present\u00a0(2023-05-04\u00a0\u2013 present) | Disney+ / Disney Junior |\n| **Animated micro-series and shorts** |\n| *Clone Wars* | 3 | 25 | November\u00a07,\u00a02003\u00a0\u2013 March\u00a025,\u00a02005\u00a0(2003-11-07\u00a0\u2013 2005-03-25) | Cartoon Network |\n| *Blips* | 1 | 8 | May\u00a03\u00a0\u2013 September\u00a04,\u00a02017\u00a0(2017-05-03\u00a0\u2013 2017-09-04) | YouTube |\n| *Forces of Destiny* | 2 | 32 | July\u00a03,\u00a02017\u00a0\u2013 May\u00a025,\u00a02018\u00a0(2017-07-03\u00a0\u2013 2018-05-25) |\n| *Galaxy of Adventures* | 2 | 55 | November\u00a030,\u00a02018\u00a0\u2013 October\u00a02,\u00a02020\u00a0(2018-11-30\u00a0\u2013 2020-10-02) |\n| *Roll Out* | 1 | 16 | August\u00a09,\u00a02019\u00a0\u2013 April\u00a01,\u00a02020\u00a0(2019-08-09\u00a0\u2013 2020-04-01) |\n| *Galaxy of Creatures* | 2 | 24 | October\u00a014,\u00a02021\u00a0\u2013 February\u00a021,\u00a02023\u00a0(2021-10-14\u00a0\u2013 2023-02-21) | StarWarsKids.com |\n| *Galactic Pals* | 1 | 12 | April\u00a012\u00a0\u2013 November\u00a01,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-04-12\u00a0\u2013 2022-11-01) |\n| \"Zen \u2013 Grogu and Dust Bunnies\" | Short | 1 | November\u00a012,\u00a02022\u00a0(2022-11-12) | Disney+ |\n\n### Films and specials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Teleplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Network\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Star Wars Holiday Special* | November\u00a017,\u00a01978\u00a0(1978-11-17) | Steve Binder | Pat Proft, Leonard Ripps, Bruce Vilanch, Rod Warren, and Mitzie Welch\n | Joe Layton, Jeff Starsh, Ken Welch, and Mitzie Welch\n | CBS |\n| *The Ewok Adventure* | November\u00a025,\u00a01984\u00a0(1984-11-25) | John Korty | Bob Carrau\n | George Lucas | Thomas G.

A schism within the Jedi leads to the creation of the Sith.[126]\n* The High Republic: Under the protection of the Jedi, the Republic grows into a golden age. This era includes *The High Republic* literary works and the animated series *Young Jedi Adventures*.[126]\n* Fall of the Jedi: The Republic's Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine (secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious), orchestrates the Clone Wars, overthrows the Republic, exterminates the Jedi Order and corrupts Anakin Skywalker.[126][130] This era includes the prequel trilogy films, the beginning of the episodic Skywalker saga, and the animated series *Tales of the Jedi* and *The Clone Wars*.[126]\n* Reign of the Empire: Palpatine's Galactic Empire rules the galaxy and the remaining Jedi are hunted down.[126] This era includes *Solo: A Star Wars Story*, *Obi-Wan Kenobi*, *Andor*, *Rogue One*, the animated series *The Bad Batch* and *Rebels*, and the video games *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor* and *Vader Immortal*.[126]\n* Age of Rebellion: The Rebellion against the Empire spreads across the galaxy, while the Jedi return with the emergence of Luke Skywalker.[126][131] This era includes the original trilogy films[f] and the video games *Star Wars Battlefront II* and *Star Wars: Squadrons*.[126]\n* The New Republic: Following the Empire's defeat, the emergent New Republic attempts to reunite the galaxy, while threatened by the remnants of the Empire.[126] This era includes *The Mandalorian*, *The Book of Boba Fett*, and *Ahsoka*.[126]\n* Rise of the First Order: The remnants of the Empire transform into the First Order but are fought by the Resistance, climaxing with the defeat of Palpatine and the Sith by the Jedi Rey.[126][130] This era includes the sequel trilogy films, the animated series *Star Wars Resistance* and the video game *Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge*.[126]\n* New Jedi Order: Rey builds a new Jedi Order, which will be depicted in an upcoming untitled film.[94][126]\n\n\nThe Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as *Legends* on April 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, *The Clone Wars* film, and television series.[2]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars in other media\n\nFrom 1976 to 2014, the term *Expanded Universe* (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed *Star Wars* storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.[133] Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production. Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the *Star Wars Legends* label,[133] with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game *The Old Republic* the only *Legends* material to still be produced. The *Star Wars* canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film *The Clone Wars* (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.[2] Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement.\n\n\n\n### Print media[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars* in print predates the release of the first film, with the November 1976 novelization of *Star Wars*, initially subtitled \"*From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker*\". Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.[134] The first \"Expanded Universe\" story appeared in Marvel Comics' *Star Wars* #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* the following month.\n\n\n\n#### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Star Wars books\n\n![](image)Timothy Zahn authored the *Thrawn* trilogy, which was widely credited with revitalizing the dormant *Star Wars* franchise in the early 1990s.\nAfter penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* (1978). The novelizations of *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) by Donald F. Glut and *Return of the Jedi* (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as *The Han Solo Adventures* trilogy (1979\u20131980) by Brian Daley,[135] and *The Adventures of Lando Calrissian* trilogy (1983) by L. Neil Smith.[136][137]\n\n\nTimothy Zahn's bestselling *Thrawn* trilogy (1991\u20131993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon.[138][139][140][141] The first novel, *Heir to the Empire*, reached #1 on the *New York Times* Best Seller list,[142] and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius Thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire.[143] In *The Courtship of Princess Leia* (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the *Thrawn* trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately marry.[144][145] Steve Perry's *Shadows of the Empire* (1996), set between *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi*, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.[146][147] The novel introduced the crime lord Prince Xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other works.[146][148] Other notable series from Bantam include the *Jedi Academy* trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson,[149][150] the 14-book *Young Jedi Knights* series (1995\u20131998) by Anderson and Rebecca Moesta,[150][151] and the *X-wing* series (1996\u20132012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.[152][153][154]\n\n\nDel Rey took over *Star Wars* book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called *The New Jedi Order* (1999\u20132003). Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.[155][156] The bestselling multi-author series *Legacy of the Force* (2006\u20132008) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia's son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith. Although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in *The Force Awakens* with Han and Leia's son Ben Solo, who becomes the evil Kylo Ren.[157][158][159][160]\n\n\nThree series set in the prequel era were published by Scholastic for younger audiences: the 18-book *Jedi Apprentice* (1999\u20132002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before *The Phantom Menace*; the 11-book *Jedi Quest* (2001\u20132004) follows Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker in between *The Phantom Menace* and *Attack of the Clones*; and the 10-book *The Last of the Jedi* (2005\u20132008), set almost immediately after *Revenge of the Sith*, features Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi. In 2019, a new prequel era novel, starring Qui-Gon and the young Obi-Wan, was published by Del Rey under the title *Star Wars: Master and Apprentice*.[161]\n\n\nAlthough Thrawn had been designated a *Legends* character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the canon in 2016 for the third season of the *Rebels* animated series, with Zahn returning to write more novels based on the character and set in the new canon.[162][163]\n\n\n\n#### Comics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Star Wars comics and List of Star Wars comic books\n\nMarvel Comics published a *Star Wars* comic book series from 1977 to 1986.[164][165][166][167] Original *Star Wars* comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine *Pizzazz* between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first original *Star Wars* stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the *Star Wars* comic series.[168] From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series *Ewoks* and *Droids* inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.[169][170][171] According to Marvel comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of *Star Wars* comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.[172] Marvel's *Star Wars* series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.[173] The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.[174]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new *Star Wars* comic it had in development, which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and published as the popular *Dark Empire* series (1991\u20131995).[175] Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including *Tales of the Jedi* (1993\u20131998), *X-wing Rogue Squadron* (1995\u20131998), *Star Wars: Republic* (1998\u20132006), *Star Wars Tales* (1999\u20132005), *Star Wars: Empire* (2002\u20132006), and *Knights of the Old Republic* (2006\u20132010).[176][177]\n\n\nAfter Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the *Star Wars* comics license would return to Marvel Comics,[178] whose parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009.[179] Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled *Star Wars*, *Darth Vader*, and the limited series *Princess Leia*.[180][181][182]\n\n\nFirst announced as *Project Luminous* at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, the *Star Wars: The High Republic* publishing initiative were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the then current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga was explored in various books and comics. Including ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older respectively.[183]\n\n\n\n### Audio[edit]\n\n\n#### Soundtracks and singles[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music of Star Wars\n\nJohn Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films; he has stated that he will retire from the franchise with *The Rise of Skywalker*.[184] He also composed Han Solo's theme for *Solo: A Star Wars Story*; John Powell adapted and composed the rest of the score.[185] Michael Giacchino composed the score of *Rogue One*.[185] Ludwig G\u00f6ransson scored and composed the music of *The Mandalorian*.[186] Williams also created the main theme for *Galaxy's Edge*.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Audio novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Story of Star Wars and List of Star Wars books\n\nThe first *Star Wars* audio work is *The Story of Star Wars*, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.[188]\n\n\n\n#### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars (radio)\n\nRadio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the *Star Wars* radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1. The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects.[189][190]\n\n\nThe first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes.[191][189][190] Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their film roles.[191][189]\n\n\nThe overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of *The Empire Strikes Back* debuted in 1983.[192] Billy Dee Williams joined the other two stars, reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute *Star Wars* audio drama titled *Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell*, written by Daley.[190][193] In the 1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several *Star Wars* series from Dark Horse Comics into audio dramas: the three-part *Dark Empire* saga, *Tales of the Jedi*, *Dark Lords of the Sith*, the *Dark Forces* trilogy, and *Crimson Empire* (1998).[193] *Return of the Jedi* was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring Daniels.[189][193]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars video games and List of Star Wars video games\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise has spawned over one hundred[194] computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as *Star Wars Legends* and removed from the canon in 2014). *Star Wars* games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n#### Early licensed games (1979\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nThe first officially licensed electronic *Star Wars* game was Kenner's 1979 table-top *Star Wars Electronic Battle Command*.[195][196] In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first *Star Wars* video game for the Atari 2600, *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back*,[197] followed soon the year later by *Star Wars: Jedi Arena*, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game *Star Wars*, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.[198] The next game, *Star Wars: Return of the Jedi* (1984), has more traditional raster graphics,[199] while the following *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1985) has vector graphics.[200]\n\n\nPlatform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive *Star Wars* (1987), an international *Star Wars* (1991), and *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1992). *Super Star Wars* (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years.\n\n\n\n#### LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LucasArts\n\nLucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes. In 1993, LucasArts released *Star Wars: X-Wing*, the first self-published *Star Wars* video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise.[201] It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games.[201] The *Rogue Squadron* series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.\n\n\n*Dark Forces* (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy,[202] was the first *Star Wars* first-person shooter.[203] It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, the Jedi.[203][202][204][205] The game was well received,[206][207][208] and it was followed by four sequels.[209][210] The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.[211] Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi,[203][212][213] a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films.[157] A massively multiplayer online role-playing game, *Star Wars Galaxies*, was in operation from 2003 until 2011. After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.[214]\n\n\n\n#### *EA Star Wars* (2014\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the *Star Wars* filmmakers. Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game *Jedi Challenges*, released in November 2017.[215][216] In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play *Star Wars* mobile games.[217] The *Battlefront* games received a canonical reboot with *Star Wars: Battlefront* in November 2015, which was followed by a sequel, *Battlefront II*, in November 2017. A single-player action-adventure game, *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, with an original story and cast of characters, was released in November 2019. A space combat game titled *Star Wars: Squadrons*, which builds upon the space battles from *Battlefront*, was released in October 2020.\n\n\n\n### Theme park attractions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars theme parks attractions\n\nIn addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the traveling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time *A Galactic Spectacular*. An immersive themed area called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019.[218] A themed hotel, *Star Wars*: Galactic Starcruiser, operated from 2022 to 2023 at Walt Disney World.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6\u00a0billion in merchandising revenue.[223] By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20\u00a0billion in merchandising revenue.[224]\n\n\nKenner made the first *Star Wars* action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.[225] *Star Wars* was the first intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history.[226] Lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their *Star Wars* sets.[227] The Lego *Star Wars* video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.[228][229]\n\n\nIn 1977, the board game *Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star* was released.[230][g] A *Star Wars Monopoly* and themed versions of *Trivial Pursuit* and Battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years. The board game *Risk* has been adapted in two editions by Hasbro: *The Clone Wars Edition* (2005)[232] and the *Original Trilogy Edition* (2006).[233] Three *Star Wars* tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.\n\n\n*Star Wars* Trading Cards have been published since the first \"blue\" series, by Topps, in 1977.[234] Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Each card series are of film stills or original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare \"promos\", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II \"floating Yoda\" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most \"base\" or \"common card\" sets are plentiful, many \"insert\" or \"chase cards\" are very rare.[235] From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and produced the *Star Wars Customizable Card Game*.\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\n*Star Wars* features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as \"the shadow\".[236]\nThere are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil.[237] Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the \"Chosen One\", a messianic individual. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until *Return of the Jedi*. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is \"doing what he thinks is right\".[238] George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.[239]\n\n\nThe saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[237] Each character\u2014primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey\u2014follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.[240] A defining step of the journey is \"Atonement with the Father\".[241] Obi-Wan's loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin,[242] whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.[243] Luke's discovery that Vader is his father has strong repercussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema.[244] Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father, Han Solo.[238] Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side.[245] According to *Inverse*, the final scene in *The Last Jedi*, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force, symbolizes that \"the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings.\"[246]\n\n\n\n### Historical influences[edit]\n\n\nPolitical science has been an important element of *Star Wars* since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War.[247][248] Darth Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet.[249][250] Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the *Schutzstaffel* served Adolf Hitler; this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader.[251] Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German \"shock\" troopers. Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II,[252] and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps. World War\u00a0II terms were used for names in the films; *e.g.* the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).[253] Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in *The Empire Strikes Back* resemble tank interiors,[254] and space battles in the original film were based on World War\u00a0I and World War\u00a0II dogfights.[255]\n\n\nPalpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitler's role before appointing himself *F\u00fchrer*.[252] Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and politicians like Richard Nixon.[256][257][h] The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives.[259] The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.[260][261]\n\n\nOn the inspiration for the First Order formed \"from the ashes of the Empire\", *The Force Awakens* director J.\u00a0J. Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and \"started working together again.\"[262]\n\n\n\n* ![The aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.](image)\n\nThe aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.\n* ![The flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.](image)\n\nThe flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe lightsaber and the blaster are iconic elements of the franchise.\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[263] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.[264] Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon.[265] The first *Star Wars* film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[266] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[267] The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.[268] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including *Hardware Wars*, *Spaceballs*, *The Family Guy Trilogy* and *Robot Chicken: Star Wars*.\n\n\nIn 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original *Star Wars* film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[269] *The Empire Strikes Back* was selected in 2010,[270][271] and *Return of the Jedi* was selected in 2021.[272] 35\u00a0mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,[273][274] but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.[275]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37\u00a0million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79\u00a0million.[255] The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.[276] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, *Star Wars* is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[277][278]\n\n\n*Star Wars* fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before *Star Wars*, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.[279] The commercial success of *Star Wars* created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[276] Along with *Jaws*, *Star Wars* started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[280][267] It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.[266]\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book *The Great Movies*, \"Like *The Birth of a Nation* and *Citizen Kane*, *Star Wars* was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.\" It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.[281] Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's *Jaws*, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.[255][282][283]\n\n\nSome critics have blamed *Star Wars* and *Jaws* for \"ruining\" Hollywood by shifting its focus from \"sophisticated\" films such as *The Godfather*, *Taxi Driver*, and *Annie Hall* to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.[284] One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, \"When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.\"[284][285] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through *Star Wars* and *Jaws*, Lucas and Spielberg \"didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect\", which was \"a kind of rebirth\".[283]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[286] Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by *Star Wars*, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter,[287] David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith,[281] and later *Star Wars* directors J.\u00a0J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.[288] Lucas's concept of a \"used universe\" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's *Blade Runner* (1982) and *Alien* (1979), James Cameron's *Aliens* (1986) as well as *The Terminator* (1984), George Miller's *Mad Max 2* (1981), and Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001\u20132003).[281] Christopher Nolan cited *Star Wars* as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film *Inception*.[289]\n\n\n\n#### Fan works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars fan films\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the *Star Wars* galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official *Star Wars* Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the *Star Wars* universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[290] Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.[291]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.[292] Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.[293] Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S. have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.[294][295]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Speculative fiction portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![icon](image)Science fiction portal\n\n\n* 501st Legion\n* Architecture of *Star Wars*\n* Comparison of Star Trek and Star Wars\n* Jedi census phenomenon\n* Jediism\n* List of space science fiction franchises\n* List of *Star Wars* characters\n* List of *Star Wars* creatures\n* List of *Star Wars* planets and moons\n* Music of *Star Wars*\n* Physics and *Star Wars*\n* Star Wars Celebration\n* *Star Wars* Day\n* *Star Wars* documentaries\n* *Star Wars: The High Republic*\n* Space warfare in fiction\n* The Force\n* *The Story of Star Wars*\n* Technology in *Star Wars*\n* Wookieepedia, the Star Wars wiki\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The film's release was preceded by its novelization in November 1976.\n2. **^** Most existing spin-off media was made non-canon and rebranded as 'Legends' in April 2014.[2]\n3. **^** Lucas started by researching the inspiration behind Alex Raymond's *Flash Gordon* comic, leading him to the works of author Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2014the *John Carter of Mars* series in particular.[50]\n4. **^** Played by Jake Lloyd as a child in *Episode I*\n5. **^** Each film was released two days later in the U.S.\n6. **^** The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in George Lucas's depiction of a \"used universe\".[132]\n7. **^** Not to be confused with the board game with the same name published in 1990[231]\n8. **^** In his early drafts, Lucas used the plot point of a dictator staying in power with the support of the military.

In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell\u2014it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves\u2014again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15\u00a0million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77\u201378% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8\u00a0million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799\u00a0billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2\u00a0billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640\u00a0million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2\u00a0billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5\u00a0billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120\u2013140\u00a0million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5\u00a0million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200\u2013250\u00a0million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260\u2013300\u00a0million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260\u2013270\u00a0million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300\u00a0million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1\u00a0million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100\u00a0million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5\u00a0million, including $60\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3\u00a0million), and Sunday ($90.4\u00a0million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314\u00a0million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9\u00a0million on Monday and $33.1\u00a0million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4\u00a0million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3\u00a0million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600\u00a0million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8\u00a0million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700\u00a0million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2\u00a0million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3\u00a0million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800\u00a0million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1\u00a0million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2\u00a0million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680\u00a0million over its first five days for a global debut of $850\u2013950\u00a0million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250\u2013280\u00a0million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5\u00a0million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2\u00a0million (RMB 189\u00a0million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1\u00a0million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300\u00a0million.[163] Overall, the film made $169\u00a0million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9\u00a0million), South Korea ($8.4\u00a0million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1\u00a0million), France ($6\u00a0million), and Italy ($5.8\u00a0million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866\u00a0million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5\u00a0million; RMB 2.22\u00a0billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($47.4\u00a0million), Mexico ($33.1\u00a0million), Australia ($30.8\u00a0million), Brazil ($26\u00a0million), Spain ($13.3\u00a0million), Japan ($13\u00a0million),[152] and Vietnam ($10\u00a0million).[180] It also made $21.6\u00a0million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($68.2\u00a0million), South Korea ($60.3\u00a0million), Mexico ($48.6\u00a0million), and India ($40.9\u00a0million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569\u00a0billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January\u00a02021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632\u00a0million), United Kingdom ($115\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million), Brazil ($86\u00a0million), and Mexico ($78\u00a0million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clich\u00e9d time travel plot \u2013 the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

The film was produced by David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures and directed by Victor Fleming. Set in the American South against the backdrop of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era, the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, following her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland), and her subsequent marriage to Rhett Butler (Clark Gable).\n\n\nThe film had a troubled production. The start of filming was delayed for two years until January 1939 because of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett, and concluded the following July. The role of Scarlett was difficult to cast, and 1,400 unknown women were interviewed for the part. Sidney Howard's original screenplay underwent many revisions by several writers to reduce it to a suitable length. The original director, George Cukor, was fired shortly after filming began, and was replaced by Fleming, who in turn was briefly replaced by Sam Wood while taking some time off due to exhaustion. Post-production concluded in November 1939, just a month before its premiere.\n\n\nIt received generally positive reviews upon its release on December 15, 1939. While the casting was widely praised, the long running time received criticism. At the 12th Academy Awards, *Gone with the Wind* received ten Academy Awards (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for Best Picture, Best Director (Fleming), Best Adapted Screenplay (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), Best Actress (Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.\n\n\n*Gone with the Wind* was immensely popular when first released. It became the highest-earning film made up to that point, and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When adjusted for monetary inflation, it is still the highest-grossing film in history. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. Although the film has been criticized as historical negationism, glorifying slavery and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth, it has been credited with triggering changes in the way in which African Americans were depicted cinematically. *Gone with the Wind* is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and in 1989 became one of the twenty-five inaugural films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1861, on the eve of the American Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara lives at Tara, her family's cotton plantation in Georgia, with her parents, two sisters, and their many black slaves. Scarlett is deeply attracted to Ashley Wilkes and learns he is to be married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton. At an engagement party the next day at Ashley's home, Twelve Oaks, a nearby plantation, Scarlett makes an advance on Ashley but is rebuffed; however, she catches the attention of another guest, Rhett Butler. The party is disrupted by news of President Lincoln's call for volunteers to fight the South, and the Southern men rush to enlist. Scarlett marries Melanie's younger brother Charles to arouse jealousy in Ashley before he leaves to fight. Following Charles's death while serving in the Confederate States Army, Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta. She creates a scene by attending a charity bazaar in mourning attire and waltzing with Rhett, now a blockade runner for the Confederacy.\n\n\nThe tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg. Many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Eight months later, as the Union Army besieges the city in the Atlanta campaign, Melanie gives birth with Scarlett's aid, and Rhett helps them flee the city. Rhett chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett to make her own way back to Tara. She finds Tara deserted, except for her father, sisters, and former slaves, Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of typhoid fever, and her father has lost his mind. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows to ensure her and her family's survival.\n\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy, the O'Haras toil in the cotton fields. Ashley returns but finds he is of little help to Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately but says he cannot leave Melanie. Scarlett's father attempts to chase away a carpetbagger from his land but is thrown from his horse and killed. Unable to pay the Reconstructionist taxes imposed on Tara, Scarlett unsuccessfully appeals to Rhett, then dupes her younger sister Suellen's fianc\u00e9, the middle-aged and wealthy general store owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her. Frank, Ashley, Rhett, and several other accomplices make a night raid on a shanty town after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. Shortly after Frank's funeral, Rhett proposes to Scarlett, and she accepts.\n\n\nRhett and Scarlett have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett still pines for Ashley and, chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, refuses to have any more children or share a bed with Rhett. One day at Frank's mill, Ashley's sister, India, sees Scarlett and Ashley embracing. Harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett, India eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Melanie, however, stands by Scarlett. After returning home, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom.\n\n\nThe next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, England, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues, resulting in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a miscarriage. While recovering, tragedy strikes again when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony. Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was Rhett, and not Ashley that she truly loved all along, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but he rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog. A distraught Scarlett resolves to return home to Tara, vowing to one day win Rhett back.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nTara plantation\n* Thomas Mitchell as Gerald O'Hara\n* Barbara O'Neil as Ellen O'Hara (his wife)\n* Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara (daughter)\n* Evelyn Keyes as Suellen O'Hara (daughter)\n* Ann Rutherford as Carreen O'Hara (daughter)\n* George Reeves as Stuart Tarleton (credited as Brent Tarleton)[nb 2]\n* Fred Crane as Brent Tarleton (credited as Stuart Tarleton)[nb 2]\n* Hattie McDaniel as Mammy (house servant)[nb 3]\n* Oscar Polk as Pork (house servant)[nb 3]\n* Butterfly McQueen as Prissy (house servant)[nb 3]\n* Victor Jory as Jonas Wilkerson (field overseer)\n* Everett Brown as Big Sam (field foreman)\n\n\nAt Twelve Oaks\n* Howard Hickman as John Wilkes\n* Alicia Rhett as India Wilkes (his daughter)\n* Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes (his son)\n* Olivia de Havilland as Melanie Hamilton (their cousin)\n* Rand Brooks as Charles Hamilton (Melanie's brother)\n* Carroll Nye as Frank Kennedy (a guest)\n* Clark Gable as Rhett Butler (a visitor from Charleston)\n\n\nIn Atlanta\n* Laura Hope Crews as Aunt Pittypat Hamilton\n* Eddie Anderson as Uncle Peter (her coachman)\n* Harry Davenport as Dr. Meade\n* Leona Roberts as Mrs. Meade\n* Jane Darwell as Mrs. Merriwether\n* Ona Munson as Belle Watling\n\n\nMinor supporting roles\n* Paul Hurst as the Yankee deserter\n* Cammie King as Bonnie Blue Butler\n* J.

Mayer and Irving Thalberg at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Pandro Berman at RKO Radio Pictures, and David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures. Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros. considered purchasing the rights after reading the synopsis but his biggest star Bette Davis was not interested at the time, and Darryl Zanuck of 20th Century-Fox had not offered enough money. However, Selznick changed his mind after his story editor Kay Brown and business partner John Hay Whitney urged him to buy the film rights. In July 1936\u2014a month after it was published\u2014Selznick bought the rights for $50,000.[3][4][5]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Publicity photo of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh as Rhett and Scarlett\nThe casting of the two lead roles became a complex, two-year endeavor. For the role of Rhett Butler, Selznick from the start wanted Clark Gable, but Gable was under contract to MGM, which never loaned him to other studios.[3] Gary Cooper was considered, but Samuel Goldwyn\u2014to whom Cooper was under contract\u2014refused to loan him out.[6] Warner offered a package of Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland for lead roles in return for the distribution rights.[7] By this time, Selznick was determined to get Gable and in August 1938 he eventually struck a deal with his father-in-law, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer: MGM would provide Gable and $1,250,000 for half of the film's budget, and in return, Selznick would have to pay Gable's weekly salary; half the profits would go to MGM while Loew's, Inc\u2014MGM's parent company\u2014would release the film.[3][6]\n\n\nThe arrangement to release through MGM meant delaying the start of production until the end of 1938, when Selznick's distribution deal with United Artists concluded.[6] Selznick used the delay to continue to revise the script and, more importantly, build publicity for the film through their endeavors to cast the role of Scarlett. Selznick began a nationwide casting call that interviewed 1,400 unknowns. The effort cost $100,000 and proved useless for the main objective of casting the role, but created \"priceless\" publicity.[3] Early frontrunners included Miriam Hopkins and Tallulah Bankhead, who were regarded as possibilities by Selznick prior to the purchase of the film rights; Joan Crawford, who was signed to MGM, was also considered as a potential pairing with Gable. After a deal was struck with MGM, Selznick held discussions with Norma Shearer\u2014who was MGM's top female star at the time\u2014but she withdrew herself from consideration after negative feedback from movie fans. Katharine Hepburn lobbied hard for the role with the support of her friend, George Cukor, who had been hired to direct, but she was vetoed by Selznick who felt she was not right for the part.[6][7][8]\n\n\nMany actresses, both known and unknown, were considered, but only thirty, in addition to the eventual choice, Vivien Leigh, were actually tested for the role, including Ardis Ankerson (Brenda Marshall), Jean Arthur, Tallulah Bankhead, Diana Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Nancy Coleman, Frances Dee, Terry Ray (Ellen Drew), Paulette Goddard, Edythe Marrenner (Susan Hayward), Anita Louise, Haila Stoddard, Margaret Tallichet, Lana Turner, and Linda Watkins.[9] Although Margaret Mitchell refused to publicly name her choice, the actress who came closest to winning her approval was Miriam Hopkins, whom Mitchell felt was just the right type of actress to play Scarlett as written in the book. However, Hopkins was in her mid-thirties at the time and was considered too old for the part.[6][7][8] Four actresses, including Jean Arthur and Joan Bennett, were still under consideration by December 1938; however, only two finalists, Paulette Goddard and Vivien Leigh, were tested in Technicolor, both on December 20.[10] Goddard almost won the role, but controversy over her marriage to Charlie Chaplin caused Selznick to change his mind.[3]\n\n\nSelznick had been quietly considering Vivien Leigh, a young English actress who was still little known in America, for the role of Scarlett since February 1938 when Selznick saw her in *Fire Over England* and *A Yank at Oxford*. Leigh's American agent was the London representative of the Myron Selznick talent agency (headed by David Selznick's brother, one of the owners of Selznick International), and she had requested in February that her name be submitted for consideration as Scarlett. By the summer of 1938 the Selznicks were negotiating with Alexander Korda, to whom Leigh was under contract, for her services later that year.[11] Selznick's brother arranged for them to meet for the first time on the night of December 10, 1938, when the burning of Atlanta was filmed. In a letter to his wife two days later, Selznick admitted that Leigh was \"the Scarlett dark horse\", and after a series of screen tests, her casting was announced on January 13, 1939.[12] Just before the shooting of the film, Selznick informed newspaper columnist Ed Sullivan: \"Scarlett O'Hara's parents were French and Irish. Identically, Miss Leigh's parents are French and Irish.\"[13]\n\n\nA pressing issue for Selznick throughout casting was Hollywood's persistent failure to accurately portray Southern accents. The studio believed that if the accent was not accurately depicted it could prove detrimental to the film's success. Selznick hired Susan Myrick (an expert on Southern speech, manners and customs recommended to him by Mitchell) and Will A. Price to coach the actors on speaking with a Southern drawl. Mitchell was complimentary about the vocal work of the cast, noting the lack of criticism when the film came out.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Screenplay[edit]\n\n\nOf the original screenplay writer, Sidney Howard, film historian Joanne Yeck writes, \"reducing the intricacies of *Gone with the Wind*'s epic dimensions was a herculean task ... and Howard's first submission was far too long, and would have required at least six hours of film; ... [producer] Selznick wanted Howard to remain on the set to make revisions ... but Howard refused to leave New England [and] as a result, revisions were handled by a host of local writers\".[16] Selznick dismissed director George Cukor three weeks into filming and sought out Victor Fleming, who was directing *The Wizard of Oz* at the time. Fleming was dissatisfied with the script, so Selznick brought in the screenwriter Ben Hecht to rewrite the entire screenplay within five days. Hecht returned to Howard's original draft and by the end of the week had succeeded in revising the entire first half of the script. Selznick undertook rewriting the second half himself but fell behind schedule, so Howard returned to work on the script for one week, reworking several key scenes in part two.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)David O. Selznick in 1940\n\"By the time of the film's release in 1939, there was some question as to who should receive screen credit\", writes Yeck. \"But despite the number of writers and changes, the final script was remarkably close to Howard's version. The fact that Howard's name alone appears on the credits may have been as much a gesture to his memory as to his writing, for in 1939 Sidney Howard died at age 48 in a farm-tractor accident, and before the movie's premiere.\"[16] Selznick, in a memo written in October 1939, discussed the film's writing credits: \"[Y]ou can say frankly that of the comparatively small amount of material in the picture which is not from the book, most is my own personally, and the only original lines of dialog which are not my own are a few from Sidney Howard and a few from Ben Hecht and a couple more from John Van Druten. Offhand I doubt that there are ten original words of [Oliver] Garrett's in the whole script. As to construction, this is about eighty per cent my own, and the rest divided between Jo Swerling and Sidney Howard, with Hecht having contributed materially to the construction of one sequence.\"[18]\n\n\nAccording to Hecht's biographer William MacAdams, \"At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and director Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to inform him he was on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately and go to work on *Gone with the Wind*, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht was in the middle of working on the film *At the Circus* for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick and director Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They acted scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, \"After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic.\"\n\n\nMacAdams writes, \"It is impossible to determine exactly how much Hecht scripted ... In the official credits filed with the Screen Writers Guild, Sidney Howard was of course awarded the sole screen credit, but four other writers were appended ... Jo Swerling for contributing to the treatment, Oliver H. P. Garrett and Barbara Keon to screenplay construction, and Hecht, to dialogue ...\"[19]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nThe \"burning\" of Atlanta from the 1961 re-release film trailer\nPrincipal photography began January 26, 1939, and ended on July 1, with post-production work continuing until November 11, 1939. Director George Cukor, with whom Selznick had a long working relationship and who had spent almost two years in pre-production on *Gone with the Wind*, was replaced after less than three weeks of shooting.[7][nb 4] Selznick and Cukor had already disagreed over the pace of filming and the script,[7][20] but other explanations put Cukor's departure down to Gable's discomfort at working with him. Emanuel Levy, Cukor's biographer, claimed that Gable had worked Hollywood's gay circuit as a hustler and that Cukor knew of his past, so Gable used his influence to have him discharged.[22] Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland learned of Cukor's firing on the day the Atlanta bazaar scene was filmed, and the pair went to Selznick's office in full costume and implored him to change his mind. Victor Fleming, who was directing *The Wizard of Oz*, was called in from MGM to complete the film, although Cukor continued privately to coach Leigh and De Havilland.[17] Another MGM director, Sam Wood, worked for two weeks in May when Fleming temporarily left the production due to exhaustion. Although some of Cukor's scenes were later reshot, Selznick estimated that \"three solid reels\" of his work remained in the final cut. As of the end of principal photography, Cukor had undertaken eighteen days of filming, Fleming ninety-three, and Wood twenty-four.[7]\n\n\nCinematographer Lee Garmes began the production, but on March 11, 1939\u2014after a month of shooting footage that Selznick and his associates regarded as \"too dark\"\u2014was replaced with Ernest Haller, working with Technicolor cinematographer Ray Rennahan. Garmes completed the first third of the film\u2014mostly everything prior to Melanie having the baby\u2014but did not receive a credit.[23]\n\n\nMost of the filming was done on \"the back forty\" of Selznick International with all the location scenes being photographed in California, mostly in Los Angeles County or neighboring Ventura County.[24] Tara, the fictional Southern plantation house, existed only as a plywood and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 facade built on the Selznick studio lot.[25] For the burning of Atlanta, new false facades were built in front of the Selznick backlot's many old abandoned sets, and Selznick himself operated the controls for the explosives that burned them down.[3] Sources at the time put the estimated production costs at $3.85\u00a0million, making it the second most expensive film made up to that point, with only *Ben-Hur* (1925) having cost more.[26][nb 5]\n\n\nAlthough legend persists that the Hays Office fined Selznick $5,000 for using the word \"damn\" in Butler's exit line, in fact the Motion Picture Association board passed an amendment to the Production Code on November 1, 1939, that forbade use of the words \"hell\" or \"damn\" except when their use \"shall be essential and required for portrayal, in proper historical context, of any scene or dialogue based upon historical fact or folklore ... or a quotation from a literary work, provided that no such use shall be permitted which is intrinsically objectionable or offends good taste\". With that amendment, the Production Code Administration had no further objection to Rhett's closing line.[28]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n\"Tara's Theme\" from the film trailer\nTo compose the score, Selznick chose Max Steiner, with whom he had worked at RKO Pictures in the early 1930s. Warner Bros.\u2014who had contracted Steiner in 1936\u2014agreed to lend him to Selznick. Steiner spent twelve weeks working on the score, the longest period that he had ever spent writing one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it was also the longest that he had ever written. Five orchestrators were hired: Hugo Friedhofer, Maurice de Packh, Bernhard Kaun, Adolph Deutsch and Reginald Bassett.\n\n\nThe score is characterized by two love themes, one for Ashley and Melanie's sweet love and another that evokes Scarlett's passion for Ashley, though notably there is no Scarlett and Rhett love theme. Steiner drew considerably on folk and patriotic music, which included Stephen Foster tunes such as \"Louisiana Belle\", \"Dolly Day\", \"Ringo De Banjo\", \"Beautiful Dreamer\", \"Old Folks at Home\", and \"Katie Belle\", which formed the basis of Scarlett's theme; other tunes that feature prominently are: \"Marching through Georgia\" by Henry Clay Work, \"Dixie\", \"Garryowen\", and \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\". The theme that is most associated with the film today is the melody that accompanies Tara, the O'Hara plantation; in the early 1940s, \"Tara's Theme\" formed the musical basis of the song \"My Own True Love\" by Mack David. In all, there are ninety-nine separate pieces of music featured in the score.\n\n\nDue to the pressure of completing on time, Steiner received some assistance in composing from Friedhofer, Deutsch and Heinz Roemheld, and in addition, two short cues\u2014by Franz Waxman and William Axt\u2014were taken from scores in the MGM library.[29]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Preview, premiere, and initial release[edit]\n\n\nOn September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, Irene, investor John \"Jock\" Whitney, and film editor Hal Kern drove out to Riverside, California to preview the film at the Fox Theatre. The film was still a rough cut at this stage, missing completed titles and lacking special optical effects. It ran for four hours and twenty-five minutes; it was later cut to under four hours for its proper release. A double bill of *Hawaiian Nights* and *Beau Geste* was playing, but after the first feature it was announced that instead of the second bill, the theater would be screening a preview of an unnamed upcoming film; the audience were informed they could leave but would not be readmitted once the film had begun, nor would phone calls be allowed once the theater had been sealed. When the title appeared on the screen the audience cheered, and after it had ended the film received a standing ovation.[7][30] In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the film had even started \"was the greatest moment of [Selznick's] life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings\",[31] with Selznick describing the preview cards as \"probably the most amazing any picture has ever had\".[32] When Selznick was asked by the press in early September how he felt about the film, he said: \"At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. Sometimes I think it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied\".[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)The premiere of the film at Loew's Grand, Atlanta\nAbout 300,000 people came out in Atlanta for the film's premiere at the Loew's Grand Theatre on December 15, 1939. It was the climax of three days of festivities hosted by Mayor William B. Hartsfield, which included a parade of limousines featuring stars from the film, receptions, thousands of Confederate flags, and a costume ball. Eurith D. Rivers, the governor of Georgia, declared December 15 a state holiday. An estimated 300,000 Atlanta residents and visitors lined the streets for seven miles to view the procession of limousines that brought stars from the airport. Only Leslie Howard and Victor Fleming chose not to attend: Howard had returned to England due to the outbreak of World War II, and Fleming had fallen out with Selznick and declined to attend any of the premieres.[26][32] Hattie McDaniel was also absent, as she and the other black cast members were prevented from attending the premiere due to Georgia's Jim Crow laws, which kept them from sitting with their white colleagues. Upon learning that McDaniel had been barred from the premiere, Clark Gable threatened to boycott the event, but McDaniel persuaded him to attend.[33] President Jimmy Carter later recalled it as \"the biggest event to happen in the South in my lifetime\".[34] Premieres in New York and Los Angeles followed, the latter attended by some of the actresses who had been considered for the part of Scarlett, among them Paulette Goddard, Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford.[32]\n\n\nFrom December 1939 to July 1940, the film played only advance-ticket road show engagements at a limited number of theaters at prices upwards of $1\u2014more than double the price of a regular first-run feature\u2014with MGM collecting an unprecedented 70 percent of the box office receipts, as opposed to the typical 30\u201335 percent of the period. After reaching saturation as a roadshow, MGM revised its terms to a 50 percent cut and halved the prices, before it finally entered general release in 1941 at \"popular\" prices.[35] Including its distribution and advertising costs, total expenditure on the film was as high as $7\u00a0million.[32][36]\n\n\n\n### Later releases[edit]\n\n\n![Poster shows Rhett Butler carrying Scarlett O'Hara against a backdrop of the Burning of Atlanta](image)1967 re-release poster\nIn 1942, Selznick liquidated his company for tax reasons, and sold his share in *Gone with the Wind* to his business partner, John Whitney, for $500,000. In turn, Whitney sold it on to MGM for $2.8\u00a0million, so that the studio owned the film outright.[36] MGM immediately re-released the film in the spring of 1942,[17] and again in 1947 and 1954.[7] The 1954 reissue was the first time the film was shown in widescreen, compromising the original Academy ratio and cropping the top and bottom to an aspect ratio of 1.75:1. In doing so, a number of shots were optically re-framed and cut into the three-strip camera negatives, forever altering five shots in the film.[37]\n\n\nA 1961 release of the film commemorated the centennial anniversary of the start of the Civil War, and it also included a gala \"premiere\" at the Loew's Grand Theater. It was attended by Selznick and many other stars of the film, including Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland;[38] Clark Gable had died the previous year.[39] For its 1967 re-release, the film was blown up to 70mm,[7] and issued with updated poster artwork featuring Gable\u2014with his white shirt ripped, open\u2014holding Leigh against a backdrop of orange flames.[38] There were further re-releases in 1971, 1974 and 1989; for the fiftieth anniversary reissue in 1989, it was given a complete audio and video restoration. It was released in theaters one more time in the United States, in 1998 by Time Warner-owned New Line Cinema.[40][41]\n\n\nIn 2013, a 4K digital restoration was released in the United Kingdom to coincide with Vivien Leigh's centenary.[42] In 2014, special screenings were scheduled over a two-day period at theaters across the United States to coincide with the film's 75th anniversary.[43]\n\n\n\n### Television and home media[edit]\n\n\nThe film received its U.S. television premiere on the HBO cable network on June 11, 1976, and played on the channel for a total of fourteen times throughout the rest of the month.[44][17][45] Other cable channels also broadcast the film during June.[46] It made its network television debut in November of that year; NBC paid $5\u00a0million for a one-off airing, and it was broadcast in two parts on successive evenings.[17] It became at that time the highest-rated television program ever presented on a single network, watched by 47.5 percent of the households sampled in America, and 65 percent of television viewers, still the record for the highest-rated film to ever air on television.[17][41]\n\n\nIn 1978, CBS signed a deal worth $35\u00a0million to broadcast the film twenty times over as many years.[17] Turner Entertainment acquired the MGM film library in 1986, but the deal did not include the television rights to *Gone with the Wind*, which were still held by CBS. A deal was struck in which the rights were returned to Turner Entertainment and CBS's broadcast rights to *The Wizard of Oz* were extended.[17] The film was used to launch two cable channels owned by Turner Broadcasting System: Turner Network Television (1988) and Turner Classic Movies (1994).[47][48]\n\n\nThe film debuted on videocassette in March 1985, where it placed second in the sales charts,[17] and has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats.[38]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McDaniel, de Havilland, and Leigh were praised for their performances.\nUpon its release, consumer magazines and newspapers generally gave *Gone with the Wind* excellent reviews;[7] however, while its production values, technical achievements, and scale of ambition were universally recognized, some reviewers of the time found the film to be too long and dramatically unconvincing. Frank S. Nugent for *The New York Times* best summed up the general sentiment by acknowledging that while it was the most ambitious film production made up to that point, it probably was not the greatest film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be an \"interesting story beautifully told\".[49] Franz Hoellering of *The Nation* was of the same opinion: \"The result is a film which is a major event in the history of the industry but only a minor achievement in motion-picture art. There are moments when the two categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are filled with mere spectacular efficiency.\"[50]\n\n\nWhile the film was praised for its fidelity to the novel,[49] this aspect was also singled out as the main factor in contributing to the lengthy running time.[51] John C. Flinn wrote for *Variety* that Selznick had \"left too much in\", and that as entertainment, the film would have benefited if repetitious scenes and dialog from the latter part of the story had been trimmed.[51] *The Manchester Guardian* felt that the film's one serious drawback was that the story lacked the epic quality to justify the outlay of time and found the second half, which focuses on Scarlett's \"irrelevant marriages\" and \"domestic squabbles\", mostly superfluous, and the sole reason for their inclusion had been \"simply because Margaret Mitchell wrote it that way\". *The Guardian* believed that if \"the story had been cut short and tidied up at the point marked by the interval, and if the personal drama had been made subservient to a cinematic treatment of the central theme\u2014the collapse and devastation of the Old South\u2014then *Gone With the Wind* might have been a really great film\".[52] Likewise, Hoellering also found the second half of the film to be weaker than the first half: identifying the Civil War to be the driving force of the first part while the characters dominate in the second part, he concluded this is where the main fault of the film lay, commenting that \"the characters alone do not suffice\". Despite many excellent scenes, he considered the drama to be unconvincing and that the \"psychological development\" had been neglected.[50]\n\n\nMuch of the praise was reserved for the casting, with Vivien Leigh in particular being singled out for her performance as Scarlett. Nugent described her as the \"pivot of the picture\" and believed her to be \"so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable\".[49] Similarly, Hoellering found her \"perfect\" in \"appearance and movements\"; he felt her acting best when she was allowed to \"accentuate the split personality she portrays\" and thought she was particularly effective in such moments of characterization like the morning after the marital rape scene.[50] Flinn also found Leigh suited to the role physically and felt she was best in the scenes where she displays courage and determination, such as the escape from Atlanta and when Scarlett kills a Yankee deserter.[51] Leigh won in the Best Actress category for her performance at the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Awards.[53] Of Clark Gable's performance as Rhett Butler, Flinn felt the characterization was \"as close to Miss Mitchell's conception\u2014and the audience's\u2014as might be imagined\",[51] a view which Nugent concurred with,[49] although Hoellering felt that Gable did not quite convince in the closing scenes, as Rhett walks out on Scarlett in disgust.[50] Of the other principal cast members, both Hoellering and Flinn found Leslie Howard to be \"convincing\" as the weak-willed Ashley, with Flinn identifying Olivia de Havilland as a \"standout\" as Melanie;[50][51] Nugent was also especially taken with de Havilland's performance, describing it as a \"gracious, dignified, tender gem of characterization\".[49] Hattie McDaniel's performance as Mammy was singled out for praise by many critics: Nugent believed she gave the best performance in the film after Vivien Leigh,[49] with Flinn placing it third after Leigh's and Gable's performances.[51]\n\n\n\n### Academy Awards[edit]\n\n\nAt the 12th Academy Awards, *Gone with the Wind* set a record for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the competitive categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture).[54][55]\n\n\nThe film's record of eight competitive wins stood until *Gigi* (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by *Ben-Hur* (1959) which won eleven.[56] *Gone with the Wind* also held the record for most nominations until *All About Eve* (1950) secured fourteen.[8] It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold the record of the longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted.[57] The running time for *Gone with the Wind* is just under 221\u00a0minutes, while *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) runs for just over 222\u00a0minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, *Gone with the Wind* lasts for 234\u00a0minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238\u00a0minutes) while *Lawrence of Arabia* comes in slightly shorter at 232\u00a0minutes with its additional components.[58][59]\n\n\nHattie McDaniel became the first African-American to win an Academy Award\u2014beating out her co-star Olivia de Havilland, who was also nominated in the same category\u2014but was racially segregated from her co-stars at the awards ceremony at the Coconut Grove; she and her escort were made to sit at a separate table at the back of the room.[60] Meanwhile, screenwriter Sidney Howard became the first posthumous Oscar winner and Selznick personally received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his career achievements.[8][54]\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademy Awards and nominations\n| Award\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Outstanding Production | Selznick International Pictures | Won\n |\n| Best Director | Victor Fleming | Won\n |\n| Best Actor | Clark Gable | Nominated\n |\n| Best Actress | Vivien Leigh | Won\n |\n| Best Supporting Actress | Olivia de Havilland | Nominated\n |\n| Hattie McDaniel | Won\n |\n| Best Screenplay | Sidney Howard | Won\n |\n| Best Art Direction | Lyle Wheeler | Won\n |\n| Best Cinematography \u2013 Color | Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan | Won\n |\n| Best Film Editing | Hal C.

He went on to characterize it as a \"nostalgic plea for sympathy for a still-living cause of Southern reaction\". Moss further called out the stereotypical black characterizations, such as the \"shiftless and dull-witted Pork\", the \"indolent and thoroughly irresponsible Prissy\", Big Sam's \"radiant acceptance of slavery\", and Mammy with her \"constant haranguing and doting on every wish of Scarlett\".[62] Similarly, Melvin B. Tolson, a poet and educator, wrote \"*Birth of a Nation* was such a barefaced lie that a moron could see through it. *Gone with the Wind* is such a subtle lie that it will be swallowed as truth by millions of whites and blacks alike.\"[63]\n\n\nFollowing Hattie McDaniel's Oscar win, Walter Francis White, leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, accused her of being an Uncle Tom. McDaniel responded that she would \"rather make seven hundred dollars a week playing a maid than seven dollars being one\"; she further questioned White's qualification to speak on behalf of black people, since he was light-skinned and only one-eighth black.[60]\n\n\nOpinion in the black community was generally divided upon release, with the film being called by some a \"weapon of terror against black America\" and an insult to black audiences, and demonstrations were held in various cities.[60] Malcolm X later recalled that \"when Butterfly McQueen went into her act, I felt like crawling under the rug\".[64] Even so, some sections of the black community recognized McDaniel's achievements to be representative of progress: some African-Americans crossed picket lines and praised McDaniel's warm and witty characterization, and others hoped that the industry's recognition of her work would lead to increased visibility on screen for other black actors. In its editorial congratulation to McDaniel on winning her Academy Award, *Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life* used the film as a reminder of the \"limit\" put on black aspiration by old prejudices.[60][62]\n\n\n\n### Audience response[edit]\n\n\nUpon its release, *Gone with the Wind* broke attendance records everywhere. At the Capitol Theatre in New York alone, it averaged eleven thousand admissions per day in late December,[35] and within four years of its release had sold an estimated sixty million tickets across the United States\u2014sales equivalent to just under half the population at the time.[65][66] It repeated its success overseas, and was a sensational hit during the Blitz in London, opening in April 1940 and playing for four years.[67] By the time MGM withdrew it from circulation, at the end of 1943, its worldwide distribution had returned a gross rental (the studio's share of the box office gross) of $32\u00a0million, making it the most profitable film ever made up to that point.[8][17] It eventually opened in Japan in September 1952 and became the highest-grossing foreign film there.[68][69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Line up to see *Gone with the Wind* in Pensacola, Florida (1947)\nEven though it earned its investors roughly twice as much as the previous record-holder, *The Birth of a Nation*,[70][71] the box-office performances of the two films were likely much closer. The bulk of the earnings from *Gone with the Wind* came from its roadshow and first-run engagements, where the distributor received 70 percent and 50 percent of the box-office gross respectively, rather than its general release, which at the time typically saw the distributor's share set at 30\u201335 percent of the gross.[35] In the case of *The Birth of a Nation*, its distributor, Epoch, sold off many of its distribution territories on a \"states rights\" basis\u2014which typically amounted to 10 percent of the box-office gross\u2014and Epoch's accounts are only indicative of its own profits from the film, and not the local distributors. Carl E. Milliken, secretary of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, estimated that *The Birth of a Nation* had been seen by fifty million people by 1930.[72][73]\n\n\nWhen it was re-released in 1947, it earned a $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, and was one of the top ten releases of the year.[36][70] Successful re-releases in 1954 and 1961 enabled it to retain its position as the industry's top earner, despite strong challenges from more recent films such as *Ben-Hur*,[74] but it was finally overtaken by *The Sound of Music* in 1966.[75]\n\n\nThe 1967 reissue was unusual in that MGM opted to roadshow it, a decision that turned it into the most successful re-release in the history of the industry. It generated a box-office gross of $68\u00a0million, making it MGM's most lucrative film after *Doctor Zhivago* from the latter half of the decade.[76] MGM earned a rental of $41\u00a0million from the release,[77] with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30\u00a0million, placing it second only to *The Graduate* for that year.[70][77] Including its $6.7\u00a0million rental from the 1961 reissue,[78] it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North American market, with only *The Sound of Music*, *The Graduate* and *Doctor Zhivago* making more for their distributors.[70] A further re-release in 1971 allowed it to briefly recapture the record from *The Sound of Music*, bringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116\u00a0million by the end of 1971\u2014more than trebling its earnings from its initial release\u2014before losing the record again the following year to *The Godfather*.[41][79]\n\n\nAcross all releases, it is estimated that *Gone with the Wind* has sold over 200\u00a0million tickets in the United States and Canada,[65] generating more theater admissions in that territory than any other film.[80] The film was phenomenally successful in Western Europe too, generating approximately 35\u00a0million tickets in the United Kingdom and over 16\u00a0million in France, respectively becoming the biggest and sixth-biggest ticket-sellers in those markets.[81][82][83] The film's appeal has endured overseas, sustaining a popularity similar to its domestic longevity; in 1975 it played to capacity audiences every night during the first three weeks of its run at London's Plaza 2 Theatre, and in Japan it generated over half a million admissions at twenty theaters during a five-week engagement.[84] In total, *Gone with the Wind* has grossed over $390\u00a0million globally at the box office;[85] in 2007 Turner Entertainment estimated the gross to be equivalent to approximately $3.3\u00a0billion when adjusted for inflation to current prices;[8] *Guinness World Records* arrived at a figure of $3.44\u00a0billion in 2014 making it the most successful film in cinema history.[86]\n\n\nThe film remains immensely popular with audiences into the 21st century, having been voted the most popular film in two nationwide polls of Americans undertaken by Harris Interactive in 2008, and again in 2014. The market research firm surveyed over two thousand U.S. adults, with the results weighted by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income so their proportions matched the composition of the adult population.[87][88]\n\n\n\n### Critical re-evaluation[edit]\n\n\nAFI 100 Years... series\n\n\n> \n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies \u2013 #4\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions \u2013 #2\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains\n> \t+ Rhett Butler, Hero \u2013 Nominated\n> \t+ Scarlett O'Hara, Hero \u2013 Nominated\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:\n> \t+ \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" \u2013 #1\n> \t+ \"After all, tomorrow is another day!\" \u2013 #31\n> \t+ \"As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.\" \u2013 #59\n> \t+ \"Fiddle-dee-dee.\" \u2013 Nominated\n> \t+ \"I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies.\" \u2013 Nominated\n> * AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores \u2013 #2\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers \u2013 #43\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 #6\n> * AFI's 10 Top 10 \u2013 #4 Epic film\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAmerican Film Institute[89]\n\nWhen revisiting the film in the 1970s, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. believed that Hollywood films generally age well, revealing an unexpected depth or integrity, but in the case of *Gone with the Wind* time has not treated it kindly.[90] Richard Schickel argued that one measure of a film's quality is to ask what the viewer can remember of it, and the film falls down in this regard: unforgettable imagery and dialogue are simply not present.[91] Stanley Kauffmann, likewise, also found the film to be a largely forgettable experience, claiming he could only remember two scenes vividly.[92] Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being \"badly written\", in turn describing the dialogue as \"flowery\" and possessing a \"picture postcard\" sensibility.[90][91] Schickel also believes the film fails as popular art, in that it has limited rewatch value\u2014a sentiment that Kauffmann also concurs with, stating that having watched it twice he hopes \"never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs\".[91][92] Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being \"created\" or \"directed\", but rather having emerged \"steaming from the crowded kitchen\", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.[91][93]\n\n\nSarris concedes that despite its artistic failings, the film does hold a mandate around the world as the \"single most beloved entertainment ever produced\".[93] Judith Crist observes that, kitsch aside, the film is \"undoubtedly still the best and most durable piece of popular entertainment to have come off the Hollywood assembly lines\", the product of a showman with \"taste and intelligence\".[94] Schlesinger notes that the first half of the film does have a \"sweep and vigor\" that aspire to its epic theme, but agreed with criticisms of the personal lives taking over in the second half, and how it ends up losing its theme in unconvincing sentimentality.[90] Kauffmann also finds interesting parallels with *The Godfather*, which had just replaced *Gone with the Wind* as the highest-grosser at the time: both were produced from \"ultra-American\" best-selling novels, both live within codes of honor that are romanticized, and both in essence offer cultural fabrication or revisionism.[92]\n\n\nThe critical perception of the film has shifted in the intervening years, which resulted in it being ranked 235th in *Sight & Sound*'s prestigious decennial critics poll in 2012,[95] and in 2015 sixty-two international film critics polled by the BBC voted it the 97th best American film.[96]\n\n\n\n### Industry recognition[edit]\n\n\nThe film has featured in several high-profile industry polls. In 1977 it was voted the most popular film by the American Film Institute (AFI), in a poll of the organization's membership;[7] the AFI also ranked the film fourth on its \"100 Greatest Movies\" list in 1998,[97] with it slipping down to sixth place in the tenth anniversary edition in 2007.[98] Film directors ranked it 322nd in the 2012 edition of the decennial *Sight & Sound* poll,[95] and in 2016 it was selected as the ninth best \"directorial achievement\" in a Directors Guild of America members poll.[99] In 2014, it placed fifteenth in an extensive poll undertaken by *The Hollywood Reporter*, which balloted every studio, agency, publicity firm and production house in the Hollywood region.[100]\n\n\n*Gone with the Wind* was one of the twenty-five inaugural films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress in 1989 for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Analysis and controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Historical portrayal[edit]\n\n\n*Gone with the Wind* has been criticized as having perpetuated Civil War myths and black stereotypes.[103] David Reynolds wrote that \"The white women are elegant, their menfolk are noble or at least dashing. And, in the background, the black slaves are mostly dutiful and content, clearly incapable of an independent existence.\" Reynolds likened *Gone with the Wind* to *The Birth of a Nation* and other re-imaginings of the South during the era of segregation, in which white Southerners are portrayed as defending traditional values, and the issue of slavery is largely ignored.[64] The film has been described as a \"regression\" that promotes both the myth of the black rapist and the honorable and defensive role of the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction,[104] and as a \"social propaganda\" film offering a \"white supremacist\" view of the past.[103]\n\n\nFrom 1972 to 1996, the Atlanta Historical Society held a number of *Gone with the Wind* exhibits, among them a 1994 exhibit which was titled \"Disputed Territories: *Gone with the Wind* and Southern Myths\". One of the questions that was explored by the exhibit was \"How True to Life Were the Slaves in GWTW?\" This section showed that slave experiences were diverse and, as a result, it concluded that the \"happy darky\" was a myth, as was the belief that all slaves experienced violence and brutality.[105]\n\n\nW. Bryan Rommel Ruiz has argued that despite factual inaccuracies in its depiction of the Reconstruction period, *Gone with the Wind* reflects contemporary interpretations of it that were common in the early 20th century. One such viewpoint is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends off a leering freedman: a politician can be heard offering forty acres and a mule to the emancipated slaves in exchange for their votes. The inference is taken to mean that freedmen are ignorant about politics and unprepared for freedom, unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt Reconstruction officials. While perpetuating some Lost Cause myths, the film makes concessions with regard to others. After the attack on Scarlett in the shanty town, a group of men including Scarlett's husband Frank, Rhett Butler, and Ashley raid the town; in the novel they belong to the Ku Klux Klan, representing the common trope of protecting the white woman's virtue, but the filmmakers consciously neutralize the presence of the Klan in the film by simply referring to it as a \"political meeting\".[106]\n\n\nThomas Cripps reasons that in some respects, the film undercuts racial stereotypes;[107] in particular, the film created greater engagement between Hollywood and black audiences,[107] with dozens of films making small gestures in recognition of the emerging trend.[62] Only a few weeks after its initial run, a story editor at Warner wrote a memorandum to Walter Wanger about *Mississippi Belle*, a script that contained the worst excesses of plantation films, suggesting that *Gone with the Wind* had made the film \"unproducible\". More than any film since *The Birth of a Nation*, it unleashed a variety of social forces that foreshadowed an alliance of white liberals and black people who encouraged the expectation that black people would one day achieve equality. According to Cripps, the film eventually became a template for measuring social change.[62]\n\n\n\n### 21st-century reappraisal[edit]\n\n\nIn the 21st century, criticism of the film's depictions of race and slavery led to its availability being curtailed. In 2017, *Gone with the Wind* was pulled from the schedule at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, Tennessee, after a 34-year run of annual showings.[108][109] On June 9, 2020, the film was removed from HBO Max in response to an op-ed written by screenwriter John Ridley that was published in that day's edition of the *Los Angeles Times*, which called for the streaming service to temporarily remove the film from its content library. He wrote that \"it continues to give cover to those who falsely claim that clinging to the iconography of the plantation era is a matter of 'heritage, not hate'.\"[110][111][112] A spokesperson for HBO Max said that the film was \"a product of its time\" and as a result, it depicted \"ethnic and racial prejudices\" that \"were wrong then and are wrong today\". It was also announced that the film would return to the streaming service at a later date, although it would incorporate \"a discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those very depictions, but will be presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed. If we are to create a more just, equitable and inclusive future, we must first acknowledge and understand our history.\"[113]\n\n\nThe film's removal sparked a debate about political correctness going too far, with film critics and historians criticizing HBO as engaging in censorship.[114] Following its withdrawal, the film reached the top of Amazon's best-sellers sales chart for TV and films, and fifth place on Apple's iTunes Store film chart.[115] HBO Max returned the film to its service later that month, with a new introduction by Jacqueline Stewart.[116] Stewart described the film, in an op-ed for CNN, as \"a prime text for examining expressions of white supremacy in popular culture\", and said that \"it is precisely because of the ongoing, painful patterns of racial injustice and disregard for Black lives that *Gone with the Wind* should stay in circulation and remain available for viewing, analysis and discussion.\" She described the controversy as \"an opportunity to think about what classic films can teach us.\"[117]\n\n\nAt a political rally in February 2020, President Donald Trump criticized the 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, stating that *Gone with the Wind* and *Sunset Boulevard* (1950) were more deserving of the award for Best Picture than that year's winner, the South Korean film *Parasite*. His comments elicited commentary from critics and a backlash from pundits across the political spectrum on social media.[118]\n\n\n\n### Depiction of marital rape[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most notorious and widely condemned scenes in *Gone with the Wind* depicts what is now legally defined as \"marital rape\".[119][120] The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett at the bottom of the staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told \"no\" by the struggling Scarlett;[121][122] Rhett ignores her resistance, scolds her and carries her up the stairs to the bedroom,[121][122] where the audience is left in no doubt that she will \"get what's coming to her\".[123] The next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett glowing with barely suppressed sexual satisfaction;[121][122][123] Rhett apologizes for his behavior, blaming it on his drinking.[121] The scene has been accused of combining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each other,[121] and of reinforcing a notion about forced sex: that women secretly enjoy it, and it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.[123]\n\n\nFilm critic Molly Haskell has argued that, nevertheless, for women who are uncritical of the scene, it is by and large consistent with what they have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett to take the initiative and insist on having sexual intercourse.[124]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First Archivist of the United States R. D. W. Connor receiving the film *Gone with the Wind* from Senator Walter F. George of Georgia (on the left) and Loew's Eastern Division Manager Carter Barron, 1941\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n*Gone with the Wind* and its production have been explicitly referenced, satirized, dramatized and analyzed on numerous occasions across a range of media, from contemporaneous works such as *Second Fiddle*\u2014a 1939 film spoofing the \"search for Scarlett\"\u2014to current television shows, such as *The Simpsons*.[103][125][126] *The Scarlett O'Hara War* (a 1980 television dramatization of the casting of Scarlett),[127] *Moonlight and Magnolias* (a 2007 play by Ron Hutchinson that dramatizes Ben Hecht's five-day re-write of the script),[128] and \"Went with the Wind!\" (a sketch on *The Carol Burnett Show* that parodied the film in the aftermath of its television debut in 1976) are among the more noteworthy examples of its enduring presence in popular culture.[17] It was also the subject of a 1988 documentary, *The Making of a Legend: Gone with the Wind*, detailing the film's difficult production history.[129] In 1990, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp depicting Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh embracing in a scene from the film.[130] In 2003, Leigh and Gable (as Scarlett and Rhett) were ranked number 95 on VH1's list of the \"200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time\".[131]\n\n\n\n### Sequel[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the publication of her novel, Margaret Mitchell was inundated with requests for a sequel but she claimed not to have a notion of what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, and as a result, she had \"left them to their ultimate fate\". Until her death in 1949, Mitchell continued to resist pressure from Selznick and MGM to write a sequel. In 1975, her brother, Stephens Mitchell (who assumed control of her estate), authorized a sequel that would be jointly produced by MGM and Universal Studios on a budget of $12\u00a0million. Anne Edwards was commissioned to write the sequel as a novel which would then be adapted into a screenplay, and published in conjunction with the film's release. Edwards submitted a 775-page manuscript which was titled *Tara, The Continuation of Gone with the Wind*, set between 1872 and 1882 and focusing on Scarlett's divorce from Rhett; MGM was not satisfied with the story and the deal collapsed.[17]\n\n\nThe idea was revived in the 1990s, when a sequel was finally produced in 1994, in the form of a television miniseries. *Scarlett* was based on the novel by Alexandra Ripley, itself a sequel to Mitchell's book. British actors Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were cast as Scarlett and Rhett, and the series follows Scarlett's relocation to Ireland after she again becomes pregnant by Rhett.[132]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films featuring slavery\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Loews was the parent company of MGM.[2]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The credits at the start of the film contain an error: George Reeves is listed \"as Brent Tarleton\", but plays Stuart, while Fred Crane is listed \"as Stuart Tarleton\", but plays Brent.[1]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Hattie McDaniel, Oscar Polk and Butterfly McQueen play slaves in the film but are credited as \"house servants\". This misrepresentation is retained in the cast listing so that the credits are accurately conveyed to the reader.\n4. **^** From a private letter from journalist and on-set technical advisor Susan Myrick to Margaret Mitchell in February 1939: \n> George [Cukor] finally told me all about it. He hated [leaving the production] very much he said but he could not do otherwise. In effect he said he is an honest craftsman and he cannot do a job unless he knows it is a good job and he feels the present job is not right. For days, he told me he has looked at the rushes and felt he was failing... the thing did not click as it should. Gradually he became convinced that the script was the trouble... David [Selznick], himself, thinks HE is writing the script... And George has continually taken script from day to day, compared the [Oliver] Garrett-Selznick version with the [Sidney] Howard, groaned and tried to change some parts back to the Howard script. But he seldom could do much with the scene... So George just told David he would not work any longer if the script was not better and he wanted the Howard script back. David told George he was a director\u2014not an author and he (David) was the producer and the judge of what is a good script... George said he was a director and a damn good one and he would not let his name go out over a lousy picture... And bull-headed David said \"OK get out!\"[20]\n> \n> \n\n Selznick had already been unhappy with Cukor (\"a very expensive luxury\") for not being more receptive to directing other Selznick assignments, even though Cukor had remained on salary since early 1937. In a confidential memo written in September 1938, Selznick flirted with the idea of replacing him with Victor Fleming.[18] Louis B. Mayer had been trying to have Cukor replaced with an MGM director since negotiations between the two studios began in May 1938. In December 1938, Selznick wrote to his wife about a phone call he had with Mayer: \"During the same conversation, your father made another stab at getting George off of *Gone With the Wind*.\"[21]\n5. **^** *Time* also reports that *Hell's Angels* (1930)\u2014directed by Howard Hughes\u2014cost more, but this was later revealed to be incorrect; the accounts for *Hell's Angels* show it cost $2.8\u00a0million, but Hughes publicized it as costing $4\u00a0million, selling it to the media as the most expensive film ever made up to that point.[27]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Gone With the Wind\". *The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures*.

It is the first installment in the *Avatar* film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Avatar* began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film *Titanic*, for a planned release in 1999;[13] however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14] Work on the language of the Na'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[15][16] *Avatar* was officially budgeted at $237\u00a0million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.[4] Other estimates put the cost at between $280\u00a0million and $310\u00a0million for production and at $150\u00a0million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and \"4D\" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.[20]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions[26] and caused 3D films[27] to increase in popularity. Its success led to the *Avatar* franchise, which includes the sequels *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022), *Avatar 3* (2025), *Avatar 4* (2029), and *Avatar 5* (2031).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted and is suffering ecocide.[28] The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0\u00a0m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\n\n\nWhile escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife, and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\n\n\nJake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred Tree of Souls, Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\n\n\nThe Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fictional universe of Avatar\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSam Worthington (*left*) and Zoe Salda\u00f1a (*right*), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n* Sam Worthington as Corporal Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down.[29] Worthington, who was living in his car at the time,[30] auditioned twice early in development,[11][*failed verification*] and he has signed on for possible sequels.[31] Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character \"a quality that is really real\". Cameron said he \"has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world\".[32][*failed verification*] Cameron offered the role to Matt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment to the *Bourne* film series.[33]\n\t+ Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Tommy.\n* Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite, the daughter of the leaders of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naivet\u00e9 and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.[34] The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated.[35] Salda\u00f1a signed on for potential sequels.[36]\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for *Avatar*.[37] Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in *Aliens*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron[38] but was ultimately not cast.\n* Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chac\u00f3n, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in *Girlfight*.[37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation.[39][40][41] While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist[42] who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program.[43] He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar. Although he is expected to lead the diplomatic contact with the Na'vi, it turns out that Jake has the personality better suited to win the natives' respect.\n\t+ Moore also portrays Spellman's Na'vi avatar.\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader, Neytiri's mother, and consort to clan leader Eytukan.[44]\n* Wes Studi as Eytukan te Tskaha Kamun'itan, the Omaticaya's clan leader, Neytiri's father, and Mo'at's mate.\n* Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey te Rongola Atey'itan, the finest warrior of the Omaticaya. He is heir to the chieftainship of the tribe. At the beginning of the film's story, he is betrothed to Neytiri.\n* Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, an exobiologist and head of the Avatar Program. She is also Sully's mentor and an advocate of peaceful relations with the Na'vi, having set up a school to teach them English.[45]\n\t+ Weaver also portrays Grace's Na'vi avatar.\n* Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who works in the Avatar Program and comes to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA[46]\n* Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who works for the RDA as Quaritch's right hand man.\n\n\nAdditionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears, uncredited, as Ikeyni, the leader of the Tayrangi clan, Saeyla, one of the young hunters who accompany Jake during his Iknimaya and a harassed blonde woman in a bar that Jake defends. Vela-Bailey served as the stunt double for Zoe Saldana and would later portray Zdinarsk in *Avatar: The Way of Water*. Terry Notary, who performed stunts as well, plays the Banshees via motion capture.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director/writer and producer James Cameron in December 2009 on Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nIn 1994,[12] director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for *Avatar*, drawing inspiration from \"every single science fiction book\" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard.[11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old. He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that would lit up when someone stepped on it. When he woke up he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie.[47] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing *Titanic*, he would film *Avatar*, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors.[14] The project would cost $100\u00a0million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\".[48] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10\u00a0million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for *Avatar*, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[49]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film *Project 880* was \"a retooled version of *Avatar*\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[50] citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones.[11] Cameron had chosen *Avatar* over his project *Battle Angel* after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[51]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC.[11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo M\u0101ori.[16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[52]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[53] often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home.[54] In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would film *Avatar* for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[55] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce *Avatar*.[56] Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined *Avatar* to help with the film's designs.[57] Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors.[58] In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[59]\n\n\nWhile these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to *Avatar* because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, *Titanic*. During the production of *Titanic*, Cameron rewrote the script to streamline the plot by combining several characters' roles and offered to cut his fee if the film were a commercial disappointment.[49] Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[49] In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\" so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook.[49] However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal.[49] In October 2006, Fox finally agreed to commit to making *Avatar* after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237\u00a0million budget.[49] After Fox accepted *Avatar*, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you *can* do this\u00a0...\"[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External audio |\n| --- |\n| James Cameron interviewed by F. X. Feeney on writing Avatar. |\n| ![audio icon](image) Interview[61] |\n\n\nIn December 2006, Cameron described *Avatar* as \"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200\u00a0years hence\u00a0... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\".[62] The January 2007 press release described the film as \"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\" and said the story is of \"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.[36]\n\n\nEstimates put the cost of the film at about $280\u2013310\u00a0million to produce and an estimated $150\u00a0million for marketing, noting that about $30\u00a0million in tax credits would lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.[17][18][19] A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \"$237\u00a0million, with $150\u00a0million for promotion, end of story.\"[4]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Avatar* began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[63] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[64] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for *Avatar* would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[65] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[66]\n\n\nMotion-capture photography lasted 31\u00a0days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles.[51][67] Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days.[68] More than a thousand people worked on the production.[67] In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[69] Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests[70] to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[69]\n\n\nDuring filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\"[71] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[72] Cameron described the system as a \"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\".[73]\n\n\nCameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology.[62] Spielberg said, \"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation\u00a0... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\"[72] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[74]\n\n\nTo film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \"simulcam\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[69]\n\n\nDue to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.[75]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![The left image shows the blue cat-like alien Neyitiri shouting. The right image shows the actress who portrays her, Zoe Saldana, with motion-capture dots across her face and a small camera in front of her eyes.](image)Cameron pioneered a specially designed camera built into a 6-inch boom that allowed the facial expressions of the actors to be captured and digitally recorded for the animators to use later.[76]\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film.[13][14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.[71]\n\n\nInnovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle,[77] a motion-capture stage or \"volume\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers.[78] According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.[79]\nBesides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance.[80] A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.[81]\n\n\nThe lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[82] Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for *Avatar*, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[83] To render *Avatar*, Weta used a 930\u00a0m2 (10,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system.[84][85][86][87] The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta.[88][89] Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage,[90] and each minute of the final footage for *Avatar* occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage.[91] It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[92] To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[93] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[94]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n![](image)\n\nJames Horner\u00a0\u2013 \"Jake Enters His Avatar World\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of the 2009 film *Avatar*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after *Aliens* and *Titanic*.[95] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008.[96]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.[97]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009.[98] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for *Avatar* and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.[69]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace.[100]\n\n\n\n## Themes and inspirations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Themes in *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology.[101]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' *John Carter* series.[11] He acknowledged that *Avatar* shares themes with the films *At Play in the Fields of the Lord*, *The Emerald Forest*, and *Princess Mononoke*, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with *Dances with Wolves*, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.[102][103] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[103]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to \"describe in great detail the\ngenesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be *Avatar*.\"[104] In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between *Avatar* and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for *Xenogenesis*, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in *Avatar*. He stated that *Avatar*'s \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including *Aliens*, *The Abyss*, *Rambo: First Blood Part II*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. He specifically mentioned the \"water tentacle\" in *The Abyss* as an example of an \"avatar\" that \"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.\"[105]\n\n\nCameron also cited a number of works by other creators as \"reference points and sources of inspiration\" for *Avatar*. These include two of his \"favorite\" films, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and *Lawrence of Arabia*, where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story \"In the Imagicon\" and Arthur C. Clarke's novel *The City and the Stars*. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the cyberpunk novels *Neuromancer* by William Gibson and *Islands in the Net* by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including *Dances with Wolves*, *The Man Who Would Be King*, *The Mission*, *The Emerald Forest*, *Medicine Man*, *The Jungle Book* and *FernGully*. He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.[105]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with *Time* magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term *Avatar*, to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\"[10] Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime *Ghost in the Shell*, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[106][107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.[101]\nThe look of the Na'vi\u00a0\u2013 the humanoids indigenous to Pandora\u00a0\u2013 was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on *Avatar*. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\".[101] Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color\u00a0... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,[108] which I like conceptually.\"[109] He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.[101]\n\n\nFor the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, which he said was in the tradition of *Romeo and Juliet*.[105] He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film *Titanic*. An interviewer stated: \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\"[110] Cameron described Neytiri as his \"Pocahontas\", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a \"white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.\"[105] Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists.[111] Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.[110]\n\n\n\n![A gray mountain in the middle of a forest.](image)Pandora's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\" were inspired in part by the Chinese Huangshan mountains (pictured).[112]\n![](image)Zhangjiajie National Forest Park\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\"[113] According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world.[113] Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.[114]\n\n\nTo create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the *Noble Clyde Boudreaux*[115] oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.[116]\n\n\nCameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".[117]\n\n\nCameron acknowledges that *Avatar* implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\"[118] He said in later interviews, \"...\u00a0I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled\u00a0...\"[119] and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"[120]\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September\u00a011 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotions[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con promoting Avatar.](image)Cameron promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009,[121] and *Empire* released exclusive images from the film in its October issue.[122] Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel, moderated by Tom Rothman, at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con on July 23. Twenty-five minutes of footage was screened[123] in Dolby 3D.[124]\nWeaver and Cameron appeared at additional panels to promote the film, speaking on the 23rd[125] and 24th[126][127] respectively. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con *Avatar* Panel that August 21 will be '*Avatar* Day'. On this day, the trailer was released in all theatrical formats. The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day.[128]\n\n\nThe 129-second trailer was released online on August 20, 2009.[129]\nThe new 210-second trailer was premiered in theaters on October 23, 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on October 29, 2009, to positive reviews.[130][131]\nAn extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews.[129] *The Hollywood Reporter* said that audience expectations were colored by \"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded *Titanic*\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling.[132] The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4\u00a0million views.[133]\nOn October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of *Avatar* to a number of press.[134] The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on November 1, 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.[135]\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology.[136] The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox series *Bones* in the episode \"The Gamer In The Grease\" (Season 5, Episode 9). *Avatar* star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film.[137] A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim, when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost.[138] McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \"Avatarize yourself\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.[139]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora*, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released by Harper Entertainment on November 24, 2009.[140]\nIt is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page *James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook* for children.[141] *The Art of Avatar* was released on November 30, 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface.[142] In October 2010, Abrams Books also released *The Making of Avatar*, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.[143]\n\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of *Avatar* after the film was released.[144] In February 2010, producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for *Avatar* that will \"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\", saying that \"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\".[145] In August 2013, it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the *Avatar* universe.[146]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Game* and *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an *Avatar* game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film.[147] *Avatar: The Game* was released on December 1, 2009,[148] for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and December 8 for PlayStation Portable. A second game, *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*, was under development as of 2021.\n\n\n\n### Action figures and postage stamps[edit]\n\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of *Avatar* action figures.[149][150]\nEach action figure will be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is exclusive to each specific action figure.[149] A series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.[151]\n\n\nIn December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on *Avatar*, coinciding with the film's worldwide release.[152]\n\n\n\n## Releases[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18.[153] The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming[154] but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November)[77] and give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors.[155] Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings.[156][157] However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e., screens that increase in width to display 2.39:1 films).[158] During a 3D preview showing in Germany on December 16, the movie's DRM \"protection\" system malfunctioned, and some copies delivered weren't watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere.[159]\n\n\n*Avatar* was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters showed it in 3D. In total, 90% of all advance ticket sales for *Avatar* were for 3D screenings.[160]\n\n\nInternationally, *Avatar* opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross).[161][162] The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on December 18. The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[163] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[164] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released *Avatar* in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".[20]\n\n\n\n#### Post-original release[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D.[165] *Avatar: Special Edition* includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG,[166] including an extension of the sex scene[167] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film.[166] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n*Avatar* was rereleased in theaters on September 23, 2022, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures for a limited two-week engagement, with the film being remastered in 4K high-dynamic range, with select scenes at a high frame rate of 48 fps.[169] The reissue was prior to the December 2022 premiere of its sequel, *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[170] Prior to this, Cameron previously teased a re-release of the film back in 2017 when promoting the Dolby Cinema re-release of *Titanic*, stating that there were plans in the works to remaster the film with Dolby Vision and re-release it in Dolby Cinema.[171]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on April 22, 2010,[172] and in the UK on April 26.[173] The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day.[174] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's 1.78:1 (16:9) format over the 2.39:1 (21:9) scope version as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film.[175] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update.[176][177]\n\n\n*Avatar* set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by *The Dark Knight* (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold.[178] In its first four days of release, sales of *Avatar* on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada\u00a0\u2013 overtaking *The Dark Knight* to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region.[179][180] The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week.[181] In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of 19.7 million DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period.[182] As of July 18, 2012, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 10.5 million units sold with $190,806,055 in revenue.[183] *Avatar* retained its record as the top-selling Blu-ray in the US market until January 2015, when it was surpassed by Disney's *Frozen*.[184]\n\n\nThe *Avatar* three-disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 16, 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut (162 minutes), the special edition cut (170 minutes), and a collector's extended cut (178 minutes). The DVD set spreads the film across two discs, while the Blu-ray set presents it on a single disc.[185] The collector's extended cut contains eight more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\". He stated the \"Earth opening\" is an additional 4+1\u20442 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release.[186] The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.[185]\n\n\nCameron initially stated that *Avatar* would be released in 3D around November 2010, but the studio issued a correction: \"3-D is in the conceptual stage and *Avatar* will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November.\"[187] In May 2010, Fox stated that the 3D version would be released some time in 2011.[182] It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV. The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until February 2012.[188] On October 2010, Cameron stated that the standalone 3D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was \"maybe one, two years out\".[189] On Christmas Eve 2010, *Avatar* had its 3D television world premiere on Sky.[190][191][192]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2012, Cameron announced on Facebook that *Avatar* would be released globally on Blu-ray 3D.[193] The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.[194]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Avatar* on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 20, 2023.[195] Disney will re-release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[196]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 335 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.4 out of ten. The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but *Avatar* reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\"[197] On Metacritic\u2014which assigns a weighted mean score\u2014the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D.[199]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film \"extraordinary\", and gave it four stars out of four. \"Watching *Avatar*, I felt sort of the same as when I saw *Star Wars* in 1977,\" he said, adding that like *Star Wars* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the film \"employs a new generation of special effects\" and it \"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\".[200]\nA. O. Scott of *At The Movies* also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed *Star Wars* and he said \"although the script is a little bit\u00a0... obvious,\" it was \"part of what made it work\".[201][202] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised the film, saying: \"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in *Avatar*, and it's very much a place worth visiting.\"[203] Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the film a positive review. \"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\" he stated.[204] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* awarded *Avatar* a three-and-a-half out of four star rating, and wrote in his print review: \"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\"[205] Richard Corliss of *Time* thought that the film was \"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\"[206] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* thought the film has \"powerful\" visual accomplishments but \"flat dialogue\" and \"obvious characterization\".[207] James Berardinelli of *ReelViews* praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote: \"In 3-D, it's immersive\u00a0\u2013 but the traditional film elements\u00a0\u2013 story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.\u00a0\u2013 are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2+1\u20442-hour experience.\"[208]\n\n\n*Avatar*'s underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the *New York Press* wrote that Cameron used \"villainous American characters\" to \"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\".[209][210] Russell D. Moore of *The Christian Post* concluded that \"propaganda exists in the film\" and stated \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\"[211] Adam Cohen of *The New York Times* was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\".[212] Ross Douthat of *The New York Times* opined that the film is \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism\u00a0[...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\",[213] while Saritha Prabhu of *The Tennessean* called the film a \"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\",[214] and Maxim Osipov of *The Hindustan Times*, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the *Bhagavad Gita*.[215] Annalee Newitz of *io9* concluded that *Avatar* is another film that has the recurring \"fantasy about race\" whereby \"some white guy\" becomes the \"most awesome\" member of a non-white culture.[216] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune* called *Avatar* \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\",[217] while Miranda Devine of *The Sydney Morning Herald* thought that \"It [was] impossible to watch *Avatar* without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\"[218] Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to *Avatar*'s success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\".[219]\n\n\nCritics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \"borrowing\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of *The Boston Globe* called it \"the same movie\" as *Dances with Wolves*.[220] Like *Dances with Wolves*, *Avatar* has been characterized as being a \"white savior\" movie, in which a \"backwards\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture.[221][222] Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette \"Call Me Joe\", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter.[223][224] Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that *Avatar* has elements in common with the 1960s *Noon Universe* novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave.[225] Various reviews have compared *Avatar* to the films *FernGully: The Last Rainforest*,[226][227] *Pocahontas*[228] and *The Last Samurai.*[229] NPR's *Morning Edition* has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that *Avatar* was made by \"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\".[230] Gary Westfahl wrote that \"the science fiction story that most closely resembles *Avatar* has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella *The Word for World Is Forest* (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook\".[224] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \"mash-up\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, *Midworld*.[231] Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which features fantastic images of dragons and floating rock formations.[232][233] In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m.[234] Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and *The Hollywood Reporter* noted that Cameron had won multiple *Avatar* idea theft cases.[235]\n\n\n*Avatar* received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as \"the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since *Star Wars*\" and others calling it \"audacious and awe inspiring\", \"master class\", and \"brilliant\". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film.[236] On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \"It's not in my top three James Cameron films.\u00a0... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\".[237] For French filmmaker Luc Besson, *Avatar* opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series *Val\u00e9rian and Laureline* that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film.[238] *TIME* ranked *Avatar* number 3 in their list of \"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\"[239] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-Time 100 list,[240] and IGN listed *Avatar* as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.[241]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n#### General[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens.[242] It grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada, with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens.[243] The film grossed $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind *I Am Legend*,[22][5] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping *The Incredibles*), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking *Up*'s record),[244] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking *The Day After Tomorrow*'s record),[245] and the 40th-largest opening weekend in North America,[5] despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results.[17][22][23] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5\u00a0million, 12% of the film's $77\u00a0million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.[163]\n\n\nInternational markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10\u00a0million were for Russia ($19.7\u00a0million), France ($17.4\u00a0million), the UK ($13.8\u00a0million), Germany ($13.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($11.7\u00a0million), Australia ($11.5\u00a0million), and Spain ($11.0\u00a0million).[5] *Avatar*'s worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film.[246] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1\u00a0million during the opening weekend.[163]\n\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence,[247] grossing $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office[248] and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time.[249] The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[250] to set a third-weekend record.[251]\n\n\n*Avatar* crossed the $1\u00a0billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days.[252] It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so.[253] In its fourth weekend, *Avatar* continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217,[254] and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States, beating *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen*.[247] In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446,[255] and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612.[256] It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records grossing $34,944,081[257] and $31,280,029[258] respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.[259]\n\n\nOn January 31, it became the first film to gross over $2 billion worldwide,[260] and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in the U.S. and Canada, on February 27, after 72 days of release.[261] It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks\u00a0\u2013 the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since *Titanic* spent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998[262]\u00a0\u2013 and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*.[263] By the end of its first theatrical release *Avatar* had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328.[5]\n\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of *Avatar* featuring extended footage, *Avatar* grossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5] *Avatar* has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed *Titanic*'s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release,[264][265][266] just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[267] On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, *Avatar* surpassed *Titanic* to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States.[268] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[269][270][271][272][273][274] and is the first film to gross over $2\u00a0billion in foreign box office receipts.[275]\nIMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross,[276] more than double the previous record.[277] By 2022, this figure rose to $268.6 million.[278]\n\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, *Avatar* would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[279] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on *Avatar*'s gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that *Avatar* had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace*.[280] On a worldwide basis, when *Avatar*'s gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, *The Daily Telegraph* estimated its gross was surpassed by only *Gone with the Wind* ($3.0 billion), *Titanic* ($2.9 billion), and *Star Wars* ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[281] with *Avatar* ultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5] Reuters even placed it ahead of *Titanic* after adjusting the global total for inflation.[282] The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind *Gone with the Wind* in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[283][284]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster *Titanic*.[285][286][287] This criticism ranged from *Avatar*'s film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\".[285][286] *Slate* magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the *Star Wars* prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect.[288] *The New York Times* noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release *Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel* alongside *Avatar*, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office.[289]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation\u00a0... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on criticism of *Avatar* before its release.[286]\n\nBox office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success.[285][290] \"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for *Avatar.* This is the one. The behemoth.\"[290] The \"cautionary estimate\" was that *Avatar* would bring in around $60\u00a0million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher.[290][291] There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.[285]\n\n\nCameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\" he stated. \"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\"[286] Although he felt *Avatar* would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic,[286] he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\"[292] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that *Avatar* would need significant \"repeat business\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed *Avatar* could inspire the same \"sharing\" reaction as *Titanic*. He said that film worked because, \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing *Titanic*'s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.[293] Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing *Titanic*, such as 2008's *The Dark Knight*,[294] but *Avatar* was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings[293] did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\"[295] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing *Titanic* because \"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when *Titanic* was released.\"[295] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[297]\n\n\n\n> \n> You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, the Tolkiens and the Star Wars and the Star Treks. People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. Like Pandora.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on the success of *Avatar*[298]\n\nAlthough analysts have been unable to agree that *Avatar*'s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\", and this also applied to 2010.[299]\nCameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.[286] *Titanic* capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.[299] Additionally, *Avatar* established itself as a \"must-see\" event. Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see *Avatar* are going to see *Avatar* and would even if the slate was strong.\"[299] Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. \"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.[299] The \"Oscar buzz\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly\u00a0...*Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\", and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than before.[299]\n\n\nAccording to *Variety*, films in 3D accumulated $1.3\u00a0billion in 2009, \"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\". The increased ticket price\u00a0\u2013 an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets\u00a0\u2013 helped the film.[299] Likewise, *Entertainment Weekly* attributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[300] Gray said *Avatar* having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: *Titanic* (historical events), the *Star Wars* movies (an established film franchise), or *The Lord of the Rings* (literature). It was a tougher sell\u00a0...\"[299] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.[302] *Avatar* also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others.[303] At the 36th Saturn Awards, *Avatar* won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\nThe New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award.[304] The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations.[305] It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film.[306] The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for six others, including Best Film and Director.[307] The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned *Avatar*'s cultural impact.[b] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast. Mendelson argued *Avatar*'s only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\"[308] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made *Avatar* sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\"[314]\n\n\nSome have questioned if there is an audience for the film's planned sequels, believing there to be a lack of interest in the face of the multiple delays of their release dates.[311][312][315] Writing for *The Escapist*, Darren Mooney acknowledged that the film had not been broadly remembered in the pop cultural subconscious and had not found a fandom in the same sense as many other popular media, but argued that this was not a negative point, saying, \"its defining legacy is the insistence that it lacks a legacy.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the trailer for *Avatar*'s upcoming sequel and the film's re-release, journalists again questioned the cultural relevance of the film, particularly Patrick Ryan of *USA Today*, who said the film had \"curiously left almost no pop-culture footprint\".[317][318] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called others' opinions that the film had left no cultural impact \"narrow-minded\" and said that the film still held up well.[319] A detailed overview of the *Avatar* franchise was reported in *The New York Times* in December of that year.[320]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Way of Water*, *Avatar 3*, and *Avatar 4*\n\nSee also: *Avatar* (franchise)\n\n*Avatar*'s success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four.[321] *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) grossed over $2.3\u00a0billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022,[322] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response.[323] It will be followed by *Avatar 3* (2025). Fourth and fifth *Avatar* films, titled *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031.[321][324]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toruk \u2013 The First Flight\n\n*Toruk \u2013 The First Flight* is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil which ran between December 2015 and June 2019. Inspired by *Avatar*, the story is set in Pandora's past, involving a prophecy concerning a threat to the Tree of Souls and a quest for totems from different tribes. Audience members could download an app in order to participate in show effects. On January 18, 2016, it was announced via the Toruk Facebook page that filming for a DVD release had been completed and was undergoing editing.[325]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attraction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar\n\nIn 2011, Cameron, Lightstorm, and Fox entered an exclusive licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company to feature *Avatar*-themed attractions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide, including a themed land for Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The area, known as Pandora \u2013 The World of *Avatar*, opened on May 27, 2017.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Avatar*, Cameron planned to write a novel based on the film, \"telling the story of the movie, but [going] into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with.\"[328] In 2013, this plan was superseded by the announcement of four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe\", to be written by Steven Gould.[146] The books were due to be published by Penguin Random House, although since 2017, there has been no update on the planned book series.[329]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)science fiction portal\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* *Red Scorpion*\n* *Run of the Arrow*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[7][8][9]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[308][309][310][311][312][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** LaFraniere, Sharon (January 29, 2010). \"China's Zeal for 'Avatar' Crowds Out 'Confucius'\". *The New York Times*.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS\u00a0*Titanic* in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, David Warner, Suzy Amis and Bill Paxton.\n\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200\u00a0million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84\u00a0billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257\u00a0billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2\u00a0billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS *Titanic*. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the *Titanic* struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 2] After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard *Keldysh*, where she recounts her experiences as a *Titanic* passenger.\n\n\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fianc\u00e9 Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley and Rose's widowed mother Ruth board the *Titanic*. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class *Titanic* ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. Jack soon admits that he has feelings for Rose. When Cal and Ruth object, Rose rejects Jack's attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\n\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\n\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape. Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He poses as a lost child's father to board a lifeboat.\n\n\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The stern slams back onto the ocean, upends again and sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of cold shock, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat. RMS\u00a0*Carpathia* rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket.\n\n\nIn the present, Rose says she heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of *Keldysh*, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[16] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the *Titanic*'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Fictional characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKate Winslet (pictured in 2007), who portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Leonardo DiCaprio (bottom, pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson.\n\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\".[17] Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards *Titanic* with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.\"[17] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role.[18][19][20][21] When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[18] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[18]\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the *Titanic*, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack,\u00a0... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\".[17] Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the *Titanic* in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fianc\u00e9's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993.[22] Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[18][23] Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high.[23] Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition.[24] Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[25] DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[18] Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, \"Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck.[18] Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[26]\n* Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fianc\u00e9, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, who he had previously collaborated with on *The Terminator, Aliens*, and *The Abyss*, for the role,[27] before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[23] and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.[28]\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.\n* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\"[17] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role.[23] Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\"[29] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this *joie de vivre* in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.\"[29]\n* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the *Titanic* in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about *Titanic* for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert. Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio. Jack's Italian best friend, who boards *Titanic* with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the *Titanic* sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\n* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the *Titanic* splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries *S.O.S. Titanic*.\n* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n\n### Historical characters[edit]\n\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[30] the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n\n\n![](image)The real Margaret Brown (right) providing Captain Arthur Henry Rostron with an award for his service in the rescue of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers.\n* Kathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens.[31] Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[32]\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the *Titanic*, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (*Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder*) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40\u00a0a.m.[33] There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[33] It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[33]\n\n\n![](image)Crew of the *Olympic*, 1911. Left: First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right: Captain Edward J. Smith.\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the *Titanic* his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".[34]\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[35][36] After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film *A Night to Remember*.\n* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n\n\n![](image)Wallace Hartley. *Titanic*'s bandmaster and violinist.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany,[37][38] and dies in the sinking.\n* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the *Titanic* struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[39] A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a \u00a35000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[40] Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy.[41] According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"[42]\n* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the *Titanic* was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[43][44]\n* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[45][46][47]\n* Rochelle Rose as No\u00ebl Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\n* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\n* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\n* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow's nest. He survives the sinking.\n* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\n* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.\n* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[48] In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[49][50]\n* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G.

Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the *Titanic*.\n\n\n### Cameos[edit]\n\n\nSeveral crew members of the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the *Mir* self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[51] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the *Titanic* Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director, writer and producer James Cameron (*pictured in 2000*)\n> \n> The story could not have been written better had it been fiction\u00a0...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable\u00a0... the unthinkable possible.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014James Cameron[54][55]\n\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him *Titanic* was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[56][57][58] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, *Titanica*, was made from footage shot of the *Titanic* wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[56]\n\n\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a *Titanic* film,[59] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"*Romeo and Juliet* on the *Titanic*\".[57][58] Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[18] They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[18][23][29]\n\n\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the *Titanic* wreck,[59] and organized several dives over a period of two years.[54] He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: \"We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money \u2013 or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[57]\n\n\nThe crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[23] Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[23] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with *Titanic*'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.[60]\n\n\nDescending to the site emphasized to the crew that the *Titanic* disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: \"Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" He felt a \"great mantle of responsibility\" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[29]\n\n\nCameron felt the *Titanic* sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[54] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[51] He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[54] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in *Titanic* I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[29]\n\n\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[59] He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the *Titanic*'s crew and passengers.[54] He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[57] From the beginning of the shoot, the team had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said. \"That set the bar higher in a way \u2013 it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[57] Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about *Titanic*, *A Night to Remember*, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[61] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.[30]\n\n\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[54] While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[62][63] Cameron said \"the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Scale modeling[edit]\n\n\n![A ship resembling the Titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small waves.](image)The reconstruction of *Titanic*. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[64][65]\nHarland and Wolff, *Titanic*'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[64] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the *Titanic*'s sister ship RMS\u00a0*Olympic*.[65] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49\u00a0m) tower crane on 600 feet (180\u00a0m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[51]\n\n\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the *Titanic* were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the *Titanic*'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on *Titanic*'s original designs.[66] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[67] Cameron hired two *Titanic* historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[23]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996[15] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*.[51] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale *Titanic* had been constructed.[51] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[68] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[69] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[68] Cameron built his *Titanic* on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[70] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[23] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.[71][72]\n\n\n\n![A pencil-drawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked, only wearing a diamond necklace. From the breast down the picture is cut off.](image)Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[29]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[73] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[29] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[29]\n\n\nThe shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood\". He became known as an \"uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[74] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[74] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[74] Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.\"[74] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[74] In response to the criticism, Cameron said, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[74] More than 800 crew members worked on the film, a large number for any Hollywood production.[75]\n\n\nOn August 9, 1996, during the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[18][76] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[76] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[18] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[18][74] The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[77] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[62][78]\n\n\n\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[15] Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[78] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[78] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[79] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\n\n\n> I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe costs of filming *Titanic* ballooned and eventually reached $200\u00a0million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1\u00a0million per minute of screen time.[80] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[18] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[18] Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights.[81] Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.[82]\n\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"...\u00a0the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than *T2* and *True Lies.* Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. *Titanic* also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-production[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on *The Abyss* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Many previous films about *Titanic* shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[83] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14\u00a0m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[84] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20\u00a0m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[83] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS *Jeremiah O'Brien*'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[85] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[86] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[87]\n\n\n\n![The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.](image)Unlike previous *Titanic* films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000\u00a0L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000\u00a0L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227\u00a0m) exterior of *Titanic* had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[51] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000\u00a0L) tank,[88] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[64]\n\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous *Titanic* films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[23] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[23]\n\n\nA Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[89]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nCameron said there were aspects of the *Titanic* story that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS *Californian*, the ship that was close to the *Titanic* the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the *Californian* was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world. If *Titanic* is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it, but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the *Titanic*'s sinking.[90] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary: \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better\u00a0... You didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then\u00a0... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.\"[91]\n\n\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[92] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[92]\n\n\n\n### Heart of the Ocean[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2\u00a0g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[93] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[94] for $1.4\u00a0million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture* and *Back to Titanic*\n\nCameron wrote *Titanic* while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya.[95] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[96] Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on *Aliens,*[97] but *Titanic* cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[98] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album *Innerst i sjelen*, and particularly liked how she sang \"*Eg veit i himmerik ei borg*\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[99]\n\n\nHorner wrote the end theme, \"My Heart Will Go On\", in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[100] C\u00e9line Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[100] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release.[81] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[101] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[23] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[23] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film *Air Force One* was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative *Indiana Jones* and *Jack Ryan* franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released *Titanic* so close to his own film.[102] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[75] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[23]\n\n\nCameron refused to hold the film's world premiere in Los Angeles.[82] Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[103][82] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by *The New York Times*.[104] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, *Titanic* earned $674.3\u00a0million in North America and $1.583\u00a0billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257\u00a0billion.[Note 1][14] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating *Jurassic Park* (1993).[105] The film remained so for twelve years, until *Avatar* (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[106] On March 1, 1998,[107] it became the first film to earn more than $1\u00a0billion worldwide[108] and on the weekend April 13\u201315, 2012\u2014a century after the original vessel's foundering, *Titanic* became the second film to cross the $2\u00a0billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[109] Box Office Mojo estimates that *Titanic* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[110] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128\u00a0million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[111]\n\n\n*Titanic* was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[112] A *Hindustan Times* report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[113]\n\n\n\n### Initial theatrical run[edit]\n\n\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of *Mouse Hunt*, *Scream 2* and the eighteenth James Bond film, *Tomorrow Never Dies*. It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2\u00a0million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6\u00a0million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120\u00a0million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300\u00a0million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by *Jurassic Park*, which took 67 days to do so.[115] *Titanic* would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace*.[116]\n\n\nIts highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[117][118] On March 14, it surpassed *Star Wars* as the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[119] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[120] By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken by *Lost in Space*, dropping into second place.[121] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[122] equivalent to $1140.3\u00a0 million in 2023[123]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[124] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[125]\n\n\n\n### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Titanic*'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[74][126][127][128] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs \u2013 because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[127] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on *Titanic* in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100\u00a0million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[74]\n\n\n\n> \n> It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: \"I'm the king of the world!\" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in *Titanic*, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant \"eff off\", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Christopher Goodwin of *The Times* on Cameron's response to *Titanic*'s criticism[74]\n\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[126] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[127] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[129] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[127] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen *Titanic* twice by its fifth week.[130] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[131] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[129][132] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487\u00a0million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4\u00a0billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4\u00a0billion after ancillary sources.[133]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s impact on men has also been especially credited.[134][135][136] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[134][135] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[134] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film *Zombieland*, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since *Titanic*.\"[137]\n\n\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during *Titanic* and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of *Titanic* as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during *Titanic* will readily admit to becoming choked up during *Saving Private Ryan* or *Platoon.*\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[135]\n\n\nScott Meslow of *The Atlantic* stated while *Titanic* initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing *Titanic* as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone\u2014including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like *Iron Man*, it is common for boys and men to deny liking *Titanic*. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) *Titanic* an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"*Titanic* has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[136]\n\n\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. *Titanic*'s catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[138][139] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[139]\n\n\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how *Titanic* worked.\"[140] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for *Titanic* was over 20%.\"[23] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30\u00a0am\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[141] Cameron's follow-up film, *Avatar*, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[142][143] and did so in 2010.[106] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge *Titanic* were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly\u00a0... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. *Titanic* just struck some kind of chord.\"[129] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once *Avatar*'s performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[143]\n\n\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing *Titanic*'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s\u00a0\u2013 awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[145][146][147] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[132] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[148] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[149]\n\n\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding\u00a0... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[150] He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[151] On the television program *Siskel & Ebert*, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[152]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, *Titanic* is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch *Titanic*, you experience it.\"[153] It was named his second best film of 1997.[154] Joseph McBride of *Boxoffice Magazine* concluded: \"To describe *Titanic* as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[155]\n\n\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of *Urban Cinefile* said: \"You will walk out of *Titanic* not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[156] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[155] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* commented that \"Cameron's magnificent *Titanic* is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to *Gone With the Wind*.\"[155] Adrian Turner of *Radio Times* awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. *Titanic* is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[157]\n\n\n*Titanic* suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[147] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[158] Kenneth Turan's review in the *Los Angeles Times* was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\"[159] He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[160] Barbara Shulgasser of *The San Francisco Examiner* gave *Titanic* one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of */Film*, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, *Titanic* is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[162] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[163] Similarly, French New Wave director and former *Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma* editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\"[164] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[165] but it also topped a poll by *Film 2003* as \"the worst movie of all time\".[166]\n\n\nIn his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the *Titanic*, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.\"[167] The British film magazine *Empire* reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[168] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[169] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me\u00a0...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike *Titanic*, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[128]\n\n\nIn 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"*Titanic* is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless \u2013 and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for clich\u00e9,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[170]\n\n\nIn 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's *Titanic* was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[171] *Empire* eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's *Titanic* at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[172]\n\n\nIn 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[173] It was listed among the 100 best films in an *Empire* poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[174][175] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement \u2014 one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, *Titanic* demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Titanic*\n\nAt the Golden Globes, *Titanic* won Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[176] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[177] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's *All About Eve*[178] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the *Titanic* to win that award, after 1933's *Cavalcade*), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[179] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in *As Good as It Gets*, Kim Basinger in *L.A. Confidential* and *Men in Black*.[180][181] *Titanic* was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after *Ben-Hur (1959).*[182] *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* matched the record in 2004.[183]\n\n\n*Titanic* won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[184][185] The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[186] It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US.[187] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\n\n*Titanic* also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[188] It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[*citation needed*] The book about the making of the film was at the top of *The New York Times*' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years\u00a0... series six times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| AFI's 100 Years\u00a0... 100\n | Rank\n | Source\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thrills | 25\n | [189] | A list of the top 100 thrilling films in American cinema, compiled in 2001.\n |\n| Passions | 37\n | [190] | A list of the top 100 love stories in American cinema, compiled in 2002.\n |\n| Songs | 14\n | [191] | A list of the top 100 songs in American cinema, compiled in 2004. *Titanic* ranked 14th for C\u00e9line Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\".\n |\n| Movie quotes | 100\n | [138] | A list of the top 100 film quotations in American cinema, compiled in 2005. *Titanic* ranked 100th for Jack Dawson's yell of \"*I'm the king of the world!*\"\n |\n| Movies | 83\n | [192] | A 2007 (10th anniversary) edition of 1997's list of the 100 best films of the past century. *Titanic* was not eligible when the original list was released.\n |\n| AFI's 10 Top 10 | 6\n | [193] | The 2008 poll consisted of the top ten films in ten different genres. *Titanic* ranked as the sixth-best epic film.\n |\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[194] More than $50\u00a0million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[195] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25\u00a0million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500\u00a0million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating *Independence Day*.[196] In that time, it sold 58\u00a0million copies worldwide, outselling *The Lion King* for a total worldwide revenue of $995\u00a0million.[196] By March 2005, the film has sold 8\u00a0million DVD and 59\u00a0million VHS units.[197] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1\u00a0million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2\u00a0million home video units during its first day.[198] Within the first week of release, *Titanic* quickly beat *The Full Monty*, selling a total of 1.8\u00a0million home video copies.[199]\n\n\nA DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[200] At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original *Titanic* DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[200]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc *Special Collector's Edition* was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the *Special Edition* and *Deluxe Collector's Edition* respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title *Deluxe Limited Edition*, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[128] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a *10th Anniversary Edition* was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[201]\n\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012.[202] The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 *Special Collector's Edition* DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\"[203] The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.[204]\n\n\nA 4K release of the film is scheduled to be released by Paramount in North America and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in international markets on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.[205][206][207] [208]\n\n\n\n## Re-releases[edit]\n\n\n### 3D conversion[edit]\n\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The *Titanic* 3D version took 60 weeks and $18\u00a0million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[209] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[210] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[211] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)An accurate view of the Milky Way was used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo from Paranal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20\u00a0am on April 15, 1912.\nThe 3D version of *Titanic* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[213][214] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of *Titanic* embarking on her maiden voyage.[215][216][217]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1\u20442 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies *Titanic*. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[218] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[219] Richard Corliss of *Time*, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments\u00a0... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[220] Ann Hornaday for *The Washington Post* found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[221]\n\n\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7\u00a0million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3\u00a0million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind *The Hunger Games* and *American Reunion*.[222][223] Outside North America it earned $35.2\u00a0million, finishing second,[224] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9\u00a0million.[225] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6\u00a0million on its opening day,[226] going on to earn a record-breaking $67\u00a0million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[225]\n\n\nThe reissue earned $343.4\u00a0million worldwide, with $145\u00a0million coming from China and $57.8\u00a0million from Canada and the United States.[227] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350\u00a0million, the 3D re-release of *Titanic* remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of *The Lion King*, *Star Wars*, and *Avatar*.[228]\n\n\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### 20th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, *Titanic* was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[232]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century's logo with the studio's current name, as a result of Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.[233]\n\n\n\n## *Titanic Live*[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic Live* was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[234][*non-primary source needed*] In April 2015, *Titanic Live* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[235]\n\n\n\n## Merchandise[edit]\n\n\n* In 1998, an official tie-in CD-ROM game was released, titled *James Cameron's Titanic Explorer*.[236] The educational game covered the history of the vessel's construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film's sets.[237]\n* In 2020, a board game based on the film, titled *Titanic: The Game*, was released by Spin Master Games.[238]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Academy Award records\n* List of films by box office admissions\n* *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The totals given for *Titanic* at Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are both incorrect. Box Office Mojo has been plagued by errors for re-released films since the site was overhauled in 2019, whereby it often double-counts older grosses, as is the case for *Titanic*. As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that *Titanic* had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.[7] Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.[8] By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.[9] At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.[10] The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).[11] A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.[12] Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure. For clarity, *Titanic* earned $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 2012 reissue, $691,642 from the 2017 reissue, and $71,352 in 2020, for a lifetime total of $2,187,687,082 from the first four releases. Along with the $70.2 million grossed from the 25th anniversary re-release in 2023,[13] the lifetime total for *Titanic* stands at $2,257,844,554 as of May\u00a022, 2023[update].\n2. **^** Although the *Titanic* hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Titanic (1997)\". *Film & TV Database*.

It was the first film released in the *Star Wars* film series and the fourth chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set \"a long time ago\" in a fictional universe where the galaxy is ruled by the tyrannical Galactic Empire, the story focuses on a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance, who aim to destroy the Empire's newest weapon, the Death Star. When Rebel leader Princess Leia is apprehended by the Empire, Luke Skywalker acquires stolen architectural plans of the Death Star and sets out to rescue her while learning the ways of a metaphysical power known as \"the Force\" from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. The cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew.\n\n\nLucas had the idea for a science-fiction film in the vein of *Flash Gordon* around the time he completed his first film, *THX 1138* (1971), and began working on a treatment after the release of *American Graffiti* (1973). After numerous rewrites, filming took place throughout 1975 and 1976 in locations including Tunisia and Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England. The film suffered production difficulties; the cast and crew involved believed the film would be a failure. Lucas formed the visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic to help create the film's special effects. It also went $3 million over budget due to delays.\n\n\nFew were confident in the film's box office prospects. It was released in a small number of theaters in the United States on May 25, 1977, and quickly became a surprise blockbuster hit, leading to it being expanded to a much wider release. The film opened to critical acclaim for its acting, direction, story, musical score, action sequences, sound, editing, screenplay, costume design, and production values, but particularly for its groundbreaking visual effects. It grossed $410 million worldwide during its initial run, surpassing *Jaws* (1975) to become the highest-grossing film until the release of *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982); subsequent releases brought its total gross to $775 million. When adjusted for inflation, *Star Wars* is the second-highest-grossing film in North America (behind *Gone with the Wind*) and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time. It received numerous awards at the Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, and Saturn Awards, among others. The film has been reissued many times with Lucas's support\u2014most significantly with its 20th-anniversary theatrical \"Special Edition\"\u2014incorporating many changes including modified computer-generated effects, altered dialogue, re-edited shots, remixed soundtracks and added scenes.\n\n\nOften regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, the film became a pop-cultural phenomenon, launching an industry of tie-in products, including novels, comics, video games, amusement park attractions and merchandise including toys, games, and clothing. It became one of the first 25 films selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1989, while its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2004. *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi* (1983) followed *Star Wars*, rounding out the original *Star Wars* trilogy. A\u00a0prequel and a sequel trilogy have since been released, in addition to two anthology films and various television series.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nLuke Skywalker (Hamill), Princess Leia (Fisher), and Han Solo (Ford)\n\nAmid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans to the tyrannical Galactic Empire's Death Star, a massive space station capable of destroying entire planets. Imperial Senator Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly one of the Rebellion's leaders, has obtained its schematics, but her ship is intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer under the command of the ruthless Darth Vader. Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory system of astromech droid R2-D2, who flees in an escape pod to the nearby desert planet Tatooine alongside his companion, protocol droid C-3PO.\n\n\nThe droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew Luke Skywalker. While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he discovers a holographic recording of Leia requesting help from one Obi-Wan Kenobi. Later, R2-D2 is missing, and while searching for him, Luke is attacked by scavenging Sand People. He is rescued by elderly hermit Obi-Wan Kenobi, who tells Luke of his days as one of the Jedi Knights, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic, who drew mystical abilities from a metaphysical energy field known as \"the Force\", but were ultimately hunted to near-extinction by the Empire. Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan offers Luke his father's old lightsaber, the signature weapon of Jedi Knights.\n\n\nR2-D2 plays Leia's full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to Alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. Although Luke initially declines Obi-Wan's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force, he is left with no choice after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle and destroyed their farm in their search for the droids. Traveling to a cantina in Mos Eisley to search for transport, Luke and Obi-Wan hire Han Solo, a smuggler indebted to local mobster Jabba the Hutt. Pursued by stormtroopers, Obi-Wan, Luke, R2-D2, and C-3PO flee Tatooine with Han and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca on their ship, the *Millennium Falcon*.\n\n\nBefore the *Falcon* can reach Alderaan, Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin destroys the planet after interrogating Leia for the location of the Rebel Alliance's base. Upon arrival, the *Falcon* is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, but the group evades capture by hiding in the ship's smuggling compartments. As Obi-Wan leaves to disable the tractor beam, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia after discovering that she is scheduled to be executed. After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader, allowing the rest of the group to escape the Death Star with Leia. Using a tracking device, the Empire tracks the *Falcon* to the hidden Rebel base on Yavin IV.\n\n\nThe schematics reveal a hidden weakness in the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, which could allow the Rebels to trigger a chain reaction in its main reactor with a precise proton torpedo strike. Han leaves the Rebels to pay off Jabba, after collecting his reward for rescuing Leia. Luke joins their X-wing starfighter squadron in a desperate attack against the approaching Death Star. In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffer heavy losses as Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters against them. Han and Chewbacca unexpectedly return to aid them in the *Falcon*, and knock Vader's ship off course before he can shoot Luke down. Guided by the voice of Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, destroying the Death Star moments before it fires on the Rebel base. In a triumphant ceremony at the base, Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n![A photograph of Mark Hamill](image)\n![A photograph of Harrison Ford](image)\n![A photograph of Carrie Fisher](image)\n![A photograph of Anthony Daniels](image)\n![A photograph of Kenny Baker](image)\n![A photograph of Peter Mayhew](image)\n![A photograph of David Prowse](image)\n![A photograph of James Earl Jones](image)\n![A photograph of Alec Guinness](image)\nTop: Mark Hamill (2019), Harrison Ford (2017), and Carrie Fisher (2013)  \nMiddle: Anthony Daniels (2011), Kenny Baker (2012), Peter Mayhew (2015)  \nBottom: David Prowse (2013), James Earl Jones (2013), Alec Guinness (1973)\n\n* Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: A young adult raised by his aunt and uncle on Tatooine, who dreams of something more than his current life and learns about the Force and the Jedi. Lucas favored casting young actors who lacked long experience. To play Luke (then known as Luke Starkiller), Lucas sought actors who could project intelligence and integrity. While reading the script, Hamill found the dialogue to be extremely odd because of its universe-embedded concepts. He chose to simply read it sincerely, and he was cast instead of William Katt, who was subsequently cast in Brian De Palma's *Carrie* (Lucas shared a joint casting session with De Palma, a longtime friend).[5][6] Robby Benson, Will Seltzer, Charles Martin Smith and Kurt Russell also auditioned for the role.[7][8][9][10][11]\n* Harrison Ford as Han Solo: A cynical smuggler and captain of the *Millennium Falcon*. Lucas initially rejected casting Ford for the role, as he \"wanted new faces\"; Ford had previously worked with Lucas on *American Graffiti*. Instead, Lucas asked Ford to assist in the auditions by reading lines with the other actors and explaining the concepts and history behind the scenes that they were reading. Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's portrayal and cast him instead of Kurt Russell, Nick Nolte,[6] Sylvester Stallone,[12] Bill Murray,[13][14] Christopher Walken, Burt Reynolds, Jack Nicholson, James Caan,[15] Robert De Niro, Kelsey Grammer,[16] Al Pacino, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, or Perry King (who later played Han Solo in the radio plays).[5][17][18]\n* Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa: The princess of the planet Alderaan who is a member of the Imperial Senate and, secretly, one of the leaders of the Rebel Alliance. Many young Hollywood actresses auditioned for the role of Princess Leia, including Amy Irving,[6] Terri Nunn, Cindy Williams,[5] Linda Purl,[19] Karen Allen,[6] and Jodie Foster.[20][21][22] Koo Stark was considered but ended up getting the role of Camie Marstrap, Luke Skywalker's friend, a character that did not make the final cut of the film.[23][24][a] Fisher was cast under the condition that she lose 10 pounds (4.5\u00a0kg) for the role.[26]\n* Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin: The commander of the Death Star. Lucas originally offered the role to Christopher Lee but he declined.[27] Lucas originally had Cushing in mind for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Lucas believed that \"his lean features\" would be better employed in the role of Tarkin instead. Lucas commended Cushing's performance, saying \"[He] is a very good actor. Adored and idolized by young people and by people who go to see a certain kind of movie. I feel he will be fondly remembered for the next 350 years at least.\" Cushing, commenting on his role, joked: \"I've often wondered what a 'Grand Moff' was. It sounds like something that flew out of a cupboard.\"[28]\n* Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi: An aging Jedi Master and veteran of the Clone Wars who introduces Luke to the Force. Lucas's decision to cast \"unknowns\" was not taken favorably by his friend Francis Ford Coppola and the studio, so Lucas decided Obi-Wan Kenobi should be played by an established actor. Producer Gary Kurtz said, \"The Alec Guinness role required a certain stability and gravitas as a character... which meant we needed a very, very strong character actor to play that part.\"[5] Before Guinness was cast, Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune (who starred in many Akira Kurosawa films) was considered for the role.[6][29] According to Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, her father turned down Lucas' offers to play Kenobi and Darth Vader because \"he was concerned about how the film would look and that it would cheapen the image of samurai... At the time, sci-fi movies still looked quite cheap as the effects were not advanced and he had a lot of samurai pride.\"[30] Guinness was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be successful; he negotiated a deal for 2.25% of the one-fifth gross royalties paid to Lucas, which made him quite wealthy in later life. He agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film.[31] Lucas credited him with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to the completion of the filming.[32] Harrison Ford said, \"It was, for me, fascinating to watch Alec Guinness. He was always prepared, always professional, always very kind to the other actors. He had a very clear head about how to serve the story.\"[5]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A protocol droid affiliated with the Rebellion who is \"fluent in over six million forms of communication\". Daniels auditioned for and was cast as C-3PO; he has said that he wanted the role after he saw a Ralph McQuarrie drawing of the character and was struck by the vulnerability in the robot's face.[5][33] Initially, Lucas did not intend to use Daniels' voice for C-3PO. Thirty well-established voice actors read for the voice of the droid. According to Daniels, one of the major voice actors, believed by some sources to be Stan Freberg, recommended Daniels' voice for the role.[5][34] Mel Blanc was considered for the role, but according to Daniels, Blanc told Lucas that Daniels was better for the part.[7][35] Richard Dreyfuss was also considered.[36]\n* Kenny Baker as R2-D2: An astromech droid and C-3PO's companion, who is carrying the Death Star plans and a secret message for Obi-Wan from Princess Leia. When filming was under way in London, where additional casting took place, Baker, performing a musical comedy act with his acting partner Jack Purvis, learned that the film crew was looking for a small person to fit inside a robot suit and maneuver it. Baker, who was 3\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (1.12\u00a0m) tall, was cast immediately after meeting George Lucas. He said, \"He saw me come in and said 'He'll do' because I was the smallest guy they'd seen up until then.\" He initially turned down the role three times, hesitant to appear in a film where his face would not be shown and hoping to continue the success of his comedy act, which had recently started to be televised.[37] R2-D2's recognizable beeps and squeaks were made by sound designer Ben Burtt imitating \"baby noises\", recording this voice as it was heard on an intercom, and creating the final mix using a synthesizer.[38]\n* Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: A Wookiee, Han Solo's sidekick, and first mate of the *Millennium Falcon*. Mayhew learned of a casting call for *Star Wars*, which was being shot in London, and decided to audition. The 7-foot-3-inch (2.21\u00a0m) tall actor was immediately cast as Chewbacca after he stood up to greet Lucas.[5][39] He recounted, \"I sat down on one of the sofas, waiting for George. Door opened, and George walked in with Gary behind him. So, naturally, what did I do? I'm raised in England. Soon as someone comes in through the door, I stand up. George goes 'Hmm [looked up].' Virtually turned to Gary, and said 'I think we've found him.'[5] Mayhew originally auditioned for Darth Vader, but David Prowse was cast instead.[39][40] Mayhew modeled his performance of Chewbacca after the mannerisms of animals he saw at public zoos.[31]\n* David Prowse as Darth Vader: Obi-Wan's former Jedi apprentice, who fell to the dark side of the Force. Prowse was originally offered the role of Chewbacca, but turned it down as he wanted to play the villain instead.[41] Lucas dismissed Prowse for the character's voice due to his West Country English accent, which led to him being nicknamed \"Darth Farmer\" by the other cast members.[38]\n* James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader; he was uncredited until 1983. Lucas originally considered for Orson Welles to voice the character after dismissing Prowse.[38] However, Lucas was too concerned that Welles' voice would be too familiar to audiences, he instead cast then-relatively less recognizable Jones.[5][6][42]\n\n\nOther actors include Phil Brown and Shelagh Fraser as Luke's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru; Jack Purvis, Kenny Baker's partner in his London comedy act, as the Chief Jawa in the film; and Eddie Byrne as Vanden Willard, a Rebel general.[43] Denis Lawson and Garrick Hagon played rebel pilots Wedge Antilles and Biggs Darklighter (Luke's childhood friend), respectively. Don Henderson and Leslie Schofield appear as Imperial Generals Cassio Tagge and Moradmin Bast, respectively, and Richard LeParmentier plays Admiral Motti.[44] Alex McCrindle portrays General Jan Dodonna, Alfie Curtis portrays Dr. Evazan, and Peter Geddis portrays Captain Raymus Antilles. Michael Leader plays a minor role as a Stormtrooper known for accidentally hitting his helmet against a door.[45][46] Heavily synthesised audio recordings of John Wayne from earlier films were used as the voice of the Imperial spy Garindan.[47][48] Robert Clarke appears as Imperial officer Wulff Yularen and Patrick Jordan plays another Imperial officer, Siward Cass.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director/writer George Lucas in 2007. Lucas described the difficulty of pitching *Star Wars*, being turned down repeatedly, until 20th Century-Fox bought the idea for \"a little strange\" film.[49]\nLucas had the idea for a space-fantasy film in 1971, after he completed directing his first full-length feature, *THX 1138.*[50] Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the *Flash Gordon* space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young.[51] He later said:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> I especially loved the *Flash Gordon* serials ... Of course I realize now how crude and badly done they were ... loving them that much when they were so awful, I began to wonder what would happen if they were done really well.[52]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAt the Cannes Film Festival following the completion of *THX 1138,* Lucas pushed towards buying the *Flash Gordon* rights, but they were already tied-up with Dino De Laurentiis.[52] Lucas later recounted:\n\n\n\n\n> I wanted to make a *Flash Gordon* movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the original *Flash Gordon* comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of *Tarzan*) and especially from his *John Carter of Mars* series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science fantasy called *Gulliver on Mars*, written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.[50]\n> \n> \n\n\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola, who accompanied Lucas in trying to buy the *Flash Gordon* rights, recounted in 1999: \"[George] was very depressed because he had just come back and they wouldn't sell him *Flash Gordon*. And he says, 'Well, I'll just invent my own.'\"[52][53] He secured a two-film development deal with United Artists; the two films were *American Graffiti* and a space opera, tentatively titled \"*The Star Wars*\" and inspired by *Flash Gordon*.[54] Lucas would later say that he had the idea for an original space opera long before 1971,[55] and that he even tried to film it before *American Graffiti*.[56] Believing that the bleak tone of *THX 1138* led to its poor reception, Lucas chose to make *Star Wars* more optimistic; this is what led to its fun and adventurous tone.[57]\n\n![](image)Lucas's early plan was to buy the rights to the *Flash Gordon* film serials and comics of the 1930s and 1940s.\nLucas went to United Artists and showed them the script for *American Graffiti*, but they passed on the film, which was then picked up by Universal Pictures.[53] United Artists also passed on Lucas's space-opera concept, which he shelved for the time being.[58] After spending the next two years completing *American Graffiti*, Lucas turned his attention to his space opera.[50][53] He drew inspiration from politics of the era, later saying, \"It was really about the Vietnam War, and that was the period where Nixon was trying to run for a [second] term.\"[59][60]\n\n\nLucas began writing in January 1973, \"eight hours a day, five days a week\",[50] by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterizations. Lucas would discard many of these by the time the final script was written, but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels. He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two-page synopsis titled *Journal of the Whills*, which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a \"Jedi-Bendu\" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.[61] Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand,[62] Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called *The Star Wars* on April 17, 1973, which had narrative parallels with Kurosawa's 1958 film *The Hidden Fortress*.[63]\n\n\nWhile impressed with the \"innocence of the story, plus the sophistication of the world\"[56] of the film, United Artists declined to budget the film. Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed *American Graffiti*; while they agreed it could be \"a very commercial venture\", they had doubts about Mr. Lucas's ability to pull it all off,[56] and said that Lucas should follow *American Graffiti* with more consequential themes.[49] Coppola brought the project to a division of Paramount Pictures he ran with fellow directors Peter Bogdanovich and William Friedkin, but Friedkin questioned Lucas's ability to direct the film and he, along with Bogdanovich, declined to back it.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Star Wars* producer Gary Kurtz in 2012\nLucas said, \"I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films.\"[49] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the head of Universal, \"just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience.\"[65] He said that \"science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... what seems to be the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year.\"[66] Kurtz said, \"Although *Star Wars* wasn't like [then-current science fiction] at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of category.\"[65]\n\n\nLucas explained in 1977 that the film is not \"about the future\" and that it \"is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to *2001*.\" He added: \"My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had Westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have *The Six Million Dollar Man* and *Kojak*. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?\"[49] Lucas would later recontextualize the discussion around the film, saying it was born out of research into \"psychological underpinnings of mythology\", a claim that had been dismissed by Kurtz: \"The whole idea of Star Wars as a mythological thing, I think came about because of [later Lucas] interviews that tied it to *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*\"[67] and by Steven Hart and Michael Kaminski: \"It is here that the true origin of *Star Wars* comes from \u2013 not from myth and legend, but from the 'schlock' sold on newspapers stands and played in matinees.\"[68]\n\n\nThere were also concerns regarding the project's potentially high budget. Lucas and Kurtz, in pitching the film, said that it would be \"low-budget, Roger Corman style, and the budget was never going to be more than\u2014well, originally we had proposed about 8 million, it ended up being about 10. Both of those figures are very low budget by Hollywood standards at the time.\"[65] After Walt Disney Productions turned down the project,[*citation needed*] Lucas and Kurtz persisted in securing a studio to support the film because \"other people had read it and said, 'Yeah, it could be a good idea.'\"[65] Lucas pursued Alan Ladd Jr., the head of 20th Century-Fox, and in June 1973 completed a deal to write and direct the film. Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd \"invested in me, he did not invest in the movie.\"[5] The deal gave Lucas $150,000 to write and direct the film.[31] *American Graffiti*'s positive reception afforded Lucas the leverage necessary to renegotiate his deal with Ladd and request the sequel rights to the film in August 1973. For Lucas, this deal protected *Star Wars*'s potential sequels and most of the merchandising profits.[5]:\u200a19\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n> \n> It's the flotsam and jetsam from the period when I was twelve years old. All the books and films and comics that I liked when I was a child. The plot is simple\u2014good against evil\u2014and the film is designed to be all the fun things and fantasy things I remember. The word for this movie is fun.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014George Lucas, 1977[49]\n\nSince commencing his writing process in January 1973, Lucas had done \"various rewrites in the evenings after the day's work.\" He would write four different screenplays for *Star Wars*, \"searching for just the right ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a story.\"[50] By May 1974, he had expanded the treatment for *The Star Wars* into a rough draft screenplay,[5]:\u200a14[69] adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role as a member of a family of dwarfs.[5][34] Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as eponym for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's \"co-pilot\" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.[34][70]\n\n\nLucas completed a second draft in January 1975 as *Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode One: The Star Wars*, making heavy simplifications and introducing the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. \"The Force\" was also introduced as a mystical energy field.[69] This draft still had some differences from the final version in the characters and relationships. For example, Luke had several brothers, as well as his father, who appears in a minor role at the end of the film. The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the action/adventure of the previous versions. This version ended with another text crawl, previewing the next story in the series. This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side: the draft included a historical Jedi who was the first to ever fall to the dark side, and then trained the Sith to use it. The script would introduce the concept of a Jedi Master and his son, who trains to be a Jedi under his father's friend; this would ultimately form the basis for the film and, later, the trilogy. However, in this draft, the father is a hero who is still alive at the start of the film.[71] Han Solo and Chewbacca's identities closely resembled those seen in the finished film.[72] According to Lucas, the second draft was over 200 pages long, and led him to split up the story into multiple films spanning over multiple trilogies.[73]\n\n\nLucas began to rewrite this draft, creating a synopsis for the third draft. During work on this rewrite, Lucas began researching the science-fiction genre by watching films and reading books (including J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit*)*[74]*[75] and comics.[76] He also claims to have read scholastic works like Joseph Campbell's *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*,[77] James George Frazer's *The Golden Bough*,[74] and even Bruno Bettelheim's *The Uses of Enchantment.*[78] These claims are doubted by Michael Kaminski and Chris Taylor, with Kaminski pointing out that Bettelheim's book would not come out until after *Star Wars* was filmed and adding that \"the original trilogy-Campbell connection is greatly exaggerated and practically non-existent\",[78] noting that, in fact, the second draft is \"even closer to Campbell's structure\" than the third.[78]\n\n\nAccording to Lucas, he wrote a rough draft of about 250\u2013300 pages long, which contained the outline for the entire original *Star Wars* trilogy. He realized that it was too long for a single film, and decided to subdivide it into a trilogy.[5][79][80] Lucas stated that the story evolved over time and that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now [in 1983] ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.\"[81] He later described that, having split the script into three episodes, \"the first part didn't really work\",[82] so he had to take the ending off of *Episode VI* and put it in the original *Star Wars*, which resulted in a Death Star being included in both films.[83][b] In 1975, Lucas suggested he could make a trilogy, which \"ends with the destruction of the Empire\" and a possible prequel \"about the backstory of Kenobi as a young man\". After the film's smash success,[86] Lucasfilm announced that Lucas had already written \"twelve stories in the *Adventures of Luke Skywalker*\"[87] which, according to Kurtz, were set to be \"separate adventures rather than direct sequels.\"[88]\n\n\nDuring the writing of the third draft, Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes, several of which Lucas included with his screenplay when he delivered it to 20th Century-Fox.[89] On February 27, the studio granted a budget of $5\u00a0million; this was later increased to $8.25\u00a0million.[5]:\u200a17:30 Subsequently, Lucas started writing with a budget in mind, conceiving the cheap, \"used\" look of much of the film, and (with Fox having just shut down its special effects department) reducing the number of complex special effects shots called for by the script.[74]\nThe third draft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled *The Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller*. This third draft had most of the elements of the final plot, with only some differences in the characters and settings. The draft characterized Luke as an only child, with his father already dead, replacing him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi.[69] This script would be re-written for the fourth and final draft, dated January 1, 1976, as *The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars*. Lucas worked with his friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to revise the fourth draft into the final pre-production script.[90]\n\n\nLucas finished writing his script in March 1976, when the crew started filming. He said, \"What finally emerged through the many drafts of the script has obviously been influenced by science-fiction and action-adventure I've read and seen. And I've seen a lot of it. I'm trying to make a classic sort of genre picture, a classic space fantasy in which all the influences are working together. There are certain traditional aspects of the genre I wanted to keep and help perpetuate in *Star Wars*.\"[50] During production, he changed Luke's name from Starkiller to Skywalker[5] and altered the title to *The Star Wars* and later *Star Wars*.[69] He would also continue to tweak the script during filming, including adding the death of Obi-Wan after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film.[91][92]\n\n\nFor the film's opening crawl, Lucas originally wrote a composition consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each.[31][93] He said, \"The crawl is such a hard thing because you have to be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem.\" Lucas showed his draft to his friends.[94] Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: \"The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish.\"[95] Lucas recounted what De Palma said the first time he saw it: \"George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you.\" De Palma and Jay Cocks helped edit the text into the form used in the film.[94][96]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n![Ralph McQuarrie in 2008](image)Ralph McQuarrie in 2008. Lucas commissioned him to create conceptual photographs for the film, which visualized the characters, costumes, props, and scenery.\nGeorge Lucas recruited many conceptual designers, including Colin Cantwell, who worked on *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), to conceptualize the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis to create the preliminary conceptual storyboard sketches of early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize the characters, costumes, props, and scenery.[50] McQuarrie's pre-production paintings of certain scenes from Lucas's early screenplay drafts helped 20th Century-Fox visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project. After McQuarrie's drawings for Lucas's colleagues Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins (who were collaborating for a film) caught his interest, Lucas met with McQuarrie to discuss his plans for the untitled space fantasy film he wanted to make. Two years later, after completing *American Graffiti*, Lucas approached McQuarrie and asked him if he would be interested \"in doing something for *Star Wars*.\"[97] McQuarrie produced a series of artworks from simple sketches; these set a visual tone for the film, and for the rest of the original trilogy.[50]\n\n\n\n> \n> *Star Wars* has no points of reference to Earth time or space, with which we are familiar, and it is not about the future but some galactic past or some extra-temporal present, it is a decidedly inhabited and used place where the hardware is taken for granted.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Lucas on his \"used future\" backdrop[98]\n\nThe film was ambitious as Lucas wanted to create fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) that had never been realized before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film *Lucky Lady* (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: \"George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real.\" They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas \"didn't want anything [in *Star Wars*] to stand out, he wanted it [to look] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'\"[99]\n\n\nLucas described a \"used future\" concept to the production designers in which all devices, ships, and buildings to do with Tatooine or the Rebels looked aged and dirty,[5][100][101] as opposed to the sleeker designs of the Empire. Lucas also wanted the spaceships to look \"cobbled together, as opposed to a sleek monoshape.\"[102] Barry said that the director \"wants to make it look like it's shot on location on your average everyday Death Star or Mos Eisley Spaceport or local cantina.\" Lucas believed that \"what is required for true credibility is a used future\", opposing the interpretation of \"future in most futurist movies\" that \"always looks new and clean and shiny.\"[98] Christian supported Lucas's vision, saying \"All science fiction before was very plastic and stupid uniforms and *Flash Gordon* stuff. Nothing was new. George was going right against that.\"[99]\n\n\nThe designers started working with the director before *Star Wars* was approved by 20th Century-Fox.[99] For four to five months, in a studio in Kensal Rise, England,[99][103] they attempted to plan the creation of the props and sets with \"no money.\" Although Lucas initially provided funds using his earnings from *American Graffiti*, it was inadequate. As they could not afford to dress the sets, Christian was forced to use unconventional methods and materials to achieve the desired look. He suggested that Lucas use scrap in making the dressings, and the director agreed.[99] Christian said, \"I've always had this idea. I used to do it with models when I was a kid. I'd stick things on them and we'd make things look old.\"[103] Barry, Christian, and their team began designing the props and sets at Elstree Studios.[98]\n\n\nAccording to Christian, the *Millennium Falcon* set was the most difficult to build. Christian wanted the interior of the *Falcon* to look like that of a submarine.[99] He found scrap airplane metal \"that no one wanted in those days and bought them.\"[103] He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to \"stick it in the sets in specific ways.\"[99] It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as \"the most encrusted set\") in the hold of the *Falcon*. The garbage compactor set \"was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around.\"[99] A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine soundstages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.[98]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars filming locations\n\nIn 1975, Lucas formed his own visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) after discovering that 20th Century-Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded. ILM began its work on *Star Wars* in a warehouse in Van Nuys. Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team, which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras.[5] The technology is now known as the Dykstraflex system.[104][105] Brian Johnson also turned down the opportunity to work on the film because he was busy working on *Space: 1999*.[106]\n\n\nLucas tried \"to get a cohesive reality\" for his feature. Since the film is a fairy tale, as he had described, \"I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an alien look.\" He designed the film to have an \"extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with strange over-exposed colors, a lot of shadows, a lot of hot areas.\" Lucas wanted *Star Wars* to embrace the combination of \"strange graphics of fantasy\" and \"the feel of a documentary\" to impress a distinct look. To achieve this, he hired the British cinematographer Gilbert Taylor.[98] Originally, Lucas's first choice for the position was Geoffrey Unsworth, who also provided the cinematography for *2001: A Space Odyssey*.[65] Unsworth was interested in working with the director, and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz. He eventually withdrew to work on the Vincente Minnelli-directed *A Matter of Time* (1976) instead, which \"really annoy[ed]\" Kurtz.[65] Lucas called up for other cinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing his choice on Taylor's cinematography for *Dr. Strangelove* and *A Hard Day's Night* (both 1964). On his decision, Lucas said: \"I thought they were good, eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor.\"[98]\n\n\nTaylor said that Lucas, who was consumed by the details of the complicated production, \"avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one, so I read the extra-long script many times and made my own decisions as to how I would shoot the picture.\" Taylor also said, \"I took it upon myself to experiment with photographing the lightsabers and other things onstage before we moved on to our two weeks of location work in Tunisia.\"[107] Taylor was aware of the \"enormous amount of process work\" to follow principal photography and believed \"a crisp result would help.\"[108]\n\n\nDuring production, Lucas and Taylor\u2014whom Kurtz called \"old-school\" and \"crotchety\"[109]\u2014had disputes over filming.[65] With a background in independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who believed that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look.[109] Kurtz stated that \"In a couple of scenes ... rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [Lucas would] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be\u2014tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment about what to do with my lights.'\"[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hotel Sidi Driss, the underground building in Matmata, Tunisia, used to film Luke's home\nOriginally, Lucas envisioned the planet of Tatooine, where much of the film would take place, as a jungle planet. Kurtz traveled to the Philippines to scout locations; however, because of the idea of spending months filming in the jungle would make Lucas \"itchy\", the director refined his vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead.[110] Kurtz then researched all American, North African, and Middle Eastern deserts, and found Tunisia, near the Sahara desert, as the ideal location.[98] Lucas later stated that he had wanted to make it look like outer space.[111]\n\n\nWhen principal photography began on March 22, 1976, in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems.[112] Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns.[112][113] Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, \"you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur.\" Given this situation, Lucas requested heavy filtration, which Taylor rejected, who said: \"I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ... But George saw it differently, so we tried using nets and other diffusion. He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300\u00a0mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together. I told him it wouldn't work, but he said that was the way he wanted to do the entire film, all diffused.\" This difference was later settled by 20th Century-Fox executives, who backed Taylor's suggestion.[114]\n\n\nFilming began in Chott el Djerid, while a construction crew in Tozeur took eight weeks to transform the desert into the desired setting.[98] Other locations included the sand dunes of the Tunisian desert near Nafta, where a scene featuring a giant skeleton of a creature lying in the background as R2-D2 and C-3PO make their way across the sands was filmed.[115] When Daniels wore the C-3PO outfit for the first time in Tunisia, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him.[113] He also could not see through his costume's eyes, which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion.[110] Abnormal radio signals caused by the Tunisian sands made the radio-controlled R2-D2 models run out of control. Baker said: \"I was incredibly grateful each time an [R2] would actually work right.\"[110] After several scenes were filmed against the volcanic canyons outside Tozeur, production moved to Matmata to film Luke's home on Tatooine. Lucas chose Hotel Sidi Driss, which is larger than the typical underground dwellings, to shoot the interior of Luke's homestead.[115] During the filming of the Jawa Sandcrawler, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who did not have good relations with Tunisia at the time, allegedly mistook the crawler as a military vehicle to be utilized against him. When Gaddafi threatened the Tunisian Government, Lucas and the Tunisian Army quickly moved his filming crew to a more discreet location.[116] Additional scenes for Tatooine were filmed at Death Valley in North America.[117]\n\n\nAfter two-and-a-half weeks of filming in Tunisia,[115] production moved to Elstree Studios, near London, to film interior scenes.[113] Elstree was chosen as a studio over other options in Hollywood or elsewhere. *Star Wars* required the use of nine different sound stages simultaneously, which most studios couldn't accommodate.[118] Because of stricter working conditions, filming in Britain had to finish by 5:30 pm, unless Lucas was in the middle of a scene.[31] He often made requests for more time to shoot, but they were usually turned down.[5]\n\n\nDespite Lucas's efforts, his crew had little interest in the film. Most of the crew considered the project a \"children's film\", rarely took their work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.[5][119] Actor Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure. Ford found it strange that \"there's a princess with weird buns in her hair\", and called Chewbacca a \"giant in a monkey suit.\"[5]\n\n\nThe Elstree sets designed by John Barry, according to Gilbert Taylor, \"were like a coal mine.\" He said that \"they were all black and gray, with really no opportunities for lighting at all.\" To resolve the problem, he worked the lighting into the sets by chopping in its walls, ceiling and floors. This would result in \"a 'cut-out' system of panel lighting\", with quartz lamps that could be placed in the holes in the walls, ceiling and floors. His idea was supported by the Fox studio, which agreed that \"we couldn't have this 'black hole of Calcutta.'\" The lighting approach Taylor devised \"allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting, which gave him more freedom.\"[114] In total, the filming in Britain took 14+1\u20442 weeks.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tikal, Guatemala, which served as the setting of the Rebel base\nLucas commissioned computer programmer Larry Cuba to create the animated Death Star plans shown at the rebel base on Yavin 4. This was written with the GRASS programming language, exported to a Vector General monitor and filmed on 35 mm to be rear-projected on the set. It is the only computer animation in the original version of the film.[120] The Yavin scenes were filmed in the Mayan temples at Tikal, Guatemala. Lucas selected the location as a potential filming site after seeing a poster of it hanging at a travel agency while he was filming in Britain. This inspired him to send a film crew to Guatemala in March 1977 to shoot scenes. While filming in Tikal, the crew paid locals with a six-pack of beer to watch over the camera equipment for several days.[121]\n\n\nWhile shooting, Lucas rarely spoke to the actors, who believed that he expected too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words \"faster\" and \"more intense\".[5] Kurtz stated that \"it happened a lot where he would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.' That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody. A lot of actors don't mind\u2014they don't care, they just get on with it. But some actors really need a lot of pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job.\" Kurtz has said that Lucas \"wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors.\"[65]\n\n\nAlec Guinness begged Lucas to kill off Obi-Wan as he didn't want to go on to speak those \"awful bloody lines\".[122]\n\n\nLadd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts.[5][113] Initially, Fox approved $8\u00a0million for the project; Gary Kurtz said: \"we proceeded to pick a production plan and do a more final budget with a British art department and look for locations in North Africa, and kind of pulled together some things. Then, it was obvious that 8\u00a0million wasn't going to do it\u2014they had approved 8\u00a0million.\" After requests from the team that \"it had to be more,\" the executives \"got a bit scared.\"[65] For two weeks, Lucas and his crew \"didn't really do anything except kind of pull together new budget figures.\" At the same time, after production fell behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. Kurtz said that \"it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that, and in the end they just said, 'Yes, that's okay, we'll go ahead.'\"[65] The crew split into three units, with those units led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor Robert Watts. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.[5][113]\n\n\nLucas had to write around a scene featuring a human Jabba the Hutt, which was scrapped due to budget and time constraints.[123] Lucas would later claim he wanted to superimpose a stop-motion creature over the actor\u2014which he did with computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 1997 Special Edition.[124][125] All of the original script drafts describe Jabba as humanoid, with the notion of him being an alien not coming up until work on the 1979 re-release.[126] According to Greedo actor Paul Blake, his own character was created as a result of Lucas having to cut the Jabba scene.[127]\n\n\nDuring production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile, as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.[5][113] Post-production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century-Fox. Moreover, Hamill's car accident left his face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.[113]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steven Spielberg said he was the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film in its early cut screening.\n*Star Wars* was originally slated for release on Christmas 1976; however, its production delays pushed the film's release to mid-1977.[128] Editor John Jympson began cutting the film together while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted, the editor was in an \"impossible position\" because Lucas had not explained any of the film's material to him. When Lucas watched Jympson's rough cut for the first time, he disliked what he saw. J.\u00a0W. Rinzler wrote that \"Jympson's selection of takes was questionable, and he seemed to be having trouble doing match-cuts.\" Lucas was prepared to give Jympson more time; Jympson disliked Lucas's working style.[129] As production went on, Lucas still disapproved of Jympson's cut and fired him halfway through the film's production. He commented: \"Unfortunately it didn't work out. It's very hard when you are hiring people to know if they are going to mesh with you and if you are going to get what you want. In the end, I don't think he fully understood the movie and what I was trying to do. I shoot in a very peculiar way, in a documentary style, and it takes a lot of hard editing to make it work.\"[130] After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced him with Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew, and his then-wife, Marcia Lucas, who was also cutting the film *New York, New York* (1977) with Lucas's friend Martin Scorsese. Richard Chew considered the film to have been cut in a slow, by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in master shots that flowed into close-up coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously.[5][131]\n\n\nJympson's original assembly contained a large amount of footage which differed from the final cut of the film, including several alternate takes and a number of scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve the narrative pace. The most significant material cut was a series of scenes from the first part of the film which introduced Luke Skywalker. These early scenes, set in Anchorhead on the planet Tatooine, presented the audience with Luke's everyday life among his friends as it is affected by the space battle above the planet; they also introduced the character of Biggs Darklighter, Luke's closest friend who departs to join the rebellion.[132] Chew explained the rationale behind removing these scenes as a narrative decision: \"In the first five minutes, we were hitting everybody with more information than they could handle. There were too many story lines to keep straight: the robots and the Princess, Vader, Luke. So we simplified it by taking out Luke and Biggs.\"[133] In an examination of this early cut, which has come to be called the \"Lost Cut\", David West Reynolds noted the film adopted a \"documentary-like\" approach that emphasized \"clarity, especially in geographic and spatial relationships\" over \"dramatic or artistic concerns\". As a result, the film was more \"leisurely paced\".[134] Reynolds estimated this early cut contained \"30\u201340%\" different footage from the final cut, with most of the differences coming from extended cuts or alternate takes rather than deleted scenes.[134]\n\n\nAfter viewing a rough cut, Alan Ladd likened the early Anchorhead scenes to \"*American Graffiti* in outer space\". Lucas was looking for a way of accelerating the storytelling, and removing Luke's early scenes would distinguish *Star Wars* from his earlier teenage drama and \"get that *American Graffiti* feel out of it\".[132] Lucas also stated that he wanted to move the narrative focus to C-3PO and R2-D2: \"At the time, to have the first half-hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea.\"[135][136]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Industrial Light & Magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.[113] With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months. Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial dogfights from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.[5]\n\n\nBurtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an \"organic soundtrack\". Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable, under tension, being struck. The lightsaber sound effect was developed by Burtt as a combination of the hum of idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum.[137] For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by bears, lions, badgers, seals, and walruses to create phrases and sentences.[138] Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone,[139] which began the idea of Vader having been a burn-victim, which had not been the case during production.[140]\n\n\nIn February 1977, Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives, several director friends, along with Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin of Marvel Comics who were preparing a *Star Wars* comic book. The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse's voice for Darth Vader. It also lacked most special effects; hand-drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams, and when the *Millennium Falcon* fought TIE fighters, the film cut to footage of World War II dogfights.[141] The reactions of the directors present, such as Brian De Palma, John Milius, and Steven Spielberg, disappointed Lucas. Spielberg, who said he was the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film, believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film; Gareth Wigan told Lucas: \"This is the greatest film I've ever seen\" and cried during the screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.[5] The delays increased the budget from $8\u00a0million to $11\u00a0million.[142]\n\n\nWith the project $2 million over budget, Lucas was forced to make numerous artistic compromises to complete *Star Wars*. Ladd reluctantly agreed to release an extra $20,000 funding and in early 1977 second unit filming completed a number of sequences including exterior desert shots for Tatooine in Death Valley and China Lake Acres in California, and exterior Yavin jungle shots in Guatemala, along with additional studio footage to complete the Mos Eisley Cantina sequence.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Original vinyl release\nOn the recommendation of Spielberg, Lucas hired John Williams, who had worked with Spielberg on the film *Jaws*, for which he won an Academy Award. Lucas originally hired Williams to consult on music editing choices and to compose the source music for the music, telling Williams that he intended to use extant music.[143][144] Lucas believed that the film would portray visually foreign worlds, but that a grand musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity. Therefore, Lucas assembled his favorite orchestral pieces for the soundtrack, until Williams convinced him that an original score would be unique and more unified, having viewed Lucas's music choices as a temp track. However, a few of Williams's eventual pieces were influenced by the temp track: the \"Main Title Theme\" was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film *Kings Row*, scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold;[145] and the track \"Dune Sea of Tatooine\" drew from the soundtrack of *Bicycle Thieves*, scored by Alessandro Cicognini. Lucas would later deny having ever conceived using extant music for the film.[143]\n\n\nIn March 1977, Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the *Star Wars* soundtrack in 12 days.[5] The original soundtrack was released as a double LP in 1977 by 20th Century Records. 20th Century Records also released *The Story of Star Wars* that year, a narrated audio drama adaptation of the film utilizing some of its original music, dialogue, and sound effects.\n\n\nThe American Film Institute's list of best film scores ranks the *Star Wars* soundtrack at number one.[146]\n\n\n\n## Cinematic and literary allusions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWar films such as *The Dam Busters* and *633 Squadron*, which used aircraft like the Avro Lancaster *(top)* and the Mosquito *(bottom)*, respectively, were inspirations for the battle sequences.\n\nAccording to Lucas, different concepts of the film were inspired by numerous sources, such as Beowulf and King Arthur for the origins of myth and religion.[5] Lucas had originally intended to remake the 1930s *Flash Gordon* film serials but was unable to obtain the rights; thus, he resorted to drawing from Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film *The Hidden Fortress* and, allegedly, Joseph Campbell's *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*.[52][147] *Star Wars* features many elements derived from *Flash Gordon*, such as the conflict between rebels and Imperial Forces, the wipes between scenes, the fusion of futuristic technology and traditional mythology, and the famous opening crawl that begins each film.[147][148] The film has also been compared to *The Wizard of Oz* (1939).[149][150]\n\n\nThe influence of *The Hidden Fortress* can be seen in the relationship between C-3PO and R2-D2, which evolved from the two bickering peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, and a Japanese family crest seen in the earlier film is similar to the Imperial Crest. *Star Wars* also borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film, *Yojimbo* (1961).[147] In both films, several men threaten the hero, bragging about how wanted they are by the authorities, and have an arm being cut off by a blade; Kuwabatake Sanjuro (played by Toshiro Mifune) is offered \"twenty-five ryo now, twenty-five when you complete the mission\", whereas Han Solo is offered \"Two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\" Its sequel *Sanjuro* (1962) also inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick featured in the film.[147] Another source of influence was *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962), which inspired the film's visual approach, including long-lens desert shots. There are also thematic parallels, including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire, and politicians who meddle behind the scenes.[147]\n\n\nTatooine is similar to the desert planet of Arrakis from Frank Herbert's *Dune* series. Arrakis is the only known source of a longevity spice; *Star Wars* makes references to spice in \"the spice mines of Kessel\", and a spice freighter. Other similarities include those between Princess Leia and Princess Alia, and Jedi mind tricks and \"The Voice\", a controlling ability used by the Bene Gesserit. In passing, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are \"moisture farmers\"; in *Dune*, dew collectors are used by Fremen to \"provide a small but reliable source of water.\"[151] Frank Herbert reported that \"David Lynch, [director of the 1984 film *Dune*] had trouble with the fact that *Star Wars* used up so much of *Dune*.\" The pair found \"sixteen points of identity\" and they calculated that \"the odds against coincidence produced a number larger than the number of stars in the universe.\"[152]\n\n\nThe Death Star assault scene was modeled after the World War II film *The Dam Busters* (1955), in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams to cripple the heavy industry of Germany's Ruhr region.[153] Some of the dialogue in *The Dam Busters* is repeated in the *Star Wars* climax; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in *The Dam Busters*. In addition, the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film *633 Squadron* (1964), directed by Walter Grauman,[154] in which RAF de Havilland Mosquitos attack a German heavy water plant by flying down a narrow fjord to drop special bombs at a precise point, while avoiding anti-aircraft guns and German fighters. Clips from both films were included in Lucas's temporary dogfight footage version of the sequence.[155] There are also similarities in the Death Star trench sequence to the bridge attack scene in *The Bridges at Toko-Ri*.[156]\n\n\nThe opening shot of *Star Wars*, in which a detailed spaceship fills the screen overhead, is a reference to the scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft *Discovery One* in Stanley Kubrick's seminal 1968 film *2001: A Space Odyssey*. The earlier big-budget science fiction film influenced the look of *Star Wars* in many other ways, including the use of EVA pods and hexagonal corridors. The Death Star has a docking bay reminiscent of the one on the orbiting space station in *2001*.[157] Although golden and male, C-3PO was inspired by the silver female robot Maria, the *Maschinenmensch* from Fritz Lang's 1927 film *Metropolis*.[158]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rendition of Dan Perri's original *Star Wars* logotype\nWhile the film was in production, a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on the titles for films such as *The Exorcist* (1973) and *Taxi Driver* (1976). Perri devised a foreshortened *STAR WARS* logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point. This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film's opening crawl. In the end, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees.[159][160]\n\n\nThe logotype eventually selected for on-screen use originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in 1976. This brochure was designed by Suzy Rice, a young art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising. On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys, Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear \"very fascist\" in style. Rice's response to her brief was to use an outlined, modified Helvetica Black. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the *S* and *T* of *STAR* and the *R* and *S* of *WARS*. Lucas signed off on the brochure in between takes while filming inserts for the Mos Eisley Cantina scene. Gary Kurtz was impressed with Rice's logo and selected it over Perri's design for the film's opening titles, after modifying the letter *W* to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice. This finalized the design of one of the most recognizable logos in cinema design, although Rice's contribution was not credited in the film.[159]\n\n\nFor the US release in 1977, 20th Century-Fox commissioned a promotional film poster from the advertising agency Smolen, Smith and Connolly. They used the freelance artist Tom Jung who was given the brief of \"good over evil.\" His poster, known as *Style 'A'*, depicted Luke Skywalker standing in a heroic pose, brandishing a shining lightsaber above his head, with Princess Leia below him, and a large, ghostly image of Darth Vader's helmet looming behind them. Some Fox executives considered this poster \"too dark\" and commissioned the Brothers Hildebrandt, a pair of well-known fantasy artists, to rework the poster for the UK release. When the film opened in British theaters, the Hildebrandts' *Style 'B'* poster was used in cinema billboards. Fox and Lucasfilm subsequently decided that they wanted to promote the new film with a less stylized and more realistic depiction of the lead characters. Producer Gary Kurtz turned to the film poster artist Tom Chantrell, who was already well known for his prolific work for Hammer horror films, and commissioned a new version. Two months after *Star Wars* opened, the Hildebrandts' poster was replaced by Chantrell's *Style 'C'* poster in UK cinemas.[161][162][163][164]\n\n\nCharles Lippincott was the marketing director for *Star Wars*. As 20th Century-Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere. He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation, and with Del Rey Books for a novelization. A fan of science fiction, he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic-Con and elsewhere within science-fiction fandom.[5][66]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### MPAA rating[edit]\n\n\nThe film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board, the votes for the rating were evenly split between G and PG. Fox requested for the film to be rated PG due to concerns that the film would be too scary for young children and due to fears that teenagers would avoid the film if it was rated G. Lucasfilm marketer, Charley Lippincott supported Fox's stance for the film to be rated PG after witnessing his 5-year-old child being upset with a scene in which Darth Vader chokes Captain Antilles. One of Lippincott's friends worked at the rating board and she agreed with his stance. The board reneged and gave the film a PG rating.[165]\n\n\n\n### First public screening[edit]\n\n\nOn May 1, 1977, the first public screening was held at Northpoint Theatre[166][167][*failed verification*][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] in San Francisco, where *American Graffiti* was test-screened, four years earlier.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Premiere and initial release[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A crowd outside Leicester Square Theatre in London, the day after the film's premiere\nWorried that *Star Wars* would be beaten out by other summer films, such as *Smokey and the Bandit*, 20th Century-Fox moved the release date to May 25, the Wednesday before Memorial Day. However, only 37 theaters ordered the film to be shown in North America. In response, the studio demanded that theaters order *Star Wars* if they wanted the eagerly anticipated *The Other Side of Midnight* based on Sidney Sheldon's 1973 novel by the same name.[5]\n\n\n*Star Wars* debuted on Wednesday, May 25, 1977, in fewer than 32 theaters, and eight more on Thursday and Friday. Kurtz said in 2002, \"That would be laughable today.\" It immediately broke box office records, effectively becoming one of the first blockbuster films, and Fox accelerated plans to broaden its release.[66][170] Lucas himself was not able to predict how successful *Star Wars* would be. After visiting the set of the Steven Spielberg film *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, Lucas was sure *Close Encounters* would outperform the yet-to-be-released *Star Wars* at the box office. Spielberg disagreed, and believed *Star Wars* would be the bigger hit. Lucas proposed they trade 2.5% of the profit on each other's films; Spielberg took the trade, and still receives 2.5% of the profits from *Star Wars*.[171]\n\n\nAmidst Fox pessimism, Lucas elected to forgo his option to an extra $500,000 fee for directing *Star Wars*, in exchange for obtaining the merchandising and sequel rights for the movie from Fox.[172]\n*The Other Side of Midnight* was supposed to be the studio's big summer hit, while Lucas's movie was considered the \"B track\" for theater owners nationwide. While Fox requested Mann's Chinese Theatre, the studio promised that the film needed only two weeks.[173] Fearing that the film would fail, Lucas had made plans to be in Hawaii with his wife Marcia. Having forgotten that the film would open that day,[174] he spent most of Wednesday in a sound studio in Los Angeles. When Lucas went out for lunch with Marcia, they encountered a long line of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann's Chinese Theatre, waiting to see *Star Wars*.[113] He was still skeptical of the film's success, even with enthusiastic reports from Ladd and the studio. While in Hawaii, it was not until he watched Walter Cronkite discuss the gigantic crowds for *Star Wars* on *CBS Evening News* that Lucas realized he had become very wealthy. Francis Ford Coppola, who needed money to finish *Apocalypse Now*, sent a telegram to Lucas's hotel asking for funding.[174] Even technical crew members, such as model makers, were asked for autographs, and cast members became instant household names;[5] when Ford visited a record store to buy an album, enthusiastic fans tore half his shirt off.[174]\n\n\n\n> \n> On opening day I ... did a radio call-in show ... this caller, was really enthusiastic and talking about the movie in really deep detail. I said, 'You know a lot about the film.' He said, 'Yeah, yeah, I've seen it four times already.'\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Producer Gary Kurtz, on when he realized *Star Wars* had become a cultural phenomenon[175]\n\nThe film was a huge success for 20th Century-Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price had doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century-Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.[5]\n\n\nAlthough the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Ladd became anxious during the premiere in Japan. After the screening, the audience was silent, leading him to fear that the film would be unsuccessful. Ladd was reassured by his local contacts that this was a positive reaction considering that in Japan, silence was the greatest honor to a film, and the subsequent strong box office returns confirmed its popularity.[5]\n\n\nAfter two weeks William Friedkin's *Sorcerer* replaced *Star Wars* at Mann's Chinese Theatre because of contractual obligations; Mann Theatres moved the film to a less-prestigious location after quickly renovating it.[173] When *Star Wars* made an unprecedented second opening at Mann's Chinese Theatre on August 3, 1977, after *Sorcerer* failed, thousands of people attended a ceremony in which C-3PO, R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater's forecourt.[170][5] At that time *Star Wars* was playing in 1,096 theaters in the United States.[176] Approximately 60 theaters played the film continuously for over a year;[177] in 1978, Lucasfilm distributed \"Birthday Cake\" posters to those theaters for special events on May 25, the one-year anniversary of the film's release.[178] *Star Wars* premiered in the UK on December 27, 1977. News reports of the film's popularity in America caused long lines to form at the two London theaters that first offered the film; it became available in 12 large cities in January 1978, and other London theaters in February.[179]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars* remains one of the most financially successful films of all time. The film opened on a Wednesday in 32 theaters expanding to 43 screens on the Friday and earning $2,556,418 in its first six days to the end of the Memorial Day weekend[180] ($12.9\u00a0million in 2023 dollars). Per *Variety*'s weekly box office charts, the film was number one at the US box office for its first three weeks. It was replaced by *The Deep* but gradually added screens and returned to number one in its seventh week, building up to $7 million weekends as it entered wide release ($35.2\u00a0million in 2023 dollars)[3] and remained number one for the next 15 weeks. It replaced *Jaws* as the highest-earning film in North America just six months into release,[181] eventually earning over $220 million during its initial theatrical run ($1.11\u00a0billion in 2023 dollars).[182] *Star Wars* entered international release towards the end of the year, and in 1978 added the worldwide record to its domestic one,[183] earning $410 million in total.[184] Its biggest international market was Japan, where it grossed $58.4 million.[185]\n\n\nOn July 21, 1978, while still in current release in 38 theaters in the U.S., the film expanded into a 1,744 theater national saturation windup of release and set a new U.S. weekend record of $10,202,726.[186][187][188] The gross prior to the expansion was $221,280,994. The expansion added a further $43,774,911 to take its gross to $265,055,905. Reissues in 1979 ($22,455,262), 1981 ($17,247,363), and 1982 ($17,981,612) brought its cumulative gross in the U.S. and Canada to $323 million,[189][190] and extended its global earnings to $530 million.[191] In doing so, it became the first film to gross $500 million worldwide,[192] and remained the highest-grossing film of all time until *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* broke that record in 1983.[193]\n\n\nThe release of the Special Edition in 1997 was the highest-grossing reissue of all-time with a gross of $138.3 million, bringing its total gross in the United States and Canada to $460,998,007, reclaiming the all-time number one spot.[194][3][195][196] Internationally, the reissue grossed $117.2 million, with $26 million from the United Kingdom and $15 million from Japan.[185] In total, the film has grossed over $775 million worldwide.[3]\n\n\nAdjusted for inflation, it had earned over $2.5 billion worldwide at 2011 prices,[197] which saw it ranked as the third-highest-grossing film at the time, according to *Guinness World Records*.[198] At the North American box office, it ranks second behind *Gone with the Wind* on the inflation-adjusted list.[199]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n> \n> What makes the *Star Wars* experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It's usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie\u2014violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark's jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there's hardly any violence at all in *Star Wars* (and even then it's presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there's entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Roger Ebert, in his review for the *Chicago Sun-Times*[200]\n\n*Star Wars* received critical acclaim. In his 1977 review, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film \"an out-of-body experience\", compared its special effects to those of *2001: A Space Odyssey*, and opined that the true strength of the film was its \"pure narrative\".[200] Vincent Canby of *The New York Times* called the film \"the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure\" and \"the most elaborate, most expensive, most beautiful movie serial ever made\".[201] A.D. Murphy of *Variety* described the film as \"magnificent\" and said George Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the \"biggest possible adventure fantasy\" based on the serials and older action epics from his childhood.[202] Writing for *The Washington Post*, Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review, writing that the film \"is a new classic in a rousing movie tradition: a space swashbuckler.\"[203] However, the film was not without its detractors: Pauline Kael of *The New Yorker* criticized *Star Wars*, stating that \"there's no breather in the picture, no lyricism\", and that it had no \"emotional grip\".[204] John Simon of *New York* magazine also panned the film and wrote, \"Strip *Star Wars* of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality.\"[205] Stanley Kauffmann, reviewing the film in *The New Republic*, opined that it \"was made for those (particularly males) who carry a portable shrine within them of their adolescence, a chalice of a Self that was Better Then, before the world's affairs or\u2014in any complex way\u2014sex intruded.\"[206]\n\n\nWhen *Star Wars* opened in the UK, Derek Malcolm of *The Guardian* concluded that it \"plays enough games to satisfy the most sophisticated\", though he stated that Lucas's earlier films were better.[207] Barry Norman of *Film...* called the movie \"family entertainment at its most sublime\", which \"combines all the best-loved themes of romantic adventure\", with a script evoking \"everyone's glorious memories of Saturday matinees\".[208] *The Daily Telegraph*'s science correspondent Adrian Berry said that *Star Wars* \"is the best such film since *2001* and in certain respects it is one of the most exciting ever made\". He described the plot as \"unpretentious and pleasantly devoid of any 'message'.\"[209] A few critics found fault in the film's lack of representation of African Americans.[c][d] Lucas was taken aback by some of the criticisms, while Lippincott stated, \"We have barely dug into this galaxy and what it's like.\"[213]\n\n\nGene Siskel, writing for the *Chicago Tribune* in 1977, said, \"What places it a sizable cut above the routine is its spectacular visual effects, the best since Stanley Kubrick's *2001*.\"[214][215] Andrew Collins of *Empire* magazine awarded the film five out of five and said, \"*Star Wars*' timeless appeal lies in its easily identified, universal archetypes\u2014goodies to root for, baddies to boo, a princess to be rescued and so on\u2014and if it is most obviously dated to the 70s by the special effects, so be it.\"[216] In his 1977 review, Robert Hatch of *The Nation* called the film \"an outrageously successful, what will be called a 'classic,' compilation of nonsense, largely derived but thoroughly reconditioned. I doubt that anyone will ever match it, though the imitations must already be on the drawing boards.\"[217] In a more critical review, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the *Chicago Reader* stated, \"None of these characters has any depth, and they're all treated like the fanciful props and settings.\"[218] Peter Keough of the *Boston Phoenix* said, \"*Star Wars* is a junkyard of cinematic gimcracks not unlike the Jawas' heap of purloined, discarded, barely functioning droids.\"[219]\n\n\nThe film continues to receive critical acclaim from modern critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 137 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same.\"[220] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[221] In his 1997 review of the film's 20th anniversary release, Michael Wilmington of the *Chicago Tribune* gave the film four out of four stars, saying, \"A grandiose and violent epic with a simple and whimsical heart.\"[222] A *San Francisco Chronicle* staff member described the film as \"a thrilling experience\".[223] In 2001 Matt Ford of the BBC awarded the film five out of five stars and wrote, \"*Star Wars* isn't the best film ever made, but it is universally loved.\"[224] CinemaScore reported that audiences for *Star Wars*'s 1999 re-release gave the film a \"A+\" grade.[225]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nThe film garnered numerous accolades after its release. *Star Wars* won six competitive Academy Awards at the 50th Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. A Special Achievement for Sound Effects Editing went to sound designer Ben Burtt[226] and a Scientific and Engineering Award went to John Dykstra for the development of the Dykstraflex Camera (shared with Alvah J. Miller and Jerry Jeffress, who were both granted for the engineering of the Electronic Motion Control System).[227] Additional nominations included Alec Guinness for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, which went to Jason Robards for *Julia* and George Lucas for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, which were instead awarded to Woody Allen's *Annie Hall*.[226]\n\n\nAt the 35th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Alec Guinness), and it won the award for Best Score.[228] It received six British Academy Film Awards nominations: Best Film, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Production/Art Design, Best Sound, and Best Score; the film won in the latter two categories.[229] John Williams's soundtrack album won the Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score for a Motion Picture or Television Program,[230] and the film attained the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[231]\n\n\nThe film also received twelve nominations at the Saturn Awards, winning nine: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction and Best Writing for George Lucas, Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness, Best Music for John Williams, Best Costume for John Mollo, Best Make-up for Rick Baker and Stuart Freeborn, Best Special Effects for John Stears, John Dykstra, and Outstanding Editing for Paul Hirsch, Marcia Lucas and Richard Chew.[232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Composer John Williams received the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award and Saturn Award for the soundtrack of *Star Wars.*\n![](image)Filmmaker George Lucas received the directing (Academy Award, Directors Guild of America Award, Golden Globe Award, and Saturn Award) and writing (Academy Award, Saturn Award, and Writers Guild of America Award) nominations for *Star Wars.*\n\n\n| Organization\n | Category\n | Nominee\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | Best Picture | Gary Kurtz | Nominated\n |\n| Best Director | George Lucas | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor | Alec Guinness | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Screenplay | George Lucas | Nominated\n |\n| Best Art Direction | John Barry, Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley and Roger Christian | Won\n |\n| Best Costume Design | John Mollo | Won\n |\n| Best Film Editing | Paul Hirsch, Marcia Lucas and Richard Chew | Won\n |\n| Best Original Score | John Williams | Won\n |\n| Best Sound | Don MacDougall, Ray West, Bob Minkler and Derek Ball | Won\n |\n| Best Visual Effects | John Stears, John Dykstra, Richard Edlund, Grant McCune and Robert Blalack | Won\n |\n| Special Achievement Academy Award | Ben Burtt | Won\n |\n| American Music Awards | Favorite Pop/Rock Album | John Williams | Nominated\n |\n| British Academy Film Awards | Best Film | Gary Kurtz | Nominated\n |\n| Best Costume Design | John Mollo | Nominated\n |\n| Best Editing | Paul Hirsch, Marcia Lucas and Richard Chew | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Music | John Williams | Won\n |\n| Best Production Design | John Barry | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound | Sam Shaw, Robert Rutledge, Gordon Davidson, Gene Corso, Derek Ball, Don MacDougall, Bob Minkler, Ray West, Michael Minkler, Les Fresholtz, Richard Portman and Ben Burtt | Won\n |\n| Directors Guild of America Awards | Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film | George Lucas | Nominated\n |\n| Golden Globe Awards | Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama | Gary Kurtz | Nominated\n |\n| Best Director | George Lucas | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture | Alec Guinness | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Score | John Williams | Won\n |\n| Saturn Awards | Best Science Fiction Film | Gary Kurtz | Won\n |\n| Best Director | George Lucas | Won\n |\n| Best Actor | Harrison Ford | Nominated\n |\n| Mark Hamill | Nominated\n |\n| Best Actress | Carrie Fisher | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor | Alec Guinness | Won\n |\n| Peter Cushing | Nominated\n |\n| Best Writing | George Lucas | Won\n |\n| Best Costume Design | John Mollo | Won\n |\n| Best Make-up | Rick Baker and Stuart Freeborn | Won\n |\n| Best Music | John Williams | Won\n |\n| Best Special Effects | John Dykstra and John Stears | Won\n |\n| Best Art Direction\n | Norman Reynolds and Leslie Dilley | Won\n |\n| Best Cinematography\n | Gilbert Taylor | Won\n |\n| Best Editing\n | Paul Hirsch, Marcia Lucas and Richard Chew | Won\n |\n| Best Set Decoration\n | Roger Christian | Won\n |\n| Best Sound\n | Ben Burtt and Don MacDougall | Won\n |\n| Writers Guild of America Awards | Best Original Screenplay | George Lucas | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical re-releases[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Changes in Star Wars re-releases\n\n![](image)The introductory graphics for the film feature Suzy Rice's *Star Wars* logotype; the film's cinematic re-release in 1981 added *Episode IV* and *A New Hope* to the head of the opening crawl.\n*Star Wars* was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982,[233] with the subtitles *Episode IV* and *A New Hope* being added in 1981. Kurtz said that Lucas and his creative team had been planning on renaming '*Star Wars*' since *Empire*'s production.[234] The film was digitally remastered with some altered scenes in 1997 for a theatrical re-release, dubbed the \"Special Edition\". Since its original release, the film has also been dubbed and subtitled into numerous languages. In 2010, Lucas announced that all six previously released *Star Wars* films would be scanned and transferred to 3D for a theatrical release, but only 3D versions of the prequel trilogy were completed before the franchise was sold to Disney in 2012.[235] In 2013, *Star Wars* was dubbed into Navajo, making it the first major motion picture translated into a Native American language.[236][237]\n\n\nThe subtitles *Episode IV* and *A New Hope* were first published on a title page for the film's script in the 1979 book *The Art of Star Wars*,[e] in what Kaminski claims as \"outright forgery\", remarking that \"the script itself wasn't even the authentic revised fourth draft, but more like a transcription of the finished film, edited and combined with the real fourth draft.\"[239] The title was changed when the film entered re-releases.[31][240] Official sources state that the change was made at the theatrical re-release of April 10, 1981.[241][242][f]\n\n\nThe retronymic inclusion of subtitles brought the film into line with the introduction to its sequel, *The Empire Strikes Back*, which was reconceived during rewrites as \"Episode V\" and eventually released as such in 1980.[243][244] Lucas claims this was intended from the beginning, and was only dropped to avoid confusing audiences: \"*Star Wars* was the fourth story in the saga and was to have been called '*Star Wars, Episode Four: A New Hope*'.\"[245] In 2014, Kurtz recalled they had toyed with the idea \"of calling it Episode III, IV, or V.\"[246][g] Hamill recalls having asked Lucas \"Why are we doing episode four?\" and being answered that Lucas wanted \"to give the audience a feeling that they'd missed something and that they were coming into the middle of this story\"[250] or that it was \"the most commercial section\" of the overriding story.[88] Kaminski, however, points out that all early drafts carry an \"Episode One\" subtitle, and that even early drafts of the sequel are called \"Episode II\".[88]\n\n\n\n#### Special Edition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 20th-anniversary theatrical release poster of the 1997 Special Edition featured art by Drew Struzan.\nAfter ILM began to create CGI for Steven Spielberg's 1993 film *Jurassic Park*, Lucas decided that digital technology had caught up to his \"original vision\" for *Star Wars*.[5] For the film's 20th anniversary in 1997, *Star Wars* was digitally remastered with some altered scenes and re-released to theaters, along with *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi*, under the campaign title *Star Wars* Trilogy: Special Edition. This version of the film runs 124 minutes.\n\n\nThe Special Edition contains visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original due to financial, technological, and time constraints; one such scene involves a meeting between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt.[5] The process of creating the new visual effects for *Star Wars* was featured in the documentary film *Special Effects: Anything Can Happen*, directed by *Star Wars* sound designer Ben Burtt.[251] Although most changes are minor or cosmetic in nature, many fans and critics believe that Lucas degraded the film with the additions.[252][253][254] A particularly controversial change in which a bounty hunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T-shirts bearing the phrase \"Han Shot First\".[255][256][257]\n\n\n*Star Wars* required extensive recovery of misplaced footage and restoration of the whole film before Lucas's Special Edition modifications could be attempted. It was discovered that in addition to the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films, Lucas had also used Color Reversal Internegative (CRI) film, a reversal stock subsequently discontinued by Kodak. CRI proved to deteriorate faster than negative stocks did, although it theoretically was of higher quality, as it saved two generations (an interpositive followed by an internegative), where employed. Because of this, the entire composited negative had to be disassembled, and the CRI portions cleaned separately from the negative portions. Once the cleaning was complete, the film was scanned into the computer for restoration. In many cases, entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements. Digital compositing technology allowed the restorers to correct for problems such as misalignment of mattes and \"blue-spill\".[258]\n\n\nIn 1989, the 1977 theatrical version of *Star Wars* was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress.[259] 35\u00a0mm reels of the 1997 Special Edition were initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,[260] but it was later revealed that the Library possessed a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical release. By 2015, this copy had been transferred to a 2K scan, now available to be viewed by appointment.[261]\n\n\nShortly after the release of *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,* it was reported that both director Gareth Edwards and J. J. Abrams had seen a 4K restoration of the theatrical version done by Disney themselves. The existence of this restoration has, however, never been officially confirmed by Disney, and in later interviews, Abrams has expressed doubts that any of the original trilogy would be released in their theatrical versions. He has, however, publicly stated that he would definitely like to see them made available again.[262]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan, parts of or the whole film were released on Super 8.[263] The whole film was released for all these countries (including subtitled silent editions and an American Spanish-language edition), except for Italy, where the film (titled \"*Guerre stellari*\") was released by IE International as eight brief scenes: *Battaglia spaziale* (\"Space battle\", the Battle of Yavin), *Duello col laser* (\"Duel with the laser\",[h] Obi-Wan and Darth Vader's duel), *La cattura dell'astronave* (\"The capture of the spaceship\"), *La liberazione di Leia* (\"Leia's liberation\", the adventure on the Death Star), *Messaggio dallo spazio* (\"Message from space\", Leia giving R2-D2 the plans), *SOS nella galassia* (\"SOS in the galaxy\"), and *Trappola mortale* (\"Deadly trap\", the *Falcon* being captured by the Death Star). A full Super 8 version of the film was only made available in Italy as a pirate six-reel set.[264]\n\n\nClips were also released for the Movie Viewer toy projector by Kenner Products[265] in cassettes featuring very short scenes, including *Assault on Death Star*, *Battle in Hyperspace*, *Danger at the Cantina*, and *Destroy Death Star*.[266]\n\n\n*Star Wars* debuted on Betamax,[267] CED,[268] LaserDisc,[269] Video 2000, and VHS[270][271] between the 1980s and 1990s by CBS/Fox Video. The final issue of the original theatrical release (pre-Special Edition) to VHS format occurred in 1995, as part of \"Last Chance to Own the Original\" campaign, available as part of a trilogy set and as a standalone purchase.[272] The film was released for the first time on DVD on September 21, 2004, in a box set with *The Empire Strikes Back*, *Return of the Jedi*, and a bonus disc of supplementary material. The films were digitally restored and remastered, and more changes were made by Lucas. The DVD features a commentary track from Lucas, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher. The bonus disc contains the documentary *Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy*, three featurettes, teasers, theatrical trailers, TV spots, still galleries, an exclusive preview of *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*, a playable Xbox demo of the LucasArts game *Star Wars: Battlefront*, and a making-of documentary on the *Episode III* video game.[273] The set was reissued in December 2005 as part of a three-disc limited edition boxed set without the bonus disc.[274]\n\n\nThe trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc limited edition DVD sets from September 12 to December 31, 2006, and again in a limited edition tin box set on November 4, 2008;[275] the original versions of the films were added as bonus material. The release was met with criticism as the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non-anamorphic LaserDisc masters and were not re-transferred using modern video standards. The transfer led to problems with colors and digital image jarring.[276]\n\n\nAll six *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011, in three different editions, with *A New Hope* available in both a box set of the original trilogy[277][278] and with all six films on *Star Wars: The Complete Saga*, which includes nine discs and over 40 hours of special features.[279] The original theatrical versions of the films were not included in the box set. New changes were made to the films, provoking mixed responses.[280]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. Fox released *A New Hope* for digital download on April 10, 2015.[i][281][282] In December 2016, *Rogue One* (2016) director Gareth Edwards revealed that Lucasfilm had recently completed a 4K restoration of *Star Wars*, but did not elaborate on whether the restored version was based on the 1977 original or a subsequent re-release.[283]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on September 22, 2019.[284] Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.[285] This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.[286]\n\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kenner Star Wars action figures, Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker, and Star Wars comics\n\nLittle *Star Wars* merchandise was available for several months after the film's debut, as only Kenner Products had accepted marketing director Charles Lippincott's licensing offers. Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its \"empty box\" Christmas campaign. Television commercials told children and parents that vouchers within a \"Star Wars Early Bird Certificate Package\" could be redeemed for four action figures between February and June 1978.[5] Jay West of the *Los Angeles Times* said that the boxes in the campaign \"became the most coveted empty box[es] in the history of retail.\"[287] In 2012, the *Star Wars* action figures were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.[288]\n\n\nThe novelization of the film was published as *Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker* in December 1976, six months before the film was released. The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster. Marketing director Charles Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November 1976. By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold.[5] Foster also wrote the sequel novel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* (1978) to be adapted as a low-budget film if *Star Wars* was not a financial success.[289]\n\n\nMarvel Comics also adapted the film as the first six issues of its licensed *Star Wars* comic book, with the first issue sold in April 1977. Roy Thomas was the writer and Howard Chaykin was the artist of the adaptation. Like the novelization, it contained certain elements, such as the scene with Luke and Biggs, that appeared in the screenplay but not in the finished film.[141] The series was so successful that, according to Jim Shooter, it \"single-handedly saved Marvel\".[290] From January to April 1997, Dark Horse Comics, which held the comic rights to *Star Wars* since 1991, published a comic book adaptation of the \"Special Edition\" of the film, written by Bruce Jones with art by Eduardo Barreto and Al Williamson; 36 years later, the same company published *The Star Wars*, an adaptation of the plot from Lucas' original rough draft screenplay, from September 2013 to May 2014.[291]\n\n\nLucasfilm adapted the story for a children's book-and-record set. Released in 1979, the 24-page *Star Wars* read-along book was accompanied by a 33\u2153\u00a0rpm 7-inch phonograph record. Each page of the book contained a cropped frame from the movie with an abridged and condensed version of the story. The record was produced by Buena Vista Records, and its content was copyrighted by Black Falcon, Ltd., a subsidiary of Lucasfilm \"formed to handle the merchandising for *Star Wars*.\"[292] *The Story of Star Wars* was a 1977 record album presenting an abridged version of the events depicted in *Star Wars*, using dialogue and sound effects from the original film. The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston, and was narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne. The script was adapted by E. Jack Kaplan and Cheryl Gard.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAn audio CD boxed set of the *Star Wars* radio series was released in 1993, containing the original 1981 radio drama along with the radio adaptations of the sequels, *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi*.[293]\n\n\n\n## Legacy and influence[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars* launched the careers of many of its actors, including Hamill, Ford, Fisher, Mayhew, Daniels, Baker, and Jones.[5] Ford, who subsequently starred in the *Indiana Jones* series (1981\u20132023), *Blade Runner* (1982), and *Witness* (1985) after working on the film, told the *Daily Mirror* that *Star Wars* \"boosted my career\", and said, \"I think the great luck of my career is that I've made these family movies which are introduced to succeeding generations of kids by their families at the time it seems appropriate.\"[294]\n\n\nThe film also spawned the *Star Wars Holiday Special*, which debuted on CBS on November 17, 1978, and is often considered a failure; Lucas himself disowned it.[295] The special has never been aired after its original broadcast, and it has never been officially released on home video. However, many bootleg copies exist, and the special has consequently become something of an underground legend.[296]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\n*Star Wars* and its ensuing film installments have been explicitly referenced and satirized across a wide range of media. *Hardware Wars*, released in 1978, was one of the first fan films to parody *Star Wars*.[297] It received positive critical reaction, went to earn over $1\u00a0million, and is one of Lucas's favorite *Star Wars* spoofs.[298][299][300] Writing for *The New York Times*, Frank DeCaro said, \"*Star Wars* littered pop culture of the late 1970s with a galaxy of space junk.\"[301] He cited *Quark* (a short-lived 1977 sitcom that parodies the science fiction genre)[301] and *Donny & Marie* (a 1970s variety show that produced a 10-minute musical adaptation of *Star Wars* guest starring Daniels and Mayhew)[302] as \"television's two most infamous examples.\"[301] Mel Brooks's *Spaceballs*, a satirical comic science fiction parody, was released in 1987 to mixed reviews.[303] Lucas permitted Brooks to make a spoof of the film under \"one incredibly big restriction: no action figures.\"[304] In the 1990s and 2000s, animated comedy TV series *Family Guy*,[305] *Robot Chicken*,[306] and *The Simpsons*[307] have produced episodes satirizing the film series. A Nerdist article published in 2021 argues that \"*Star Wars* is the most influential film of all time\" partly on the basis that \"if all copies ... suddenly vanished, we could more or less recreate the film ... using other media,\" including parodies.[308]\n\n\n*Star Wars*, together with Lucas, is the subject of the 2010 documentary film *The People vs. George Lucas* that details the issues of filmmaking and fanaticism pertaining to the film franchise and its creator.[309] Many elements of the film are prominent in popular culture. The weapon of choice of the Jedi, the lightsaber, was voted as the most popular weapon in film history in a survey of approximately 2,000 film fans.[310] Characters such as Darth Vader, Han Solo, and Yoda are enduringly popular, and all three were named in the top twenty of the British Film Institute's \"Best Sci-Fi Characters of All-Time\" list.[311] The expressions \"Evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon.[312] A pun on the latter phrase has led to May 4 being regarded by many fans of the franchise as an unofficial *Star Wars* Day.[313] To commemorate the film's 30th anniversary in May 2007, the United States Postal Service issued a set of 15 stamps depicting the characters of the franchise. Approximately 400 mailboxes across the country were also designed to look like R2-D2.[314]\n\n\n\n### Cinematic influence[edit]\n\n\nEbert wrote in his book *The Great Movies*, \"Like *The Birth of a Nation* and *Citizen Kane*, *Star Wars* was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.\" It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.[100] Along with Steven Spielberg's *Jaws*, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.[5][315][316]\n\n\nFilmmakers who have said to have been influenced by *Star Wars* include James Cameron, J. J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Gareth Edwards,[317] Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter,[318] David Fincher, Peter Jackson, Joss Whedon, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, John Singleton, and Kevin Smith.[100] Scott, Cameron, and Jackson were influenced by Lucas's concept of the \"used future\" (where vehicles and culture are obviously dated) and extended the concept for their films, such as Scott's science fiction films *Alien* (1979) and *Blade Runner* (1982), Cameron's acclaimed sequel *Aliens* (1986) and his earlier breakthrough film *The Terminator* (1984). Jackson used the concept for his production of *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy to add a sense of realism and believability.[100] Christopher Nolan cited *Star Wars* as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film, *Inception*.[319]\n\n\nSome critics have blamed *Star Wars*, as well as *Jaws*, for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from \"sophisticated\" films such as *The Godfather*, *Taxi Driver*, and *Annie Hall* to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy.[320] On a late 1977 episode of *Sneak Previews*, Siskel expressed concern that, \"It's so successful and so mindless fun that I hope Hollywood doesn't forget that there are people who like to see serious pictures too.\"[321] Another critic, Peter Biskind, later complained, \"When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.\"[320][174] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through *Star Wars* and *Jaws*, Lucas and Spielberg \"didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect\", which was \"a kind of rebirth.\"[316]\n\n\n\n### Recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn its May 30, 1977, issue, *Time* magazine named *Star Wars* the \"Movie of the Year\". The publication said it was a \"big early supporter\" of the vision which would become *Star Wars*. In an article intended for the cover of the issue, *Time*'s Gerald Clarke wrote that *Star Wars* is \"a grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far. The result is a remarkable confection: a subliminal history of the movies, wrapped in a riveting tale of suspense and adventure, ornamented with some of the most ingenious special effects ever contrived for film.\" Each of the subsequent films of the *Star Wars* saga has appeared on the magazine's cover.[322]\n\n\n\nAFI 100 Years... series\n\n\n> \n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (1998)\u00a0\u2013 #15[323]\n> \n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills (2001)\u00a0\u2013 #27[324]\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains (2003):\n> \t+ Han Solo\u00a0\u2013 #14 Hero[325]\n> \t+ Obi-Wan Kenobi\u00a0\u2013 #37 Hero[325]\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2004):\n> \t+ \"May the Force be with you.\"\u00a0\u2013 #8[326]\n> * AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores (2005)\u00a0\u2013 #1[146]\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers (2006)\u00a0\u2013 #39[327]\n> * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) (2007)\u00a0\u2013 #13[328]\n> * AFI's 10 Top 10 (2008)\u00a0\u2013 #2 Sci-Fi Film[329]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAmerican Film Institute[330]\n\n*Star Wars* was voted the second most popular film by Americans in a 2008 nationwide poll conducted by the market research firm, Harris Interactive.[331] *Star Wars* has also been featured in several high-profile audience polls: in 1997, it ranked as the 10th Greatest American Film on the *Los Angeles Daily News* Readers' Poll;[332] in 2002, the film and its sequel *The Empire Strikes Back* were voted as the greatest films ever made in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Films poll;[333] in 2011, it ranked as Best Sci-Fi Film on *Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time*, a primetime special aired by ABC that counted down the best films as chosen by fans, based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and *People* magazine; in 2014 the film placed 11th in a poll undertaken by *The Hollywood Reporter*, which balloted every studio, agency, publicity firm, and production house in the Hollywood region.[334]\n\n\nReputable publications also have included *Star Wars* in their best films lists: in 2008, *Empire* magazine ranked *Star Wars* at No. 22 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\";[335] in 2010, the film ranked among the \"All-Time 100\" list of the greatest films as chosen by *Time* magazine film critic Richard Schickel;[336] the film was also placed on a similar list created by *The New York Times*, \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\";[337] in 2012, the film was included in *Sight & Sound*'s prestigious decennial critics poll \"Critics' Top 250 Films\", ranking at 171st on the list, and in their directors poll at 224th.[338]\n\n\nLucas's original screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 68th greatest of all time.[339] In 1989, the United States Library of Congress named *Star Wars* among its first selections to the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"; at the time, it was the most recent film to be selected and it was the only film from the 1970s to be chosen.[259] Although Lucas declined to provide the Library with a workable copy of the original film upon request (instead offering the Special Edition), a viewable scan was made of the original copyright deposit print.[260][261] In 1991, *Star Wars* was one of the first 25 films inducted into the Producers Guild of America's Hall of Fame for setting \"an enduring standard for American entertainment.\"[340] The soundtrack was added to the United States National Recording Registry 15 years later (in 2004).[341] The lack of a commercially available version of the 1977 original theatrical edit of the film since early '80s VHS releases has spawned numerous restorations by disgruntled fans over the years, such as Harmy's Despecialized Edition.[342]\n\n\nIn addition to the film's multiple awards and nominations, *Star Wars* has also been recognized by the American Film Institute on several of its lists. The film ranks first on 100 Years of Film Scores,[146] second on Top 10 Sci-Fi Films,[329] 15th on 100 Years...100 Movies[323] (ranked 13th on the updated 10th anniversary edition),[328] 27th on 100 Years...100 Thrills,[324] and 39th on 100 Years...100 Cheers.[327] In addition, the quote \"May the Force be with you\" is ranked eighth on 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes,[326] and Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked as the 14th and 37th greatest heroes respectively on 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains.[325]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations, sequels, and prequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Star Wars *franchise*, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, Star Wars prequel trilogy, and Star Wars sequel trilogy\n\nA radio drama adaptation of the film was broadcast on the American National Public Radio network in 1981. The adaptation was written by Brian Daley and directed by John Madden, and was produced with cooperation from George Lucas, who donated the rights to NPR. Williams's music and Burtt's sound design were retained for the show, and Hamill and Daniels reprised their roles.[343] The radio drama narrative began with a version of the backstory to the film, which relates Princess Leia's acquisition of the secret Death Star plans. It also featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film, such as Luke Skywalker's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars, a skyhopper race, and Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia. The radio version was originally considered to be part of the official *Star Wars* canon,[344][345] but has since been supplanted by revised canonical narratives.[346]\n\n\n*Star Wars* was followed by *The Empire Strikes Back* in 1980[347] and *Return of the Jedi* in 1983, which concludes the original film trilogy.[348] *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi* continue the backstory of the original trilogy.[348][349] Like the previous film, *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi* were a financial success and fared well with critics,[348][350] as the original trilogy is considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[351]\n\n\n22 years after the release of *Star Wars*, Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy, consisting of the films *The Phantom Menace* (1999), *Attack of the Clones* (2002), and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005). The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter's fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. The prequel trilogy was financially successful, and polarized critics and fans on their release for the storylines and some new characters.[352][353][354][355][356] After Lucas sold the *Star Wars* franchise to The Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney developed a sequel trilogy, consisting of *The Force Awakens* (2015), *The Last Jedi* (2017), and *The Rise of Skywalker* (2019).[357][358][359][360][361] Original trilogy cast including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher reprised their roles, alongside new characters portrayed by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac.[362] Standalone films and television series have also been released, exploring adventures set around the main trilogy arcs.[363][364][365][366]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also reportedly considered were Kathleen Turner, Sigourney Weaver, Meryl Streep, Kim Basinger, Glenn Close, Jane Seymour, Cybill Shepherd, Jessica Lange, Geena Davis, Anjelica Huston, Sissy Spacek, and Farrah Fawcett.[25]\n2. **^** Lucas's claims are internally inconsistent, and have been refuted by Kurtz, Kaminski,[73] and Chris Taylor.[74] Lucas sometimes admitted to have only had notes rather than complete treatments or scripts, and in 2010 confided to the showrunners of *Lost* that: \"when *Star Wars* first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance.\"[84] Lucas also claimed to have co-written a treatment for *Indiana Jones* and *Willow*, at the same time as drafting *Star Wars*.[85]\n3. **^** In 1977, a writer for *New Journal and Guide* called *Star Wars* \"one of the most racist movies ever produced\", with \"the force of evil ... dressed in all black and [having] the voice of a black man\".[210]\n4. **^** In a 1978 appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson*, scientist Carl Sagan called it \"extremely unlikely\" that the beings of another galaxy would look human, further stating his criticism of the ubiquitous whiteness of the humans seen in the film. He also cited the fact that Chewbacca does not receive a medal at the end as \"anti-Wookiee discrimination\"; this issue would become contentious among fans.[211][212]\n5. **^** The main title page for the film's script had the lines of text and graphical elements: *STAR WARS*; double horizontal lines; *EPISODE*; *IV*; *A NEW HOPE*; *FROM THE*; *JOURNAL OF THE WHILLS*; BY; GEORGE LUCAS; 12 height sequenced character images from R2-D2 to Chewbacca; REVISED FOURTH DRAFT; January 15, 1976; horizontal line; LUCASFILM LTD.; 7 [page#][238] The script, interspersed with illustrations, then spans 128 pages of the 175-page book.\n6. **^**  One account[244] places the title change at the film's re-release in July 1978. (Hearn 2005, p.\u00a0124)\n7. **^** Some of Lucas's early script drafts bear titles such as *\"The Adventures of the Starkiller (Episode One): The Star Wars\"* (1975) or *\"The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as Taken from the Journal of the Whills: Saga One: Star Wars\"* (1976).[247][248][249]\n8. **^** In Italian, the lightsabers are known as \"spade laser\" (\"laser swords\", which was their original name).\n9. **^** Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the other five films.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars\".

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell\u2014it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves\u2014again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15\u00a0million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77\u201378% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8\u00a0million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799\u00a0billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2\u00a0billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640\u00a0million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2\u00a0billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5\u00a0billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120\u2013140\u00a0million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5\u00a0million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200\u2013250\u00a0million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260\u2013300\u00a0million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260\u2013270\u00a0million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300\u00a0million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1\u00a0million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100\u00a0million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5\u00a0million, including $60\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3\u00a0million), and Sunday ($90.4\u00a0million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314\u00a0million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9\u00a0million on Monday and $33.1\u00a0million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4\u00a0million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3\u00a0million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600\u00a0million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8\u00a0million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700\u00a0million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2\u00a0million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3\u00a0million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800\u00a0million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1\u00a0million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2\u00a0million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680\u00a0million over its first five days for a global debut of $850\u2013950\u00a0million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250\u2013280\u00a0million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5\u00a0million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2\u00a0million (RMB 189\u00a0million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1\u00a0million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300\u00a0million.[163] Overall, the film made $169\u00a0million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9\u00a0million), South Korea ($8.4\u00a0million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1\u00a0million), France ($6\u00a0million), and Italy ($5.8\u00a0million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866\u00a0million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5\u00a0million; RMB 2.22\u00a0billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($47.4\u00a0million), Mexico ($33.1\u00a0million), Australia ($30.8\u00a0million), Brazil ($26\u00a0million), Spain ($13.3\u00a0million), Japan ($13\u00a0million),[152] and Vietnam ($10\u00a0million).[180] It also made $21.6\u00a0million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($68.2\u00a0million), South Korea ($60.3\u00a0million), Mexico ($48.6\u00a0million), and India ($40.9\u00a0million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569\u00a0billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January\u00a02021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632\u00a0million), United Kingdom ($115\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million), Brazil ($86\u00a0million), and Mexico ($78\u00a0million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clich\u00e9d time travel plot \u2013 the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.
