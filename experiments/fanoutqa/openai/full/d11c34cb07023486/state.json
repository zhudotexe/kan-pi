Under new head coach Todd Bowles, they succeeded in matching their previous season\u2019s win count in just five games, starting 4\u20131. Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team regressed to 5\u20135, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers, who also finished 10\u20136, clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents. The Jets finished the season as the league's only team with a winning record to not make the playoffs, and as of 2023, this was the last Jets team to post a winning record. This was also tied with the 2020 Miami Dolphins season as the closest quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick came to making the playoffs in his 17-year career.\n\n\n\n\n## Transactions[edit]\n\n\n### Coaching and staff personnel changes[edit]\n\n\n* The Jets fired general manager John Idzik and head coach Rex Ryan on December 29, 2014.[1]\n* Offensive line coach Mike Devlin left the Jets to accept the same position with the Houston Texans on January 9, 2015.[2]\n* The Jets hired Mike Maccagnan as general manager on January 13, 2015.[3]\n* The Jets hired Todd Bowles as head coach on January 14, 2015.[4]\n* Jets defensive coordinator Dennis Thurman, defensive line coach Karl Dunbar, linebackers coach Bobby April III, defensive backs coach Tim McDonald, assistant defensive line coach Jeff Weeks, and assistant strength and conditioning coach Jason Oszvart were hired to the same positions by the Buffalo Bills on January 15, 2015.

The Patriots would win the toss, choosing heads. However, instead of receiving the ball to give Tom Brady the first chance to score, the Patriots elected to kick. This caused much confusion in Patriots captain Matthew Slater, as he questioned after the toss if the Patriots, because they won the toss, would also get to choose which end of the field they would like to kick. However, referee Clete Blakeman said \"You elected to kick\", and the Patriots were unable to choose which end of the field to kick off to, as in the NFL rule book, the team that loses the coin toss gets to choose which end to receive the ball, if the team that wins the toss elects to defer. If the team that wins the coin toss receives, the team that loses the toss will elect which way to kick. The Jets would get the ball first. They would march right down the field to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession as Ryan Fitzpatrick found Eric Decker to end the game with a touchdown. With their fifth straight win, the Jets improved to 10-5.\n\n\nAs of 2023, this is the last time that the Jets have beaten the Patriots.\n\n\n\n### Week 17: at Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\n**Week Seventeen: New York Jets at Buffalo Bills\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jets | 0 | 7 | 10 | 0 | **17** |\n| **Bills** | 7 | 9 | 3 | 3 | **22** |\n\n\n*at Ralph Wilson Stadium, Orchard Park, New York*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: January 3, 2016\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EST\n* **Game weather**: 35\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n* **Game attendance**: 68,670\n* **Referee**: Walt Anderson\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts and Evan Washburn\n* Recap, Gamebook\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor 18-yard run (Dan Carpenter kick), 5:55. *Bills 7\u20130. **Drive: 3 plays, 25 yards, 1:19.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Karlos Williams 2-yard run (kick failed), 13:02. *Bills 13\u20130. **Drive: 13 plays, 70 yards, 6:21.***\n* NYJ \u2013 Brandon Marshall 17-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Randy Bullock kick), 9:42. *Bills 13\u20137. **Drive: 3 plays, 60 yards, 1:26.***\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 20-yard field goal, 0:27. *Bills 16\u20137. **Drive: 15 plays, 70 yards, 9:16.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* NYJ \u2013 Randy Bullock 39-yard field goal, 13:24. *Bills 16\u201310. **Drive: 4 plays, 2 yards, 0:49.***\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 37-yard field goal, 5:05. *Bills 19\u201310. **Drive: 14 plays, 66 yards, 8:19.***\n* NYJ \u2013 Eric Decker 21-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Randy Bullock kick), 1:15. *Bills 19\u201317. **Drive: 11 plays, 77 yards, 3:52.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 42-yard field goal, 3:53. *Bills 22\u201317. **Drive: 13 plays, 56 yards, 6:54.***\n | **Top passers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 16/37, 181 yards, 2 TD, 3 INT\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor \u2013 18/28, 182 yards\n\n**Top rushers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Chris Ivory \u2013 6 rushes, 81 yards\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor \u2013 10 rushes, 51 yards, TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Brandon Marshall \u2013 8 receptions, 126 yards, TD\n* BUF \u2013 Sammy Watkins \u2013 11 receptions, 136 yards\n\n**Top tacklers**\n* NYJ \u2013 David Harris \u2013 14 tackles, 2.0 sacks\n* BUF \u2013 Corey Graham \u2013 6 tackles\n\n\n |\n |\nWith the loss, and with the Steelers defeating the Browns the same day, the Jets finished their season 10-6 and were eliminated from the playoffs. This was also the first time since 2004 that one NFL team defeated another twice in the same season and both games ended with the same score. The Jets were also seeking a 6-game winning streak for the first time since 1986. It was also quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's first return to Buffalo since the Bills released him following the 2012 season. Fitzpatrick played for the Bills from 2009 to 2012.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Johnson, Woody (December 29, 2014). \"Johnson Official Statement on Idzik and Ryan\". New York Jets.

Fitzpatrick started at quarterback for nine different teams, the most in league history. He is also the only NFL player to have both a passing and rushing touchdown with eight different teams.\n\n\nFitzpatrick played college football at Harvard University, where he was the school's first quarterback to have over 1,000 rushing yards, and was selected by the St. Louis Rams in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Fitzpatrick's longest stint was with the Buffalo Bills for four seasons, while his only two winning seasons were with the 2015 New York Jets and the 2020 Miami Dolphins. As a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2018, Fitzpatrick became the first NFL quarterback to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games. He holds the most career passing yards and passing touchdowns among NFL quarterbacks without a postseason appearance.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWhile an economics student at Harvard University, Fitzpatrick had five starts for the Crimson during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, working as the backup for Neil Rose.[3] In 2002, Fitzpatrick recorded 1,155 passing yards with eight touchdowns and no interceptions to go along with 523 rushing yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\nAfter Rose graduated in 2003, Fitzpatrick took over the starting job and finished his junior campaign with 1,770 yards, 16 touchdowns, and eight interceptions in seven games. Additionally, he ran for 430 yards and six touchdowns, leading his team to a 7\u20133 record.[4]\n\n\nIn 2004, Fitzpatrick was named the Ivy League Player of the Year and winner of the George H. \"Bulger\" Lowe Award, as he accumulated 1,986 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also led Harvard to a 10\u20130 record, thus winning the Ivy League Championship.[5] He ranked second on the team with 448 rushing yards and five scores.\n\n\nFor his career, Fitzpatrick ranked second on Harvard's career list for pass completions, touchdowns, passing yards, and pass completion percentage, topped only by Neil Rose.[*citation needed*] Fitzpatrick's 641 pass attempts rank fourth in school history and his 1,006 total plays for 6,721 yards in total offense broke the old school career records of 1,005 plays by Mike Giardi (1991\u201393) and 6,519 yards by Rose.[*citation needed*] Fitzpatrick was also the school's first quarterback to rush for over 1,000 career yards.[6]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nLike most incoming NFL rookies, Fitzpatrick took the Wonderlic test. Fitzpatrick completed the test in nine minutes, with rumors indicating that he obtained a perfect score of 50.[7] However, a 2005 *The Wall Street Journal* report said that Fitzpatrick scored a 48, which is still considered exceptionally high. While his actual score is unknown, Fitzpatrick has acknowledged leaving at least one question blank, making 49 his highest possible score.[8] To date, Fitzpatrick has the highest reported Wonderlic test score achieved among NFL quarterbacks. The only player to earn a verified perfect score on the Wonderlic was also a Harvard graduate: wide receiver/punter Pat McInally, who played his entire career for the Cincinnati Bengals.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Wonderlic |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\u00a0ft 2+3\u20448\u00a0in(1.89\u00a0m)\n | 232\u00a0lb(105\u00a0kg)\n | 31+1\u20448\u00a0in(0.79\u00a0m)\n | 10+3\u20444\u00a0in(0.27\u00a0m) | 4.87 s | 1.71 s | 2.83 s | 4.07 s | 7.09 s | 30.5\u00a0in(0.77\u00a0m) | 8\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in(2.67\u00a0m) | 48 |\n| All from NFL Combine.[10][11][12] |\n\n\n### St. Louis Rams[edit]\n\n\n#### 2005 season[edit]\n\n\nThe St. Louis Rams selected Fitzpatrick in the seventh round (250th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Fitzpatrick was the last of 14 quarterbacks drafted in 2005.[13]\n\n\nOn July 18, 2005, the Rams signed Fitzpatrick to a three-year, $953,000 contract.[14] Throughout training camp, Fitzpatrick competed for a roster spot against Jeff Smoker to be the Rams' third-string quarterback. Head coach Mike Martz named Fitzpatrick the third-string quarterback on the depth chart to begin his rookie season, behind Marc Bulger and Jamie Martin. Fitzpatrick was upgraded to the primary backup role in Week 6 after Bulger sustained a shoulder injury and was placed on injured reserve.\n\n\nOn November 27, 2005, Fitzpatrick made his professional regular season debut after entering the game in the second quarter against the Houston Texans to replace injured veteran journeyman Jamie Martin. Fitzpatrick completed 19 of 30 passes for 310 yards and three touchdowns for a 117.4 quarterback rating and led the Rams from a 24\u20133 halftime deficit to a 33\u201327 overtime road victory.[15] He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort.[16] This made Fitzpatrick one of only eight players who passed for more than 300 yards in their NFL debut. The win earned him the next three starts, making Fitzpatrick the first Harvard quarterback to start an NFL game.[17]\n\n\nFitzpatrick was unable to duplicate his debut performance in the games he started with the Rams coming two weeks later in a 27\u201313 road loss to the Minnesota Vikings, throwing for 235 yards and five interceptions for a QB rating of 32.4 for the game.[18] Fitzpatrick was replaced by Martin after halftime the following week, after struggling in a home game against the Philadelphia Eagles in which he completed just 41.7% of his passes for a total of 69 yards.[19]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished his rookie season completing 76 of 153 passes for 777 yards, four touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with 14 carries for 64 yards and two touchdowns in four games and three starts.[20]\n\n\n\n#### 2006 season[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Fitzpatrick appeared in only one game, appearing late in the regular season finale against the Minnesota Vikings in relief of Marc Bulger and ran out the clock in the 41\u201321 road victory.[21]\n\n\n\n### Cincinnati Bengals[edit]\n\n\n#### 2007 season[edit]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2007, Fitzpatrick was traded to the Cincinnati Bengals for a seventh-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft.[22]\n\n\n\n#### 2008 season[edit]\n\n\nA restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Fitzpatrick signed his one-year tender offer from the Bengals on April 17.\n\n\nDue to an elbow injury to starting quarterback Carson Palmer, Fitzpatrick made his first Bengals start on September 28, 2008, against the Cleveland Browns. Fitzpatrick was not only the leading passer but also the leading rusher in the 20\u201312 loss, finishing with 156 passing yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions to go along with 41 rushing yards.[23] Palmer returned the next week to start against the Dallas Cowboys, but once again had to sit the following week to rest his elbow.[24] On October 12, 2008, Fitzpatrick got the start against the New York Jets and every other game for the rest of the season.\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the season with 1,905 passing yards, eight touchdowns, and nine interceptions to go along with 60 carries for 304 yards and two touchdowns in 13 games and 12 starts.[25] His 304 rushing yards ranked third among quarterbacks behind Tyler Thigpen and David Garrard.[26]\n\n\n\n### Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick with the Buffalo Bills in 2009\nOn February 27, 2009, Fitzpatrick signed a three-year, $7.4 million contract with the Buffalo Bills.[27]\n\n\nFitzpatrick made his first appearance on October 18, 2009, against the New York Jets when starter Trent Edwards went down with an injury. Fitzpatrick threw for 116 yards, a touchdown, and an interception and led the Bills to a 16\u201313 overtime victory.[28] He started the following two games, resulting in a 20-9 road victory over the Carolina Panthers and a 31-10 loss to the Houston Texans.[29][30]\n\n\nOn November 18, 2009, Fitzpatrick was named the starter by interim head coach Perry Fewell who took over the coaching duties after former head coach Dick Jauron was fired. Fitzpatrick went 3\u20133 as a starter under Fewell, throwing for 1,060 yards, seven touchdowns, and six interceptions. Fitzpatrick went 5\u20134 in games where he had a majority of the playing time for a team that finished with a 6\u201310 record. During a Week 11 18-15 road loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw a 98-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, the longest touchdown reception and pass for both Owens and Fitzpatrick, also setting the team record for the longest touchdown pass.[31][32]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2009 season with 1,422 passing yards, nine touchdowns, 10 interceptions, and rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries in 10 games and eight starts.[33]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 season[edit]\n\n\nNew head coach Chan Gailey decided to go with Trent Edwards as the starter for the 2010 season, relegating Fitzpatrick to the backup role. On September 20, 2010, he was named the new starting quarterback following the Bills' 0\u20132 start.[34]\n\n\nDuring a Week 11 49\u201331 comeback road victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 316 yards and four touchdowns, including three to Stevie Johnson, and two interceptions.[35] Despite the Bills finishing at 4\u201312 (4\u20139 with him at quarterback), Fitzpatrick recorded at least one touchdown pass in 13 consecutive games and becoming the first Bills quarterback to pass for at least 3,000 yards in a season since J. P. Losman in 2006.[36]\n\n\nOverall, Fitzpatrick finished the season with 3,000 passing yards, 23 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions to go along with 40 carries for 269 yards in 13 games and starts.[37]\n\n\n\n#### 2011 season[edit]\n\n\nDuring a Week 2 comeback 38-35 victory over the Oakland Raiders, Fitzpatrick led the Bills to touchdown drives on five straight possessions in the second half.[38] It was the first time in league history a team had scored offensive touchdowns on five straight possessions in the second half.[39] He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September.\n\n\nOn October 28, 2011, Fitzpatrick signed a six-year, $59 million contract extension including a $10 million signing bonus with the Bills.[40] He had three 300-yard performances in the 2011 season, with a season-high 369 yards during a Week 3 34-31 comeback victory over the New England Patriots.[41]\n\n\nAfter the 2011 season, it was revealed that Fitzpatrick had broken his ribs in a game against the Washington Redskins, which was presumably a factor in his decline in play over the rest of the season. Fitzpatrick finished the 2011 season with 3,832 yards, 24 touchdowns, and a league-leading 23 interceptions to go along with 56 carries for 215 yards in 16 games and starts.[42]\n\n\n\n#### 2012 season[edit]\n\n\nFitzpatrick returned as the Bills' starter in 2012, finishing with 3,400 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions to go along with 48 carries for 197 yards and a touchdown in 16 games and starts.[43] Following Chan Gailey's firing after the season, the Bills opted not to hold on to Fitzpatrick, releasing him on March 12, 2013.[44]\n\n\n\n### Tennessee Titans[edit]\n\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year contract with the Tennessee Titans.[45]\n\n\nDuring a Week 4 38\u201313 victory over the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick made his Titans debut, replacing an injured Jake Locker in the third quarter. Fitzpatrick completed three of eight passes for 108 yards and a 77-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington.[46]\n\n\nFitzpatrick played in 11 games and started in nine of them. He finished the season with a 3\u20136 record as the starting quarterback, beating division rivals Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans in the final two games of the season.

Following an incident in the locker room, in which starting quarterback Geno Smith suffered a broken jaw after being punched by linebacker IK Enemkpali, Fitzpatrick was tentatively named the Week 1 starter for the Jets.[58]\n\n\nMaking his first start for the Jets in the season-opening 31-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns, Fitzpatrick threw for 179 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 31\u201310 victory.[59] In the next game against the Indianapolis Colts on *Monday Night Football*, he threw for 244 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Jets won on the road by a score of 20\u20137.[60] The following week against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick threw for 283 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in the 17\u201324 loss.[61] During a Week 4 27-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London, Fitzpatrick threw for 218 yards, a touchdown, and an interception.[62] Two weeks later against the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick threw for 253 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception while also rushing for 31 yards and a touchdown in the 34\u201320 victory.[63] During a Week 7 30-23 road loss to the New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 295 yards and two touchdowns.[64]\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of a Week 8 34-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders, Fitzpatrick suffered torn ligaments in his left thumb while scrambling and did not play for the remainder of the game, being relieved by Geno Smith.

Fitzpatrick also had 60 carries for 270 yards and two touchdowns.[78][79]\n\n\n\n#### 2016 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick in 2016\nFitzpatrick, a free agent after the 2015 season, signed a one-year fully guaranteed $12 million contract with the Jets on July 27, 2016.[80]\n\n\nDuring the narrow season-opening 23-22 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 189 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.[81] In the next game on *Thursday Night Football* against the Buffalo Bills, he improved gradually with 374 passing yards and a touchdown, leading the Jets to a 37\u201331 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[82][83] The following week against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Jets committed eight turnovers, including Fitzpatrick throwing six interceptions. Fitzpatrick finished with 188 passing yards as the Jets lost on the road by a score of 24\u20133.[84] During a Week 6 28-3 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick was benched for Geno Smith after going 16-for-31 for 174 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception.[85]\n\n\nSmith was then named the starter for the next game against the Baltimore Ravens.[86] However, he suffered a season-ending injury and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter.[87][88] Fitzpatrick then started the team's next two games against the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins before sitting out against the Los Angeles Rams due to injury.[89] Bryce Petty started in his place even though Fitzpatrick was still active for the game as the backup.[90] Fitzpatrick then returned from his injury to start the next two games against the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts.[89] However, during the Colts game, he was benched for Petty to start the second half.[91]\n\n\nPetty was then named the starter for the final four games of the season. Jets head coach Todd Bowles said, \"The plan was for us to start him the last four games anyway, so we just started a half early.\"[92] Petty then started the next three games against the San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins, and New England Patriots.[93] During the Dolphins game, Fitzpatrick relieved Petty due to injury early in the fourth quarter.[94] Petty also suffered an injury in the Patriots game and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter.[95] Due to Petty's injury, Fitzpatrick started in the regular season finale, completing 20 of 30 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets beat the Bills by a score of 30\u201310.[96]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2016 season with 2,710 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and 17 interceptions to go along with 33 carries for 130 yards in 14 games and 11 starts.[97]\n\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Fitzpatrick's contract was voided, and he became a free agent.[98]\n\n\n\n### Tampa Bay Buccaneers[edit]\n\n\n#### 2017 season[edit]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2017, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Fitzpatrick to a one-year, $3 million contract.[99][100][101][102]\n\n\nDuring a Week 6 38-33 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick entered the game after starter Jameis Winston suffered a shoulder injury in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick finished the game by completing 22 of 32 passes for 290 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[103] Three weeks later against the New Orleans Saints, Fitzpatrick entered the game after Winston suffered another shoulder injury, completing eight of 15 passes for 68 yards and a touchdown in the 30\u201310 road loss.[104] On November 6, head coach Dirk Koetter said that Winston would miss at least two weeks to rest his shoulder.[105] Fitzpatrick started in Week 10 against his former team, the New York Jets, throwing for 187 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Buccaneers won by a score of 15\u201310.[106] In the next game against the Miami Dolphins, Fitzpatrick threw for 275 yards and two touchdowns as the Buccaneers won on the road by a score of 30\u201320.[107] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, he threw for 283 yards as the Buccaneers lost on the road by a score of 34-20.[108]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2017 season with 1,103 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions to go along with 15 carries for 78 yards in six games and three starts.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick in 2018\nOn March 9, 2018, Fitzpatrick signed a one-year contract extension with the Buccaneers.[110] Starter Jameis Winston was handed a three-game suspension, making Fitzpatrick the Buccaneers' starting quarterback to begin the season.\n\n\nDuring the season-opening 48-40 road victory over the New Orleans Saints, Fitzpatrick completed 21 of 28 passes for a career-high 417 yards and four touchdowns, while also rushing for 36 yards and a touchdown, finishing with a 156.2 QB rating.[111] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[112] In the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick completed 27 of 33 passes for 402 yards and four touchdowns, finishing with a 144.4 QB rating despite an interception (which was after a juggle his receiver made) as the Buccaneers won by a score of 27\u201321.[113] He earned his second consecutive NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[114] Fitzpatrick's unexpectedly incredible performance during the first two weeks of the season revived his \"Fitzmagic\" nickname. The following week against the Pittsburgh Steelers on *Monday Night Football*, Fitzpatrick finished with 411 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Buccaneers narrowly lost by a score of 30\u201327.[115] He became the first player in NFL history to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games.[116] During a Week 4 48\u201310 road loss to the Chicago Bears, Fitzpatrick's performance regressed as he only threw for 126 yards and an interception. Fitzpatrick was replaced by Winston, who had just been reinstated from a three-game suspension.[117]\n\n\nDuring a Week 8 37-34 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick relieved Winston at the end of the third quarter after Winston was benched after throwing for 276 yards, a touchdown, and four interceptions. Fitzpatrick completed 11 of 15 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns to tie the game 34\u201334 with 1:05 left in the game after being down 34\u201316, but the Bengals would then drive down the field and kick a game-winning field goal as time expired.[118] The next day, the Buccaneers named Fitzpatrick their starting quarterback.[119] In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, he threw for 243 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Buccaneers lost on the road by a score of 42-28.[120] The following week against the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick had his fourth 400-yard passing game of the season, throwing for 406 yards and two interceptions, which tied Dan Marino and Peyton Manning for the single-season record as the Buccaneers lost by a score of 16\u20133.[121] During a narrow Week 11 38\u201335 road loss to the New York Giants, Fitzpatrick was benched for Winston again in the second half after throwing for 167 yards and three interceptions in what would be his final appearance of the 2018 season.[122]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2018 season with 2,366 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a career-high passer rating of 100.4 to go along with 36 carries for 152 yards and two touchdowns in eight games and seven starts.[123]\n\n\n\n### Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\n#### 2019 season[edit]\n\n\nOn March 18, 2019, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Miami Dolphins.[124][125] He was named the Dolphins starting quarterback over Josh Rosen.[126]\n\n\nDuring the season-opening 59-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Fitzpatrick threw for 185 yards, a touchdown, and an interception.[127] In the next game against the New England Patriots, he threw for 89 yards and was intercepted thrice, with two being pick-sixes, before being benched for Rosen in the 43\u20130 shutout loss.[128] After the game, Dolphins' head coach Brian Flores said that Fitzpatrick would still be the starter in Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys,[129] but on September 19, prior to the game, Rosen was named the starter, sending Fitzpatrick to the bench.[130]\n\n\nDuring a narrow Week 6 17-16 loss to the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick relieved Rosen after the latter was benched for poor performance. Fitzpatrick threw for 132 yards and a touchdown. After leading Miami to a last-minute touchdown, he attempted a two-point conversion pass to Kenyan Drake, who dropped it, sealing the loss for Miami.[131] Fitzpatrick started the next game against the Buffalo Bills, his former team, leading the Dolphins to a 14\u20139 halftime lead. However, after he threw an interception to cornerback Tre'Davious White, the Bills rallied in the fourth quarter to win. Fitzpatrick finished the 31-21 road loss with 282 passing yards, a touchdown, and an interception to go along with six carries for 13 yards and a touchdown.[132] Two weeks later against another of his former teams, the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick threw for 288 yards and three touchdowns as the Dolphins won their first game of the season by a score of 26\u201318.[133] During a Week 13 37-31 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, he threw for 365 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception.[134] Three weeks later against the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 419 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception as the Dolphins won by a score of 38\u201335 in overtime.[135] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Bengals.[136] In the regular season finale against the Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 320 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 15 yards and a touchdown during the 27\u201324 road victory. The win denied the Patriots a first-round bye for the first time since 2009. He also played against Tom Brady in his final regular season game as a Patriot, as he would sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the offseason. Fitzpatrick is also the only quarterback to defeat Tom Brady with all the Patriots\u2019 division rivals.[137]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2019 season with 3,529 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions to go along with 54 carries for 243 yards and four touchdowns in 15 games and 13 starts.[138] He ended up being the team's leading rusher for the 2019 season.[139]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2020, Fitzpatrick was confirmed to have won the Dolphins starting job for the second year in a row after beating out rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa in training camp.[140]\n\n\nDuring the season-opening 21-11 road loss against the New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 191 yards and three interceptions.[141] In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he had 328 passing yards and two touchdowns as the Dolphins narrowly lost by a score of 31\u201328.[142] The following week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw for 160 yards and two touchdowns to go along with seven carries for 38 yards and a touchdown during the 31\u201313 victory. In doing so, he extended his NFL record for wins against a single opponent with different teams to six.[143] Fitzpatrick also joined Walter Payton as the only players since 1948 to finish with two passing touchdowns, a rushing touchdown, 20 rushing yards, and a reception in the same game.[144]\n\n\nDuring a Week 5 43-17 road victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Fitzpatrick threw for 350 yards and three touchdowns.[145] In the next game against one of his former teams, the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick threw for 191 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions during the 24\u20130 shutout victory.[146] Two days later on October 20, Brian Flores named Tagovailoa the team's starting quarter for the Week 8 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams following the bye week.[147]\n\n\nDuring a Week 11 20-13 road loss to the Denver Broncos, Fitzpatrick relieved Tagovailoa in the fourth quarter after he was benched for poor performance. During the game, Fitzpatrick threw for 117 yards and an interception.[148] Fitzpatrick was named the Dolphins' starting quarterback for the next game against the Jets after Tagovailoa jammed his thumb in practice.[149] During that game, Fitzpatrick threw for 257 yards and a touchdown in the 20\u20133 road victory.[150]\n\n\nDuring a narrow Week 16 26-25 road victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, Fitzpatrick was brought in to relieve Tagovailoa early in the fourth quarter after the latter was benched. Fitzpatrick led a game-winning drive where he found Mack Hollins for a 34-yard completion down while having his face mask pulled with 19 seconds left in the game and down 25\u201323 with no timeouts. The pass, coupled with the 15-yard face mask penalty, led to a game-winning field goal by Jason Sanders.

The team improved on their 4\u201312 record in 2014 under former head Coach Rex Ryan. Under new head coach Todd Bowles, they succeeded in matching their previous season\u2019s win count in just five games, starting 4\u20131. Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team regressed to 5\u20135, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers, who also finished 10\u20136, clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents. The Jets finished the season as the league's only team with a winning record to not make the playoffs, and as of 2023, this was the last Jets team to post a winning record. This was also tied with the 2020 Miami Dolphins season as the closest quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick came to making the playoffs in his 17-year career.\n\n\n\n\n## Transactions[edit]\n\n\n### Coaching and staff personnel changes[edit]\n\n\n* The Jets fired general manager John Idzik and head coach Rex Ryan on December 29, 2014.[1]\n* Offensive line coach Mike Devlin left the Jets to accept the same position with the Houston Texans on January 9, 2015.[2]\n* The Jets hired Mike Maccagnan as general manager on January 13, 2015.[3]\n* The Jets hired Todd Bowles as head coach on January 14, 2015.[4]\n* Jets defensive coordinator Dennis Thurman, defensive line coach Karl Dunbar, linebackers coach Bobby April III, defensive backs coach Tim McDonald, assistant defensive line coach Jeff Weeks, and assistant strength and conditioning coach Jason Oszvart were hired to the same positions by the Buffalo Bills on January 15, 2015.

The Patriots would win the toss, choosing heads. However, instead of receiving the ball to give Tom Brady the first chance to score, the Patriots elected to kick. This caused much confusion in Patriots captain Matthew Slater, as he questioned after the toss if the Patriots, because they won the toss, would also get to choose which end of the field they would like to kick. However, referee Clete Blakeman said \"You elected to kick\", and the Patriots were unable to choose which end of the field to kick off to, as in the NFL rule book, the team that loses the coin toss gets to choose which end to receive the ball, if the team that wins the toss elects to defer. If the team that wins the coin toss receives, the team that loses the toss will elect which way to kick. The Jets would get the ball first. They would march right down the field to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession as Ryan Fitzpatrick found Eric Decker to end the game with a touchdown. With their fifth straight win, the Jets improved to 10-5.\n\n\nAs of 2023, this is the last time that the Jets have beaten the Patriots.\n\n\n\n### Week 17: at Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\n**Week Seventeen: New York Jets at Buffalo Bills\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jets | 0 | 7 | 10 | 0 | **17** |\n| **Bills** | 7 | 9 | 3 | 3 | **22** |\n\n\n*at Ralph Wilson Stadium, Orchard Park, New York*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: January 3, 2016\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EST\n* **Game weather**: 35\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n* **Game attendance**: 68,670\n* **Referee**: Walt Anderson\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts and Evan Washburn\n* Recap, Gamebook\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor 18-yard run (Dan Carpenter kick), 5:55. *Bills 7\u20130. **Drive: 3 plays, 25 yards, 1:19.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Karlos Williams 2-yard run (kick failed), 13:02. *Bills 13\u20130. **Drive: 13 plays, 70 yards, 6:21.***\n* NYJ \u2013 Brandon Marshall 17-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Randy Bullock kick), 9:42. *Bills 13\u20137. **Drive: 3 plays, 60 yards, 1:26.***\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 20-yard field goal, 0:27. *Bills 16\u20137. **Drive: 15 plays, 70 yards, 9:16.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* NYJ \u2013 Randy Bullock 39-yard field goal, 13:24. *Bills 16\u201310. **Drive: 4 plays, 2 yards, 0:49.***\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 37-yard field goal, 5:05. *Bills 19\u201310. **Drive: 14 plays, 66 yards, 8:19.***\n* NYJ \u2013 Eric Decker 21-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Randy Bullock kick), 1:15. *Bills 19\u201317. **Drive: 11 plays, 77 yards, 3:52.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 42-yard field goal, 3:53. *Bills 22\u201317. **Drive: 13 plays, 56 yards, 6:54.***\n | **Top passers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 16/37, 181 yards, 2 TD, 3 INT\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor \u2013 18/28, 182 yards\n\n**Top rushers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Chris Ivory \u2013 6 rushes, 81 yards\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor \u2013 10 rushes, 51 yards, TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Brandon Marshall \u2013 8 receptions, 126 yards, TD\n* BUF \u2013 Sammy Watkins \u2013 11 receptions, 136 yards\n\n**Top tacklers**\n* NYJ \u2013 David Harris \u2013 14 tackles, 2.0 sacks\n* BUF \u2013 Corey Graham \u2013 6 tackles\n\n\n |\n |\nWith the loss, and with the Steelers defeating the Browns the same day, the Jets finished their season 10-6 and were eliminated from the playoffs.

They tried to improve on their previous output in which they won eight games. Instead, they collapsed and finished the season with a 6\u201310 record and finished the season with double-digit losses for the first time since 1998. From 2006 onwards the Rams continued to crumble: during the subsequent nine seasons in St. Louis, the team neither made it into the playoffs nor finished with a winning record (though they almost made it into the 2010 playoffs, but lost to the Seahawks in their last game to lose the division). Their 6\u201342 record between 2007 and 2009 was the worst for such a period by any team between the World War II Chicago Cardinals and the 2015 to 2017 Cleveland Browns.\n\n\nOn October 10, news broke out that head coach Mike Martz announced he was leaving the team indefinitely after being diagnosed with a bacterial infection. A day before that, he coached his last game in a home loss against Seattle. Joe Vitt took over the sidelines for the rest of the season. Though Martz was medically cleared to return, management refused to let him do so and he was fired the day after the final regular season game. Several players said they enjoyed having Martz as their head coach.\n\n\nAs second-year running back Steven Jackson earned the starting position, this year was the final season for future Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk as he missed the following season because of reconstructive knee surgery, which ultimately led to his retirement in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2005 St. Louis Rams final roster**\n|  |\n|  | **Quarterbacks*** \n* 12 *Ryan Fitzpatrick*\n* \n* 11 Jamie Martin\n* \n* 15 Jeff Smoker\n\n**Running backs**\n* \n* 26 Aveion Cason KR\n* \n* 28 Marshall Faulk\n* \n* 33 Arlen Harris\n* \n* 44 *Madison Hedgecock*\n* \n* 39 Steven Jackson\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* \n* 80 Isaac Bruce\n* \n* 83 Kevin Curtis\n* \n* 81 Torry Holt\n* \n* 89 Dane Looker PR\n* \n* 84 Shaun McDonald PR\n\n**Tight ends**\n* \n* 48 *Jerome Collins*\n* \n* 86 Brandon Manumaleuna\n* \n* 87 Aaron Walker\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** \n* 70 *Alex Barron* T\n* \n* 67 Andy McCollum C\n* \n* 71 Matt Morgan T\n* \n* 63 Ben Noll G\n* \n* 76 Orlando Pace T\n* \n* 75 *Claude Terrell* G\n* \n* 62 Adam Timmerman G\n* \n* 66 Rex Tucker G/T\n* \n* 63 Larry Turner C\n\n**Defensive linemen**\n* \n* 90 *Jeremy Calahan* DT\n* \n* 93 Brandon Green DE\n* \n* 95 Anthony Hargrove DE\n* \n* 98 Brian Howard DT\n* \n* 73 Jimmy Kennedy DT\n* \n* 97 Tyoka Jackson DE/DT\n* \n* 92 Damione Lewis DT\n* \n* 91 Leonard Little DE\n* \n* 79 Ryan Pickett DT\n |  | **Linebackers*** \n* 54 Brandon Chillar OLB\n* \n* 99 *Clifford Dukes* OLB\n* \n* 57 Trev Faulk MLB\n* \n* 51 *Mike Goolsby* MLB\n* \n* 56 Jeremy Loyd OLB\n* \n* 50 Pisa Tinoisamoa OLB\n* \n* 58 Drew Wahlroos OLB\n\n**Defensive backs**\n* \n* 20 Dwight Anderson CB\n* \n* 31 Adam Archuleta SS\n* \n* 21 *O.J.

The season began with the Rams trying to improve on their 6\u201310 record from 2005 under new head coach Scott Linehan. This was the Rams last non-losing season in St. Louis as the franchise would go on a ten-season losing record streak until 2017 in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\nScott Linehan was named head coach of the St. Louis Rams on January 19, 2006. He previously served as the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins.

Wilkins also tied a franchise record of seven field goal attempts in one game which was first accomplished by Bob Waterfield on December 9, 1951.[6] The Rams were unable to score a touchdown all game and went 0 for 5 in the red zone.[7]\n\n\nThe defense allowed just one touchdown and forced five turnovers. Three of these turnovers were interceptions, from a team that only allowed seven interceptions all of last season. First round draft pick Tye Hill intercepted a pass by Jake Plummer with 12:02 in the second quarter.[8] It was his first in his NFL career.[6] The defense also sacked Jake Plummer four times in the game, with Leonard Little accounting for two of them.[7]\n\n\nIsaac Bruce passed Henry Ellard and Shannon Sharpe for 11th most receptions in an NFL career with his five receptions for 64 yards.[6]\n\n\nCenter Andy McCollum injured his left knee with 7:39 left in the second quarter and was out for the rest of the game. On September 11, 2006 it was announced that McCollum will miss the entire season and will undergo knee surgery. With the win, the Rams began their season 1\u20130.[9]\n\n\n\n### Week 2: at San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rams\n | 0\n | 10\n | 0\n | 3 | **13** |\n| **49ers** | 3\n | 0\n | 14\n | 3 | **20** |\n\n\n*at Monster Park, San Francisco, California*\nThe Rams visited division rival San Francisco 49ers on September 17 for their home opener.

The 49ers took the lead at 10:54 in the third quarter with a 72-yard pass from Smith to Antonio Bryant. Each team had a field goal in the fourth quarter. Wilkins hit a 40-yard field goal with 11:06 in the fourth, and Nedney had a 20-yard field goal with 5:23 in the fourth.[10][11]\n\n\nBulger was sacked six times in the game and completed 19 of 34 attempts for 147 yards. Steven Jackson had 103 yards on the ground on 22 carries, along with 2 receptions for 21 yards. Will Witherspoon also had a good game making 13 tackles[12] and forcing one fumble. The Rams had 118 total yards during the second half.[10]\n\n\nLeft tackle Orlando Pace left the game at the half with a concussion. He was taken to a hospital in the bay area where a CAT scan turned up negative. Linebacker Pisa Tinoisamoa dislocated his elbow in the third quarter, and missed the rest of the game. With the loss, the Rams fell to 1\u20131.[13]\n\n\n\n### Week 3: at Arizona Cardinals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Rams** | 0\n | 13\n | 3\n | 0 | **16** |\n| Cardinals\n | 7\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7 | **14** |\n\n\n*at University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona*\nThe Rams traveled to Glendale, Arizona for their first game in the new Cardinals Stadium.\n\n\nWith 11:28 left in the first quarter of play, Matt Turk kicked a 31-yard punt giving the Cardinals the ball on the Saint Louis 45. Nine plays later, Kurt Warner threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald.

Yet, on the third play of the drive, Warner fumbled the snap and the Rams' Will Witherspoon recovered the ball. The Rams ran the clock out and won the game 16\u201314.[14][15]\n\n\nRookie Victor Adeyanju got his first start in the game, replacing Anthony Hargrove who did not show up for meetings and practices.

The Rams responded with Bulger and Holt completing a 67-yard TD pass. The Seahawks won as Brown kicked a 54-yard field goal as time ran out, giving Seattle a three-game winning streak against St. Louis. This game was marred by controversy as the 10-second run-off rule did not apply on the last play of the game, giving Josh Brown the chance to win the game. With the loss, the Rams headed into their bye week 4\u20132.\n\n\n\n### Week 8: at San Diego Chargers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rams\n | 0\n | 7\n | 3\n | 14 | **24** |\n| **Chargers** | 14\n | 0\n | 10\n | 14 | **38** |\n\n\n*at Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, California*\nComing off of their bye week, the Rams flew to Qualcomm Stadium for their Week 8 match-up with the San Diego Chargers.

In the third quarter, things started to get ugly for St. Louis as Chargers free safety Marlon McCree returned a fumble 79 yards for a touchdown. The Rams responded with kicker Jeff Wilkins nailing a 34-yard field goal, yet Chargers kicker Nate Kaeding made a 31-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, it was back and forth with touchdowns.

In the second quarter, things got worse for the Rams as QB Damon Huard completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, while kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 42-yard field goal. St. Louis got on the board with RB Steven Jackson getting a 2-yard TD run, yet Huard and Gonzalez hooked up with each other again on a 25-yard TD strike.

The team attempted to improve upon their 8\u20138 record in 2006 and were looking to return to the playoffs after narrowly missing them. They failed to do so, finishing with a 7\u20139 record.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Coaching changes[edit]\n\n\nHead coach Marvin Lewis entered his fifth year with the Bengals. He was joined by offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski and defensive coordinator Chuck Bresnahan.\n\n\n\n### Personnel moves[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Offseason personnel moves\n |\n| --- |\n| Transaction | Position | Name | To/From\n |\n| --- | Safety | Kevin Kaesviharn | To New Orleans Saints |\n| --- | Guard | Eric Steinbach | To Cleveland Browns |\n| --- | Linebacker | Brian Simmons | To New Orleans Saints |\n| --- | Tight end | Tony Stewart | To Oakland Raiders |\n| --- | Linebacker | Marcus Wilkins | To Atlanta Falcons |\n| --- | Wide receiver | Kelly Washington | To New England Patriots |\n| --- | Defensive tackle | Shaun Smith | To Cleveland Browns |\n| Retired | Center | Rich Braham | Retirement\n |\n| --- | Cornerback | Tory James | To New England Patriots |\n| --- | Defensive tackle | Sam Adams | To Denver Broncos |\n| Released | Linebacker | A.

In May, it was reported he failed a drug test as part of his parole agreement but shortly after the announcement was made it was recanted by the Kentucky police department.[3]\n\n\nOdell Thurman, another NFL player currently under contract with the Bengals has had legal troubles and still appears to be in trouble with the Bengals as well. Head coach Marvin Lewis repeatedly avoided or refused to speak about his status with the team after Thurman was suspended for all of 2006.[4] When Thurman applied for reinstatement in July 2007 he was denied and was further suspended the entire 2007\u201308 season. The exact reason for the extension was not specified by the league but many suspect it had to do with a drunk-driving incident earlier that same month.[5] His suspension prompted Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge John Burlew to call the NFL officials \"Hypocrites\" for promoting alcohol sales and consumption during games but punishing players for drinking.\n\n\n\n### Off-field incidents[edit]\n\n\nLevi Jones was involved in an altercation with linebacker Joey Porter of the Miami Dolphins.[6] Allegedly Porter and some others ambushed Levi, physically assaulted and robbed him. Porter was charged with a misdemeanor for assault. Jones characterized the incident as a \"cowardly assault\".\n\n\nAJ Nicholson was arrested for the second time in as many years but for domestic violence. His wife dropped the charges but due to statutory state laws the state continued to press charges. On the day his arrest was announced he was released a few hours later by the Bengals.[7]\n\n\n\n### Important injuries[edit]\n\n\nDavid Pollack, injured last season with a broken neck vertebrae spent the season in rehab with hopes of returning in the 2008\u201309 season. Pollack later announced his retirement from the NFL.[8]\n\n\nKenny Irons, the 2nd round draft pick, experienced a serious knee injury during a preseason game against the Detroit Lions, which forced him onto injured reserve for his rookie year.[9]\n\n\nChris Perry experienced another injury which threatens to keep him out the entire season. In August, he was placed on the physically unable to perform list, meaning he had to miss at least six games. In November, Bengals announced that he would remain on the list for the rest of the season.[10]\n\n\nEric Henderson fractured his wrist during the preseason against the New Orleans Saints and was put on injured reserve for the rest of the season.[11]\n\n\n\n## Preseason games[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shayne Graham kicks an extra point against the Atlanta Falcons in preseason, August 27, 2007\nIn the previous preseason the Bengals went 4\u20130. The Bengals 2007 preseason run ended at 1\u20133, with its final victory the game against Indianapolis in which neither Carson Palmer nor Peyton Manning came prepared to play.\n\n\nThe preseason started off with a loss to the Detroit Lions at their dome. The big focus was the limited showdown and relationship between Palmer and his former mentor Jon Kitna. The Bengals' starting team did not score a touchdown in their possessions, walking away with 2 Shayne Graham field goals and a huge time of possession advantage before they were benched. The Lions' starters did not score a TD during their possessions during that same time. In this game the second-round draft pick, Kenny Irons, experienced his season-ending injury. Detroit went on to win the game.\n\n\nThe second game was against the New Orleans Saints. Again, the starting Bengals offense failed to score a TD and settled for several Shane Graham field goals. LB Henderson suffered a season-ending wrist injury late in the game.\n\n\nThe third game was at the home of the Atlanta Falcons on a Monday night. The starting Bengals played until the 3rd quarter and scored two touchdowns to end their drought. Shayne Graham was injured on a kickoff during an attempted tackle and did not return to kick any PATs or kickoffs, which meant the Bengals made a conversion attempt on 4th down and attempted a 2-point try. Atlanta's starting team, led by Joey Harrington since Vick's legal troubles will keep him from the team, also managed two touchdowns. The Bengals went on to lose the game.\n\n\nTheir fourth and final game, also their only preseason win, took place on August 31. Neither starting quarterback came prepared to play; though Palmer at least wore his uniform, while Manning dressed up in a Colts polo. Cincinnati scored 14 points in the 3rd quarter, with no score coming from the orange jerseys before or after that quarter. Indianapolis scored 6 in the 4th quarter, falling 8 points short of victory.\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2007 Cincinnati Bengals staff**\n|  | **Front office**\n* President \u2013 Mike Brown\n* Executive vice president \u2013 Katie Blackburn\n* Vice president \u2013 John Sawyer\n* Vice president \u2013 Troy Blackburn\n* Senior vice president of player personnel \u2013 Pete Brown\n* Vice president of player personnel \u2013 Paul Brown\n* Director of football operations \u2013 Jim Lippincott\n* Director of player personnel \u2013 Duke Tobin\n* Scouting consultants \u2013 John Cooper, Bill Tobin\n\n**Head coaches**\n* Head coach \u2013 Marvin Lewis\n* Assistant head coach/offensive line \u2013 Paul Alexander\n\n**Offensive coaches**\n* Offensive coordinator \u2013 Bob Bratkowski\n* Quarterbacks \u2013 Ken Zampese\n* Running backs \u2013 Jim Anderson\n* Wide receivers \u2013 Mike Sheppard\n* Tight ends \u2013 Jonathan Hayes\n* Assistant offensive line \u2013 Bob Surace\n |  |  | **Defensive coaches*** Defensive coordinator \u2013 Chuck Bresnahan\n* Defensive line \u2013 Jay Hayes\n* Linebackers \u2013 Ricky Hunley\n* Defensive backs \u2013 Kevin Coyle\n* Assistant defensive backs \u2013 Louie Cioffi\n\n**Special teams coaches**\n* Special teams \u2013 Darrin Simmons\n* Assistant special teams/assistant linebackers \u2013 Paul Guenther\n\n**Strength and conditioning**\n* Strength and conditioning \u2013 Chip Morton\n* Assistant strength and conditioning \u2013 Ray Oliver\n |\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2007 Cincinnati Bengals final roster**\n|  |\n|  | **Quarterbacks*** 11 Ryan Fitzpatrick\n* 9 Carson Palmer\n* 3 *Jeff Rowe*\n\n**Running backs**\n* 31 Jeremi Johnson FB\n* 32 Rudi Johnson\n* 33 Kenny Watson\n* 35 Quincy Wilson\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* 83 Antonio Chatman PR\n* 15 Chris Henry\n* 16 Glenn Holt KR\n* 84 T.

Monday Night home opener, the Bengals and their offensive firepower began their 40th Anniversary season in Game 1 of the Monday Night Football doubleheader against the defending AFC North champion Baltimore Ravens, with last year's top defense. In the first quarter, Cincinnati managed to cash in on a Raven fumble with QB Carson Palmer completing a 39-yard TD pass to WR Chad Johnson (whose TD celebration was on the sideline, in the form of a Hall of Fame jacket.) Later, the Bengals managed to turn another fumble recovery into points as kicker Shayne Graham kicked a 23-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Baltimore finally managed to score with RB Musa Smith getting a 6-yard TD run. Cincinnati responded with Graham kicking a 40-yard field goal, while Ravens kicker Matt Stover ended the half with a 36-yard field goal.\n\n\nIn the third quarter, the Bengals defense struck big, as OLB Landon Johnson recovered a McNair fumble and returned the ball 34 yards for a touchdown, along with the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore took the lead with Stover getting a 23-yard field goal, while Safety Ed Reed returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown. Cincinnati regained the lead by turning an interception into a score as Palmer completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh (followed by a successful 2-point conversion by RB Rudi Johnson). After the Ravens managed to recover a Bengal fumble on Cincinnati's next drive, Baltimore had one final chance. Eventually, the Bengals held their ground and won.\n\n\nThe Bengals defense had a total of 6 takeaways while the offense only turned over the ball twice. The game was relatively close in score with the final chance to tie up the game coming with a bit more than one minute left on the game clock. The defense held Baltimore out successfully scoring the tying touchdown after they had \"goal to go\" for 8 consecutive plays (after penalties extended their opportunities). Two Bengals linemen, Willie Anderson and Levi Jones, did not play most of this game due to injuries.\n\n\nWith the win, Cincinnati began its season at 1\u20130.\n\n\n\n#### Scoring summary[edit]\n\n\nQ1 \u2013 CIN \u2013 8:38 \u2013 39-yard TD pass from Carson Palmer to Chad Johnson (kick failed) (CIN 6\u20130)\n\n\nQ1 \u2013 CIN \u2013 4:07 \u2013 Shayne Graham 23-yard FG (CIN 9\u20130)\n\n\nQ2 \u2013 BAL \u2013 11:56 \u2013 Musa Smith 6-yard TD run (Matt Stover kick) (CIN 9\u20137)\n\n\nQ2 \u2013 CIN \u2013 1:07 \u2013 Shayne Graham 40-yard FG (CIN 12\u20137)\n\n\nQ2 \u2013 BAL \u2013 0:06 \u2013 Matt Stover 36-yard FG (CIN 12\u201310)\n\n\nQ3 \u2013 CIN \u2013 8:57 \u2013 Landon Johnson 34-yard fumble return TD (Graham kick) (CIN 19\u201310)\n\n\nQ4 \u2013 BAL \u2013 14:05 \u2013 Matt Stover 23-yard FG (CIN 19\u201313)\n\n\nQ4 \u2013 BAL \u2013 12:25 \u2013 Ed Reed 63-yard punt return TD (Stover kick) (BAL 20\u201319)\n\n\nQ4 \u2013 CIN \u2013 8:53 \u2013 7-yard TD pass from Carson Palmer to T.

Playing Ohio state rivals Cleveland Browns, the defense looked the exact opposite as they did in week one. Browns quarterback Derek Anderson started and threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game.[12] Jamal Lewis had 215 yards rushing with one touchdown and the Browns had two receivers with over 100 yards, Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. The Bengals offense tried their best to keep the team in the game, however, as Carson Palmer threw for 6 TD's and Chad Johnson caught for 209 yards.\n\n\nThe game started out slowly in the first quarter but the second quarter saw a combined 35 points scored. It was close in the end, when the Bengals started a drive with under one minute left. They managed to get the ball to the 50-yard line when Carson Palmer was intercepted by Leigh Bodden on an intended pass for Chad Johnson. This game ended up being the eighth highest scoring game in NFL history, but not the highest scoring game between these two teams. In 2004, the Bengals beat the Browns 58\u201348 for the second-most combined points.

The team finished the season with 4 wins, 11 losses, and 1 tie, and missing out of the playoffs for the 3rd consecutive year.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Coaching changes[edit]\n\n\nThis season marked head coach Marvin Lewis's sixth year with the Bengals. His offensive coordinator, Bob Bratkowski, remained with the team, but his defensive coordinator from 2007 to 2008, Chuck Bresnahan, was not retained. He was replaced by Mike Zimmer and Jeff FitzGerald replaced Ricky Hunley as linebacker coach.\n\n\n\n### Season theme[edit]\n\n\nTypically Lewis has had a theme for the upcoming season for the team to rally around. For the 2008 season it was \"Now\"[1]\n\n\n\n### Departures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Bengals visit the New York Giants at Giants Stadium, September 21\n* Madieu Williams, Safety signed with the Minnesota Vikings.\n* Justin Smith, Defensive end signed with the San Francisco 49ers.\n* Landon Johnson, Linebacker signed with the Carolina Panthers.\n* Willie Anderson, the long time Offensive Lineman was released and signed by the division rival Baltimore Ravens.\n* Rudi Johnson was released and signed by the Detroit Lions.\n* Ahmad Brooks, Linebacker, who was allegedly involved in an assault for punching a woman in the face late April, was released before the season began.\n* David Pollack, who was injured during his second season in the NFL with the Bengals and suffered paralysis, declined to return to football and officially retired.\n* Chris Henry was released from the team on the same day a press release in the local paper announced his alleged involvement in an assault occurring within Cincinnati. A few weeks after Marvin Lewis made the public declaration that Henry would never play for the Bengals again he was re-signed. He was ineligible to play the first 4 regular season games as punishment for his involvement with criminal charges against him which were dropped before his reinstatement.\n* Odell Thurman, a linebacker suspended for two consecutive years, was declared eligible to return to the NFL. He was then waived in May when Lewis cited that they had not seen enough of Odell to evaluate him properly. Less than a month later Odell was indefinitely suspended from the NFL for violating their substance abuse policy.\n\n\n### Signings[edit]\n\n\n* Ben Utecht, a tight end previously with the Indianapolis Colts\n* Antwan Odom, a defensive end previously with the Tennessee Titans\n* Doug Gabriel, a wide receiver previously with the Oakland Raiders. He was released from the Bengals on May 29, 2008.\n\n\n### NFL Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 NFL Draft\n\nThe Bengals gained an additional four picks for compensation of losing certain players.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **2008 Cincinnati Bengals draft** |\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position\n | College\n | Notes\n |\n| 1\n | 9\n | Keith Rivers\u00a0 | Linebacker | USC |  |\n| 2\n | 46\n | Jerome Simpson\u00a0 | Wide receiver | Coastal Carolina |  |\n| 3\n | 77\n | Pat Sims\u00a0 | Defensive tackle | Auburn |  |\n| 3\n | 97\n | Andre Caldwell\u00a0 | Wide receiver\n | Florida | compensatory selection |\n| 4\n | 112\n | Anthony Collins\u00a0 | Offensive tackle | Kansas |  |\n| 5\n | 145\n | Jason Shirley\u00a0 | Defensive tackle\n | Fresno State |  |\n| 6\n | 177\n | Corey Lynch\u00a0 | Safety | Appalachian State |  |\n| 6\n | 207\n | Matt Sherry\u00a0 | Tight end | Villanova | compensatory selection\n |\n| 7\n | 244\n | Angelo Craig\u00a0 | Defensive end | Cincinnati | compensatory selection\n |\n| 7\n | 246\n | Mario Urrutia\u00a0 | Wide receiver\n | Louisville | compensatory selection\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Made roster\u00a0\u00a0 |\n\n\n[2]\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2008 Cincinnati Bengals final roster**\n|  |\n|  | **Quarterbacks*** 11 Ryan Fitzpatrick\n* 9 Carson Palmer\n* 5 *Jordan Palmer*\n\n**Running backs**\n* 32 Cedric Benson\n* 39 *James Johnson*\n* 23 Chris Perry\n* 33 Kenny Watson\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* 87 Andre Caldwell KR\n* 15 Chris Henry\n* 16 Glenn Holt KR\n* 84 T.

In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Ravens WR Mark Clayton turned a double reverse play into a 42-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Bengals continued to struggle as kicker Matt Stover gave Baltimore a 21-yard field goal. Cincinnati would reply as kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 43-yard field goal. However, in the third quarter, the Bengals continued to show their dismal defense as Ravens QB Joe Flacco got a 38-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally as CB Johnathan Joseph returned a fumble 65 yards for a touchdown. However, Baltimore's defense stiffened and held on for the win.\n\n\nWith the loss, Cincinnati began their season at 0\u20131.

At the beginning of the game the winds were marked at 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) and picked up intensity as the game continued, with gusts to hurricane force at times due to the passage of the remnants of Hurricane Ike. After a scoreless first quarter, Cincinnati trailed as Titans RB LenDale White got a 1-yard TD run. The Bengals would respond with RB Chris Perry getting his first career TD on a 13-yard run. However, Tennessee would begin its domination with QB Kerry Collins completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Justin Gage. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as kicker Rob Bironas nailed a 34-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Titans sealed the win with LB Keith Bulluck blocking and recovering a punt within Cincy's endzone for a touchdown.\n\n\nDuring the game, the wind was such a factor that it aided the Titan's punter who, with a quick 1-step drop, kicked a punt travelling 70 yards past scrimmage before hitting the ground. It appeared to contribute to difficulties with short passes and long snaps.\n\n\nWith the loss, the Bengals fell to 0\u20132. It became the team's first 0-2 start since 2003.\n\n\n\n### Week 3: at New York Giants[edit]\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | OT | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bengals | 3 | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0 | **23** |\n| **Giants** | 0 | 10 | 3 | 10 | 3 | **26** |\n\n\n*at Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey*\n\n\n\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0pm EST\n* **Game weather**: 76\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C) (Sunny)\n* **Game attendance**: 79,276\n* **Referee**: Jeff Triplette\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Greg Gumbel & Dan Dierdorf\n\nStarters Ben Utecht, Johnathan Joseph, & Dexter Jackson, were inactive for the game due to injuries.\n\n\nTrying to snap their two-game losing skid, the Bengals flew to Giants Stadium for a Week 3 matchup with the defending Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants.

However, in overtime, New York came out on top as Carney nailing the game-winning 22-yard field goal.\n\n\nWith the loss, the Bengals fell to 0\u20133 as they prepared to face the Cleveland Browns the next game who were also 0\u20133. This was the team's first 0-3 start since 2003.\n\n\n\n* ![Cincinnati on defense in week 3](image)\n\nCincinnati on defense in week 3\n* ![Eli Manning in the shotgun](image)\n\nEli Manning in the shotgun\n* ![Manning passing against Cincinnati](image)\n\nManning passing against Cincinnati\n* ![New York huddle against Cincinnati](image)\n\nNew York huddle against Cincinnati\n* ![The Bengals on offense at New York](image)\n\nThe Bengals on offense at New York\n* ![The Giants offensive line](image)\n\nThe Giants offensive line\n* ![A New York 2nd down play](image)\n\nA New York 2nd down play\n* ![Carson Palmer is sacked](image)\n\nCarson Palmer is sacked\n\n\n### Week 4: vs. Cleveland Browns[edit]\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Browns** | 3 | 0 | 0 | 17 | **20** |\n| Bengals | 0 | 6 | 0 | 6 | **12** |\n\n\n*at Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio*\n\n\n\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0pm EDT\n* **Game weather**: 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C) (Mostly Sunny)\n* **Game attendance**: 65,541\n* **Referee**: Jerome Boger\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Kevin Harlan & Rich Gannon\n\nStill searching for their first win, the Bengals went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cleveland Browns in Round 1 of 2008's Battle of Ohio.

In the fourth quarter, Jacksonville began to rally as Scobee nailed a 26-yard field goal, FB Montell Owens returned the fumbled kickoff 18 yards for a touchdown, and RB Maurice Jones-Drew got a 1-yard TD pass. Fortunately, the Bengals' defense prevented the Jaguars from getting the 2-point conversion, allowing Cincinnati to finally get its first win of the season.\n\n\nWith the win, not only did the Bengals go into their bye week at 1\u20138, the win also made the Lions the only winless NFL team (the same Lions that would go 0\u201316).\n\n\n\n### Week 11: vs. Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | OT | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Eagles | 0 | 3 | 7 | 3 | 0 | **13** |\n| Bengals | 0 | 10 | 3 | 0 | 0 | **13** |\n\n\n*at Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio*\n\n\n\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0pm EST\n* **Game weather**: 38\u00a0\u00b0F (3\u00a0\u00b0C) (cloudy)\n* **Game attendance**: 64,633\n* **Referee**: Tony Corrente\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(Fox)**: Kenny Albert, Daryl Johnston, and Tony Siragusa\n\nComing off their bye week, the Bengals stayed at home for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles.

From there on out, the defense prevented Cleveland from getting any kind of momentum.\n\n\nWith the win, the Bengals improved to 3\u201311\u20131.\n\n\n\n### Week 17: vs. Kansas City Chiefs[edit]\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chiefs | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | **6** |\n| **Bengals** | 3 | 10 | 0 | 3 | **16** |\n\n\n*at Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio*\n\n\n\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0pm EST\n* **Game weather**: 43\u00a0\u00b0F (6\u00a0\u00b0C) (Sunny)\n* **Game attendance**: 63,984\n* **Referee**: Bill Carollo\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Bill Macatee & Steve Beuerlein\n\nComing off their divisional road win over the Browns, the Bengals went home, donned their alternate uniforms again, and closed out their season with a Week 17 duel with the Kansas City Chiefs.

In the second quarter, the Bengals would increase their lead as running back Cedric Benson got a 2-yard touchdown run, followed by Graham's 30-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, Cincinnati wrapped up its dominating day with Graham's 43-yard field goal. The Chiefs would respond with quarterback Tyler Thigpen completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez (with a failed 2-point conversion).\n\n\nWith the win, the Bengals finished their season at 4\u201311\u20131.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Bengals-Texans game was moved from Week 10 to Week 8 to accommodate schedule changes needed as a result of damage to Reliant Stadium as a result of Hurricane Ike.[3]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Now\" by Geoff Hobson on May 21, 2008\n2. **^** \"2008 Cincinnati Bengals draftees\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

They are members of the Eastern Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Bills franchise was formed in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), before joining the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL merger of 1970.[1]\n\n\nThere have been 19\u00a0head coaches for the Bills franchise. Buster Ramsey became the first head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 1960, serving for two seasons before being fired by Bills owner Ralph Wilson after the 1961 season.[2] In terms of tenure, Marv Levy has coached more games (182) and seasons (12) than any other coach in franchise history. He coached the Bills to four straight AFC Championships from 1990 to 1993, but failed to lead the team to a victory in the Super Bowl. One of Levy's predecessors, Lou Saban, who coached the team on two occasions, led the team to the victories in the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965. Three Bills coaches\u2014Saban, Levy and Chuck Knox\u2014have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization.[3] Levy and Jim Ringo are the only Bills coaches to have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\nThere have been six \"interim\" head coaches in Bills history. First, in 1968, head coach Joe Collier was fired two games into the season and replaced by Bills personnel director Harvey Johnson.[4] Johnson did not serve as head coach the following season. Then, five games into the 1976 season, Saban unexpectedly resigned as head coach. He was replaced by Ringo, the team's offensive line coach.[5] Ringo returned to coach the team again in the 1977 season. In October 1985, Kay Stephenson was fired and replaced by assistant head coach Hank Bullough.[5] Just over a year later, Bullough was himself fired and replaced by Marv Levy, who had previously served as coach of the Kansas City Chiefs.[6] Levy would then serve as Bills head coach for the next 12 seasons. In 2016, Anthony Lynn replaced Rex Ryan for the final game of the season.\n\n\nFollowing Levy's retirement, the Bills experienced limited success under a series of successive head coaches. Wade Phillips, the Bills defensive coordinator for the last three years under Levy, took over head coaching duties for the 1998 season. Phillips served as head coach for three seasons, making the playoffs in his first two (He was the last coach to lead the Bills to the playoffs until Sean McDermott became coach in 2017).[7] After Phillips' departure following the 2000 season, Gregg Williams was named head coach.[8] Williams served as coach for three seasons. At the end of the 2003 season, Williams' contract was not renewed.[9] Mike Mularkey was named as the new head coach for the 2004 season,[8] leading the Bills to their first winning season since 1999. The Bills experienced less success under Mularkey during 2005, and Mularkey resigned as head coach at the completion of the 2005 season.[9] The Bills then named Dick Jauron as their head coach for the 2006 season.[8] Jauron was the first coach since Phillips' dismissal with prior head coaching experience, having previously served as head coach of the Chicago Bears and interim head coach of the Detroit Lions. Jauron coached the Bills to three consecutive 7\u20139 seasons before being fired on November 17, 2009, nine games into the 2009 season. Defensive Coordinator Perry Fewell was named as the interim head coach, going 3-4 to finish out the season before all of the Bills coaching staff was fired on January 4, 2010. On January 19, 2010, the Bills named Chan Gailey as their next head coach; Gailey was fired on December 31, 2012.[10] In January 2013, Doug Marrone was appointed.[11] He exercised his option to leave in January 2015 following the change of ownership to Kim and Terrence Pegula and was replaced by Rex Ryan.[12] Rex Ryan was fired from the team on December 27, 2016.[13] Anthony Lynn served as interim head coach until January 11, when the team hired Sean McDermott to serve in the role on a permanent basis.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches [A] |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage [B] |\n| 00\u2020\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a coach\n |\n| 00\u2021\n | Elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a player\n |\n| 00\\*\n | Spent entire AFL/NFL head coaching career with the Bills\n |\n| 00\\*\\*\n | Two coaching tenures for Lou Saban\n |\n| 00^\n | Two coaching tenures for Harvey Johnson\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are accurate through the end of the 2022 NFL season.*\n\n\n| #\n | Image\n | Name\n | Term [C] | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Awards\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GC\n | W\n | L\n | T\n | Win%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Buster Ramsey\\*\n | 1960\u20131961\\*\n | 28\n | 11\n | 16\n | 1\n | .407\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [15] |\n| 2\n |  | Lou Saban\\*\\* [Total] | 1962\u20131965 | 56\n | 36\n | 17\n | 3\n | .679\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1964 UPI AFL Coach of the Year1965 UPI AFL Coach of the Year[3] | [16] |\n| 3\n |  | Joe Collier\\*\n | 1966\u20131968\\*[D] | 30\n | 13\n | 16\n | 1\n | .448\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |  | [17] |\n| 4\n |  | Harvey Johnson\\* ^[Tot.] | 1968\\*[D] | 12\n | 1\n | 10\n | 1\n | .091\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [18] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Rauch | 1969\u20131970 | 28\n | 7\n | 20\n | 1\n | .250\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [19] |\n| \u2013\n |  | Harvey Johnson\\* ^[Tot.] | 1971\\*\n | 14\n | 1\n | 13\n | 0\n | .071\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [18] |\n| \u2013\n |  | Lou Saban\\*\\* [Total] | 1972[E]\u20131976[F] | 61\n | 32\n | 28\n | 1\n | .533\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |  | [16] |\n| 6\n |  | Jim Ringo\\* \u2021\n | 1976[F]\u20131977\\*\n | 23\n | 3\n | 20\n | 0\n | .130\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [20] |\n| 7\n |  | Chuck Knox | 1978\u20131982 | 73\n | 37\n | 36\n | 0\n | .507\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1980 Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year1980 Sporting News NFL Coach of the Year1980 Pro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year[3] | [21] |\n| 8\n |  | Kay Stephenson\\*\n | 1983\u20131985\\*[G] | 36\n | 10\n | 26\n | 0\n | .277\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [22] |\n| 9\n |  | Hank Bullough | 1985[G]\u20131986[H] | 21\n | 4\n | 17\n | 0\n | .190\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [23] |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | Marv Levy \u2020\n | 1986[H]\u20131997 | 182\n | 112\n | 70\n | 0\n | .615\n | 19\n | 11\n | 8\n | 4 AFC championships (1990\u20131993) 1988 Sporting News NFL Coach of the Year1988 UPI NFL Coach of the Year1993 UPI NFL Coach of the Year[3] | [24] |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Wade Phillips | 1998\u20132000 | 48\n | 29\n | 19\n | 0\n | .604\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n |  | [25] |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Gregg Williams | 2001\u20132003\\*\n | 48\n | 17\n | 31\n | 0\n | .354\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [26] |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Mike Mularkey | 2004\u20132005 | 32\n | 14\n | 18\n | 0\n | .438\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [27] |\n| 14\n |  | Dick Jauron | 2006\u20132009[I] | 57\n | 24\n | 33\n | 0\n | .421\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [28] |\n| 15\n |  | Perry Fewell | 2009 [I] | 7\n | 3\n | 4\n | 0\n | .429\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [29] |\n| 16\n |  | Chan Gailey | 2010\u20132012 | 48\n | 16\n | 32\n | 0\n | .333\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [30] |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Doug Marrone | 2013\u20132014 | 32\n | 15\n | 17\n | 0\n | .469\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [31] |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | Rex Ryan | 2015\u20132016[K] | 31\n | 15\n | 16\n | 0\n | .484\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [32] |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Anthony Lynn | 2016 | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | .000\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |  | [33] |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Sean McDermott\\*\n | 2017\u2013present | 97\n | 62\n | 35\n | 0\n | .639\n | 7\n | 4\n | 5\n |  | [34] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n* **A** A running total of the number of coaches of the Bills. Thus, any coach who has two terms as head coach is only counted once.\n* **B** Before 1972, the AFL and NFL did not count ties in the calculations for winning percentage. After 1972, they were counted as a half-win and half-loss.[35]\n* **C** Each year is linked to an article about that NFL season.\n* **D** Joe Collier was fired two games into the 1968 season, after leading the Bills to an 0\u20132 record. The Bills personnel director, Harvey Johnson, was named interim head coach.[4]\n* **E** On December 21, 1971, Lou Saban joined the Bills again as head coach.

In 2013, the Titans traveled to Pittsburgh for their season opener against the rival Steelers. They got off to a strong start, scoring a touchdown and 3 field goals for a 16-2 lead, as the Steelers could only manage a safety. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers cut the Titans' lead to 16-9 after they scored a touchdown. However, Tennessee ran out the clock, ensuring themselves a victory. With the convincing win, the Titans started the season at 1-0, but since the Colts beat the Raiders, 21-17, and the Texans later defeated the Chargers, 31-28, Tennessee tied for 1st place in the AFC South, since the Jacksonville Jaguars were humiliated, 28-2, at home by the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\n\n#### Week 2: at Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\n**Week Two: Tennessee Titans at Houston Texans\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | OT | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Titans | 7 | 3 | 0 | 14 | 0 | **24** |\n| **Texans** | 7 | 0 | 7 | 10 | 6 | **30** |\n\n\n*at Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 15\n* **Game time**: 12:00 p.m. CDT\n* **Game weather**: Played indoors (retractable roof closed)\n* **Game attendance**: 71,718\n* **Referee**: Jeff Triplette\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Kevin Harlan and Solomon Wilcots\n* Recap, Game book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* \n\n**Second quarter**\n* \n\n**Third quarter**\n* \n\n**Fourth quarter**\n | **Top passers**\n* TEN \u2013\n* HOU \u2013\n\n**Top rushers**\n* TEN \u2013\n* HOU \u2013\n\n**Top receivers**\n* TEN \u2013\n* HOU \u2013\n\n**Top tacklers**\n* TEN \u2013\n* HOU \u2013\n\n\n |\n |\n\n#### Week 3: vs. San Diego Chargers[edit]\n\n\n**Week Three: San Diego Chargers at Tennessee Titans\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chargers | 7 | 3 | 7 | 0 | **17** |\n| **Titans** | 0 | 10 | 0 | 10 | **20** |\n\n\n*at LP Field, Nashville, Tennessee*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 22\n* **Game time**: 12:00 p.m. CDT\n* **Game weather**: 75\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u00a0\u00b0C), (Sunny)\n* **Game attendance**: 69,143\n* **Referee**: Tony Corrente\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Ian Eagle and Dan Fouts\n* Recap, Game book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* \n\n**Second quarter**\n* \n\n**Third quarter**\n* \n\n**Fourth quarter**\n | **Top passers**\n* SD \u2013\n* TEN \u2013\n\n**Top rushers**\n* SD \u2013\n* TEN \u2013\n\n**Top receivers**\n* SD \u2013\n* TEN \u2013\n\n**Top tacklers**\n* SD \u2013\n* TEN \u2013\n\n\n |\n |\n\nFor the first time since 1992 the Titans franchise defeated the Chargers, winning on a 34-yard touchdown throw from Jake Locker to Justin Hunter with 15 seconds to go.

Following a slow 1st quarter, Washington got on the board first with their only scoring play of the game in the 2nd quarter. D. Young rushed for 1 yard for a touchdown, but K. Forbath's extra point was blocked. With the score, Washington led 6\u20130 with 6:11 left in the 2nd. Houston quickly responded with a Fitzpatrick 76 yard pass to Hopkins; with the extra point from Bullock, the Texans lead 7\u20136 with 4:28 left in the 2nd.

With 13:19 left to play, Foster fumbled the ball at the Washington 8. Washington also couldn't capitalize on their turnover following numerous rushing plays that resulted in 4th and 17.

Following the 2 minute warning, Bullock kicked a 42-yard field goal to extend the Texans' lead to 17\u20136. The Redskins failed to score on their next possession, giving Houston the ball back with 1:14 left.\n\n\n\n##### Game notes[edit]\n\n\nWith the win, the Texans started their season 1\u20130 and snapped their franchise-worst 14-game losing streak.

At the half, Houston was up 17\u20130.\n\n\nOakland received the ball to start the 2nd half, managing to get down to the Houston 38. Swearinger fumbled the ball (twice) before it was picked up by Joseph and returned for 49 yards to the Oakland 21. The Texans again capitalized on the turnover, this time getting a touchdown following a Fitzpatrick pass to Hopkins. Houston lead 24\u20130 with 8:34 left in the 3rd. After Oakland received the ball back they were hit with a 10-yard penalty, forcing a 2nd and 20. Oakland failed to get over the penalty, punting the ball on 4th and 14.

After the Raiders got the ball back, the marched down the field to the Houston 39, before the end of the 3rd. With Oakland still yet to score, Houston lead 27\u20130.\n\n\nOakland's drive stayed alive after they converted on a 4th and 1. Another \"saving grace\" came after a defensive holding penalty for 10 yards gave the Raiders a 1st down. McFadden's 1 yard run finally put Oakland on the board, trailing 7\u201327 with 14:07 left to play. The Raiders kicked the ball back to the Texans, who ate up as much clock as possible with numerous running plays. Houston ended their drive with a 46-yard field goal from Bullock, giving them a 30\u20137 lead. On Oakland's next possession, Carr's pass was intercepted by Reed at the Oakland 15 and ran it to the 11. Going into a 4th and 8, Bullock attempted a 27-yard field goal, but it was blocked. Following the blocked kick, the Raiders started at their 17 before getting another touchdown to trail 14\u201330 with 0:14 left. Oakland attempted an onside kick, but went out of bounds, but two offsetting penalties gave the Raiders another chance. On the second attempt, the Texans recovered the ball to win the game 30\u201314.\n\n\n\n##### Game notes[edit]\n\n\nWith the win, the Texans started a season 2\u20130 for the fifth year in a row and matched their win total from the 2013 season.

J. Wilcox (traded to Pittsburgh Steelers), former New York Jets kicker Nick Folk, and veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick.\n\n\nThe team's Week 1 game against the Miami Dolphins was rescheduled to November 19 due to Hurricane Irma. Week 11 was originally the two teams' bye week. Week 1 would become the bye week for both teams and they would not play until Week 2. This was first time since the Arizona Cardinals in 2001 in which a team had a bye week in Week 1.\n\n\nThe Buccaneers were hampered with poor performance and an early kicking situation, as they failed to improve or match their 9\u20137 record from the previous season. After a loss to the Detroit Lions on December 10, 2017, they were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs with a 4\u20139 record. The Bucs finished the season 5-11. This was their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance, with their last being in the 2007 season. Also, the Bucs finished last in the NFC South for the seventh time in nine seasons.\n\n\nThe preseason was documented on HBO's *Hard Knocks*.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Signings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Position | Player | Age | 2016 Team | Contract\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WR | DeSean Jackson | 30 | Washington Redskins | 3 years, $33.5\u00a0million\n |\n| DE | Chris Baker | 29 | Washington Redskins | 3 years, $15.7\u00a0million\n |\n| FS | J.J.

Running back Doug Martin returned from his suspension, and had a productive showing, rushing for 74 yards on 14 carries and scoring a touchdown. However, the Tampa Bay offense mostly struggled through the first three-quarters. Meanwhile, Buccaneers kicker Nick Folk struggled mightily, missing on all three of his field goal attempts. Late in the fourth quarter, Jameis Winston threw a touchdown pass to tight end Cameron Brate, making the score 16\u201314 with just over two minutes left in regulation. After a failed onside kicked, the Patriots scored a field goal putting themselves up by five. The Buccaneers got the ball back with 1:10 remaining, and zero timeouts left. Winston drove the Buccaneers to the New England 18-yard line with 3 seconds to go. Winston's pass to O. J. Howard in the endzone as time expired fell incomplete, ending the team's six-game home winning streak. After missing six kicks since the Giants game (five field goals and one extra point), kicker Nick Folk was placed on injured reserve.\n\n\n\n#### Week 6: at Arizona Cardinals[edit]\n\n\n**Week Six: Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Arizona Cardinals\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Buccaneers | 0 | 0 | 6 | 27 | **33** |\n| **Cardinals** | 14 | 10 | 7 | 7 | **38** |\n\n\n*at University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: October 15\n* **Game time**: 4:05\u00a0pm.

Howard, the game was tied, 20-20. With just over 3 minutes remaining in regulation, another touchdown pass by Winston, this time a diving catch just inbounds by Mike Evans gave the Buccaneers a 27\u201320 lead.

They would also beat the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2 and nearly beat the Pittsburgh Steelers during Week 3, both with Fitzpatrick as starting quarterback. However despite their 2\u20130 start, the first time since 2010 the Bucs began a three game skid with Fitzpatrick being benched for Jameis Winston in Week 4 against the Chicago Bears. Winston started the next three game before being benched in favor for Fitzpatrick against the Cincinnati Bengals. Fitzpatrick went on to start three more games until being benched again for Winston against the New York Giants where Winston would remain the starter for the rest of the season. Despite the Buccaneers leading the league in total passing yards, they only managed to match their 5\u201311 record from the previous season and finished last in the NFC South for the eighth time in ten seasons. After their Week 15 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, the Buccaneers were eliminated from postseason contention for the 11th straight season. Fitzpatrick posted a 2\u22125 record while starting while Winston posted a 3\u22126 recording while starting. The team however set a then franchise record 396 points scored on the season.\n\n\nOn December 30, 2018, head coach Dirk Koetter was fired following a Week 17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## NFL draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 NFL Draft\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **2018 Tampa Bay Buccaneers draft** |\n| Round\n | Pick\n | Player\n | Position\n | College\n | Notes\n |\n| 1 | 12\n | Vita Vea\u00a0\\*\u00a0 | DT | Washington | From Cincinnati via Buffalo |\n| 2\n | 38\n | Ronald Jones II\u00a0 | RB | USC |  |\n| 2\n | 53\n | M.

|\n |\n\nTampa Bay started the 2018 season with Jameis Winston serving a three-game suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy. Ryan Fitzpatrick started as quarterback and led the Buccaneers to a 48\u201340 victory over division rival New Orleans. The 48 points scored tied a franchise record for most points scored in a game, with the Bucs also scoring 48 points in Super Bowl XXXVII. Also, the combined score of 88 points from both teams set an NFL record for the most points scored in Week 1. Fitzpatrick threw for 417 yards and 4 touchdown passes, and ran for another touchdown. The scoring frenzy started early after the Saints scored a touchdown on their first drive. The Buccaneers answered with a 58-yard touchdown reception by DeSean Jackson, followed by a 3-yard touchdown run by Fitzpatrick, for a 14\u201310 lead at the end of the first quarter. In the third quarter, Mike Evans caught a 50-yard touchdown, the second touchdown pass of 50 or more yards. The Buccaneers tied a franchise record with 48 points, and set a team record with 31 first half points. With under five minutes to go, Chandler Catanzaro missed a 44-yard field goal which would have broken the team record outright. Trailing 48\u201324, the Saints attempted a rally in the fourth quarter. Drew Brees led the Saints on two touchdown drives, and trimmed the deficit to 8 points with just over three minutes remaining. Facing a 3rd down & 11 at their own 24-yard line, Ryan Fitzpatrick scrambled 12 yards for a Buccaneers first down at the two-minute warning. The victory was secure as the Saints had no more time outs, and the Buccaneers took a knee three times to run out the clock.\n\n\n\n#### Week 2: vs. Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\n**Week Two: Philadelphia Eagles at Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Eagles | 0 | 7 | 7 | 7 | **21** |\n| **Buccaneers** | 7 | 13 | 7 | 0 | **27** |\n\n\n*at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 16\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0pm.

Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 402 yards and 4 touchdown passes, the first player in NFL history to throw for 400 yards and four touchdown passes in the first two weeks of the season. The game started out with a bang as Fitzpatrick threw a 75-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson on the first play of the game. Second-year tight end O. J. Howard also scored on a 75-yard touchdown pass later in the first half. The Buccaneers largest lead was 27-7 midway through the third quarter. The Eagles scored two touchdowns in the second half to make it a one-score game, but they were not able to score again. The Buccaneers ran the clock down to 19 seconds, giving the Eagles time to run only three plays. With three seconds left in regulation, a Nick Foles pass followed by series of desperation laterals ran out the clock, securing the win for Tampa Bay. With Atlanta defeating Carolina, the Buccaneers lead the NFC South, and remain the only team in the division with an undefeated record.\n\n\n\n#### Week 3: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]\n\n\n**Week Three: Pittsburgh Steelers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Steelers** | 6 | 24 | 0 | 0 | **30** |\n| Buccaneers | 7 | 3 | 3 | 14 | **27** |\n\n\n*at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 24\n* **Game time**: 8:15\u00a0pm.

Ryan Fitzpatrick threw three interceptions in the first half, one returned for a touchdown, as the Buccaneers went into halftime trailing 30\u201310. In the second half, Fitzpatrick lead a comeback throwing two touchdown passes, and Buccaneers closed to within three points late in the fourth quarter. However, the defense could not stop the Steelers offense and the clock ran out.

After Tannehill was traded, the Dolphins would go on to sign journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and trade for Arizona Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen. As he outplayed Rosen during training camp, Fitzpatrick started the majority of the season, with Rosen starting from Weeks 3 to 6.[7] On December 22, Fitzpatrick became the first Dolphins' quarterback since Dan Marino to pass for 400 yards and four touchdowns. Despite defeating the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 13, the Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention for the third consecutive year after the Pittsburgh Steelers won that same day.\n\n\nUltimately failing to improve on their 7\u20139 record from the previous season, the team started the season 0\u20137, but rallied to win five of their last nine games. Although the victories prevented the Dolphins from obtaining the first overall pick of the 2020 draft, they were able to select Tagovailoa, whose draft stock had fallen due to his injury.\n\n\nThis was the Dolphins' first season with exactly five wins since 1968 and their first since the league expanded to 16 games in 1978. It was also their first season winning fewer than six games since their franchise-worst 2007 season. Additionally, it was the Dolphins' first season since 2004 without long-time snapper John Denney, as he was released on September 2, 2019. Denney was the longest tenured player on the Dolphins' roster prior to his release, having been with the team since 2005. It made 5th-year wide receiver DeVante Parker the new longest-tenured player on the roster.\n\n\nThis season marked the first time since the 1997 Season that the Dolphins failed to have a pro bowler.\n\n\nAs of 2022, this is the last time the Dolphins had a losing season.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason coaching change[edit]\n\n\nThe Dolphins fired head coach Adam Gase on December 31, 2018, after the team missed the playoffs for a second-straight season and finished 2018 with a 7\u20139 record.[8] The Dolphins conducted interviews with several candidates such as team assistants Dowell Loggains and Darren Rizzi, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, and New England Patriots linebackers coach, defensive play caller, and long-time assistant Brian Flores. The team was primarily linked to Flores but had to wait to hire him until after the Patriots were out of the NFL playoffs due to league rules.[9] Flores served in several positions with the Patriots since their 2004 Super Bowl-winning season, beginning as a scout before getting promoted to Bill Belichick's coaching staff in 2008. Flores most recently served as New England's Linebackers' coach from 2016 to 2018, and was also part of three of their Super Bowl-winning squads (2014, 2016, and 2018), as well as the AFC-winning 2011 and 2017 squads. On February 4, 2019, the day after Super Bowl LIII, the team announced Flores as their thirteenth head coach.[10] Prior to his hiring by the Dolphins, Flores was also interviewed for the head coaching vacancies of teams such as the Denver Broncos, Cleveland Browns, and Green Bay Packers.[11] The Dolphins announced the majority of Flores' coaching staff on February 8, 2019, including Chad O'Shea as offensive coordinator, Patrick Graham as defensive coordinator, Danny Crossman as special teams coordinator, and former Indianapolis Colts/Detroit Lions head coach Jim Caldwell as assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach.[12] On July 29, 2019, just four days into Dolphins camp, Flores sent a quick message by firing the OL Coach Pat Flaherty whom he had hired in the spring and replacing him with team analyst Dave DeGuglielmo. Flores had deemed Flaherty to be ineffective in implementing the team\u2019s new system.[13]\n\n\n\n## Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 NFL Draft\n\n\n\n2019 Miami Dolphins Draft\n| Round | Selection | Player | Position | College\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 13\n | Christian Wilkins | DE | Clemson |\n| 2 | ***Traded to the Arizona Cardinals*** |\n| 3 | 78\n | Michael Deiter | G | Wisconsin |\n| 4 | ***Traded to the New Orleans Saints*** |\n| 5 | 151\n | Andrew Van Ginkel | LB | Wisconsin |\n| 6 | 202\n | Isaiah Prince | OT | Ohio State |\n| 7 | 233 | Chandler Cox | FB | Auburn |\n| 234 | Myles Gaskin | RB | Washington |\n\n\n### Draft Trades[edit]\n\n\n* The Miami Dolphins traded a conditional seventh-round selection to Detroit in exchange for defensive tackle Akeem Spence.[14]\n\n\n## Staff[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2019 Miami Dolphins staff**\n|  | **Front office**\n* Chairman/managing general partner \u2013 Stephen Ross\n* Vice chairman/partner \u2013 Bruce Beal\n* Vice chairman \u2013 Jorge Perez\n* Vice chairman \u2013 Don Shula\n* Vice chairman \u2013 Matt Higgins\n* Vice chairman, president, and CEO \u2013 Tom Garfinkel\n* General manager \u2013 Chris Grier\n* Assistant general manager \u2013 Marvin Allen\n* Vice president, football administration \u2013 Brandon Shore\n* Senior personnel executive \u2013 Reggie McKenzie\n* Co-director, player personnel \u2013 Adam Engroff\n* Co-director, player personnel \u2013 Anthony Hunt\n\n**Head coaches**\n* Head coach \u2013 Brian Flores\n* Assistant head coach/quarterbacks \u2013 Jim Caldwell (stepped down July 13, 2019)\n\n**Offensive coaches**\n* Offensive coordinator \u2013 Chad O'Shea\n* Assistant quarterbacks \u2013 Jerry Schuplinski\n* Running backs \u2013 Eric Studesville\n* Wide receivers \u2013 Karl Dorrell\n* Tight ends \u2013 George Godsey\n* Offensive line \u2013 Dave DeGuglielmo\n* Offensive line -

The Dolphins gave up 49 yards on the first play from scrimmage, and they subsequently allowed Baltimore to score on that same possession. The next drive, Ryan Fitzpatrick was picked off, which already put the Dolphins in an early hole. The Dolphins' misery continued when the Ravens scored right after another Fitzpatrick interception. The Dolphins and Ravens exchanged punts and Ravens' scores. After the series of exchanges, the Dolphins finally got on the board cutting the Ravens lead to 28\u20133. The Dolphins ended the first half down 42\u201310, with the Preston Williams touchdown play from Ryan Fitzpatrick. That was the last scoring play by the Dolphins. The Dolphins' defense showed no signs of improvement later in the game with the Ravens scoring on three more drives.

The Dolphins improved to 3\u20139 with the win but were eliminated from playoff contention thanks to the Steelers' victory that same day.\n\n\nThis game is famous for a trick play the Dolphins ran in the 2nd quarter. Down 10-7 with 4th and goal at the 1-yard line, the Dolphins audibled from a field goal formation to an offensive formation with Matt Haack in shotgun facing two rushers with no protection other than the center. The other linemen lined up in threes outside the numbers on both sides of the ball with a receiver behind them to make convoys. Kicker Jason Sanders lined up one-on-one in the left slot. Haack took the snap and immediately rolled to his left and the convoys started to block. The Eagles defenders engaged at the line of scrimmage but let Sanders slip behind the defense, and Haack flipped it to him for the score. The play was the first and, to date, only punter-to-kicker touchdown pass in NFL history.\n\n\n\n#### Week 14: at New York Jets[edit]\n\n\n**Week Fourteen: Miami Dolphins at New York Jets\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dolphins | 3 | 6 | 3 | 9 | **21** |\n| **Jets** | 0 | 16 | 0 | 6 | **22** |\n\n\n*at MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: December 8\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EST\n* **Game weather**: Mostly sunny, 41\u00a0\u00b0F (5\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 78,523\n* **Referee**: Craig Wrolstad\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Tom McCarthy, Jay Feely and Otis Livingston\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 22-yard field goal, 3:06. *Dolphins 3-0. **Drive: 16 plays, 92 yards, 8:11.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* NYJ - Robby Anderson 26-yard pass from Sam Darnold (kick failed), 13:45. *Jets 6-3. **Drive: 10 plays, 74 yards, 4:21.***\n* NYJ - Sam Ficken 37-yard field goal, 11:01. *Jets 9-3. **Drive: 7 plays, 25 yards, 2:36.***\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 25-yard field goal, 5:41. *Jets 9-6. **Drive: 10 plays, 67 yards, 5:20.***\n* NYJ - Demaryius Thomas 14-yard pass from Sam Darnold (Sam Ficken kick), 1:55. *Jets 16-6. **Drive: 7 plays, 77 yards, 3:46.***\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 28-yard field goal, 0:19. *Jets 16-9. **Drive: 8 plays, 65 yards, 1:36.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 31-yard field goal, 10:43. *Jets 16-12. **Drive: 9 plays, 62 yards, 4:17.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 53-yard field goal, 10:52. *Jets 16-15. **Drive: 8 plays, 45 yards, 3:51.***\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 48-yard field goal, 6:59. *Dolphins 18-16. **Drive: 5 plays, 36 yards, 2:18.***\n* NYJ - Sam Ficken 42-yard field goal, 4:05. *Jets 19-18. **Drive: 9 plays, 51 yards, 2:54.***\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 37-yard field goal, 1:33. *Dolphins 21-19. **Drive: 9 plays, 56 yards, 2:32.***\n* NYJ - Sam Ficken 44-yard field goal, 0:00. *Jets 22-21. **Drive: 7 plays, 49 yards, 1:33.***\n | **Top passers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Sam Darnold \u2013 20/36, 270 yards, 2 TD, INT\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 21/37, 245 yards, INT\n\n**Top rushers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Bilal Powell \u2013 19 rushes, 74 yards\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 7 rushes, 65 yards\n\n**Top receivers**\n* NYJ - Robby Anderson - 7 receptions, 117 yards, TD\n* MIA \u2013 Isaiah Ford \u2013 6 receptions, 92 yards\n\n\n |\n |\nOn a typically cold and windy December afternoon in New Jersey, the Dolphins just couldn't manage to reach the end zone all day.

With the loss the Dolphins fell to 3\u201310.\n\n\n#### Week 15: at New York Giants[edit]\n\n\n**Week Fifteen: Miami Dolphins at New York Giants\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dolphins | 0 | 10 | 3 | 7 | **20** |\n| **Giants** | 0 | 7 | 16 | 13 | **36** |\n\n\n*at MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: December 15\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EST\n* **Game weather**: Cloudy, 48\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 72,894\n* **Referee**: Jerome Boger\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Spero Dedes and Adam Archuleta\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* *No Scoring plays*\n\n**Second quarter**\n* MIA - DeVante Parker 20-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Jason Sanders kick), 9:03. *Dolphins 7-0. **Drive: 9 plays, 89 yards, 5:44.***\n* NYG - Golden Tate 51-yard pass from Eli Manning (Aldrick Rosas kick), 8:01. *Tied 7-7. **Drive: 3 plays, 75 yards, 1:92.***\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 24-yard field goal, 0:44. *Dolphins 10-7. **Drive: 7 plays, 22 yards, 0:36.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* NYG - Darius Slayton 5-yard pass from Eli Manning (Aldrick Rosas kick), 11:53. *Giants 14-10. **Drive: 6 plays, 70 yards, 3:07.***\n* MIA - Jason Sanders 47-yard field goal, 8:44. *Giants 14-13. **Drive: 5 plays, 22 yards, 1:23.***\n* NYG - Patrick Laird tackled in end zone by Sam Beal for a safety. *Giants 16-13.*\n* NYG - Saquon Barkley 1-yard run (Aldrick Rosas kick), 5:17. *Giants 23-13. **Drive: 3 plays, 40 yards, 1:03.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* NYG - Saquon Barkley 10-yard run (Aldrick Rosas kick), 14:54. *Giants 30-13. **Drive: 8 plays, 66 yards, 4:19.***\n* NYG - Javorius Allen 1-yard run (kick failed), 4:41. *Giants 36-13. **Drive: 5 plays, 44 yards, 1:54.***\n* MIA - DeVante Parker 29-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Jason Sanders kick), 1:54. *Giants 36-20. **Drive: 8 plays, 75 yards, 2:47.***\n | **Top passers**\n* NYG \u2013 Eli Manning \u2013 20/28, 283 yards, 2 TD, 3 INT\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 23/41, 279 yards, 2 TD\n\n**Top rushers**\n* NYG \u2013 Saquon Barkley \u2013 24 rushes, 112 yards, 2 TD\n* MIA \u2013 Patrick Laird \u2013 12 rushes, 46 yards\n\n**Top receivers**\n* NYG \u2013 Sterling Shepard \u2013 9 receptions, 111 yards\n* MIA \u2013 DeVante Parker \u2013 4 receptions, 72 yards, 2 TD\n\n\n |\n |\nThe Dolphins were seeking a win over the Giants for the first time since 2003.

Flores served in multiple roles with the Patriots after their 2004 Super Bowl-winning season, winning four Super Bowls and serving as linebackers coach from 2016 to 2018 and de facto defensive coordinator during 2018. The Dolphins' stunning victory sealed by a touchdown pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Mike Gesicki with 0:29 remaining was one of the biggest upsets of the season. The win combined with a Kansas City Chiefs win denied the Patriots a first-round playoff bye for the first time since 2009, and was the Dolphins' first win in Gillette Stadium since 2008. It also ended up being Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady's final regular season game in a Patriots' uniform, as the Patriots lost to the Tennessee Titans in the Wild Card playoffs the following week, and Brady went on to sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the offseason after 20 years with the Patriots.[28] Miami finished the season at 5\u201311.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n#### Division[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| AFC East |\n| --- |\n| * view\n* talk\n* edit\n | W | L | T | PCT | DIV | CONF | PF | PA | STK |\n| (3) New England Patriots | 12\n | 4\n | 0\n | .750\n | 5\u20131\n | 8\u20134\n | 420\n | 225\n | L1\n |\n| (5) Buffalo Bills | 10\n | 6\n | 0\n | .625\n | 3\u20133\n | 7\u20135\n | 314\n | 259\n | L2\n |\n| New York Jets | 7\n | 9\n | 0\n | .438\n | 2\u20134\n | 4\u20138\n | 276\n | 359\n | W2\n |\n| Miami Dolphins | 5\n | 11\n | 0\n | .313\n | 2\u20134\n | 4\u20138\n | 306\n | 494\n | W2\n |\n\n\n#### Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| AFC* v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| #\n | Team\n | Division\n | W | L | T | PCT | DIV | CONF | SOS | SOV | STK |\n| **Division leaders** |\n| 1\n | Baltimore Ravens | North\n | 14\n | 2\n | 0\n | .875\n | 5\u20131\n | 10\u20132\n | .494\n | .484\n | W12\n |\n| 2[a] | Kansas City Chiefs | West\n | 12\n | 4\n | 0\n | .750\n | 6\u20130\n | 9\u20133\n | .510\n | .477\n | W6\n |\n| 3[a] | New England Patriots | East\n | 12\n | 4\n | 0\n | .750\n | 5\u20131\n | 8\u20134\n | .469\n | .411\n | L1\n |\n| 4\n | Houston Texans | South\n | 10\n | 6\n | 0\n | .625\n | 4\u20132\n | 8\u20134\n | .520\n | .488\n | L1\n |\n| **Wild Cards** |\n| 5\n | Buffalo Bills | East\n | 10\n | 6\n | 0\n | .625\n | 3\u20133\n | 7\u20135\n | .461\n | .363\n | L2\n |\n| 6\n | Tennessee Titans | South\n | 9\n | 7\n | 0\n | .563\n | 3\u20133\n | 7\u20135\n | .488\n | .465\n | W1\n |\n| **Did not qualify for the postseason** |\n| 7\n | Pittsburgh Steelers | North\n | 8\n | 8\n | 0\n | .500\n | 3\u20133\n | 6\u20136\n | .502\n | .324\n | L3\n |\n| 8[b][c] | Denver Broncos | West\n | 7\n | 9\n | 0\n | .438\n | 3\u20133\n | 6\u20136\n | .510\n | .406\n | W2\n |\n| 9[c][d][e] | Oakland Raiders | West\n | 7\n | 9\n | 0\n | .438\n | 3\u20133\n | 5\u20137\n | .482\n | .335\n | L1\n |\n| 10[b][d][e] | Indianapolis Colts | South\n | 7\n | 9\n | 0\n | .438\n | 3\u20133\n | 5\u20137\n | .492\n | .500\n | L1\n |\n| 11[b][d] | New York Jets | East\n | 7\n | 9\n | 0\n | .438\n | 2\u20134\n | 4\u20138\n | .473\n | .402\n | W2\n |\n| 12[f] | Jacksonville Jaguars | South\n | 6\n | 10\n | 0\n | .375\n | 2\u20134\n | 6\u20136\n | .484\n | .406\n | W1\n |\n| 13[f] | Cleveland Browns | North\n | 6\n | 10\n | 0\n | .375\n | 3\u20133\n | 6\u20136\n | .533\n | .479\n | L3\n |\n| 14[g] | Los Angeles Chargers | West\n | 5\n | 11\n | 0\n | .313\n | 0\u20136\n | 3\u20139\n | .514\n | .488\n | L3\n |\n| 15[g] | Miami Dolphins | East\n | 5\n | 11\n | 0\n | .313\n | 2\u20134\n | 4\u20138\n | .484\n | .463\n | W2\n |\n| 16\n | Cincinnati Bengals | North\n | 2\n | 14\n | 0\n | .125\n | 1\u20135\n | 2\u201310\n | .553\n | .406\n | W1\n |\n| **Tiebreakers**[h] |\n| 1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kansas City finished ahead of New England based on head-to-head victory.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Denver finished ahead of Indianapolis and NY Jets based on conference record.

This was the fourth time in franchise history that the Dolphins failed to make the playoffs with ten wins\n\n\nThe Dolphins ranked 6th in defense this season.[1]\n\n\n\n## Season Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe Dolphins dedicated their 2020 season in memory of legendary Dolphins' head coach Don Shula, who died on May 4, 2020, at the age of 90, at his Indian Creek, Florida home. At both home and away games, the Dolphins wore patches bearing Shula's surname and the number 347, the number of Shula's all-time number of wins in his 32 years as an NFL head coach. Shula, the winningest coach in NFL history, served as Dolphins' head coach from 1970 to 1995 and had led the franchise to five Super Bowl appearances, winning back-to-back championships in 1972 and 1973. Famously, in 1972, Shula led the Dolphins to their first Super Bowl title, as well as the only perfect season by a team since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger.\n\n\nThe Dolphins improved on their 5\u201311 record from the previous season, following a Week 10 win over the Los Angeles Chargers. After beginning the season 1\u20133, the Dolphins established themselves as playoff contenders by winning five straight games and starting with a 6\u20133 record for the first time since 2001. They also started 8\u20134 for the first time since 2003. The team clinched their first winning season since 2016 after a Week 15 win over the Patriots, which eliminated the Pats from the playoffs for the first time since 2008. On December 26, the Dolphins clinched their first 10-win season since 2016 with a 26\u201325 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\n\nA significant factor in Miami's dramatic improvement over their 2019 season of 5\u201311 was the story of their defense. In 2019, the Dolphins allowed more points than any other team in the NFL. In 2020, only five teams allowed fewer points-per-game than the Dolphins.[2]\n\n\nHowever, despite the improvements, the Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention for the fourth consecutive year following a blowout loss to the Buffalo Bills and the Indianapolis Colts' victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 17, becoming the first team to miss the playoffs with 10+ wins since the 2015 Jets, which, coincidentally, were also led by Ryan Fitzpatrick. Despite their elimination from the playoffs, 5th-year cornerback Xavien Howard joined Antonio Cromartie as the only players since the 1970 merger to record at least 10 interceptions in a season, and was the most by a Dolphins player since Dick Westmoreland in 1967. The Dolphins also clinched the rights for the 3rd overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, which is one of the two first-round picks they received from trading Laremy Tunsil and Kenny Stills to the Houston Texans a season prior. The Dolphins had also finished the 2020 season by scoring a total of 404 points, which is their third highest-scoring total in a season in franchise history (the franchise's highest being 513 total points in 1984).\n\n\nThis season was also highlighted by the emergence of rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, the 5th pick in the 2020 Draft, who was named the Dolphins' starter in Week 8, after the team began 3\u20133 under the leadership of Ryan Fitzpatrick. As the Dolphins' starting quarterback, he went 6\u20133 and also became the fifth rookie quarterback since the 1970 merger to win his first three starts.\n\n\n\n## Signings[edit]\n\n\nThe Dolphins signed former Dallas Cowboys cornerback Byron Jones, former Philadelphia Eagles running back Jordan Howard, and former New England Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy. The Dolphins also picked up San Francisco 49ers' RB Matt Breida in a trade for a fifth-round draft pick which later became Colton McKivitz.\n\n\n\n## Free agent signings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Position\n |

October 2, 2016, and their first without Brady on the roster since January 2, 2000. The 2020 season opener featured quarterback Cam Newton taking the reins of the New England offense in his inaugural game as a member of the Patriots. Newton looked crisp in his first game in over a year as he scored twice on the ground in an offensive ground attack that compiled 217 yards rushing. Cam Newton scrambled for 75 yards on the ground and completed 15 of 19 passing, which left Miami's defense frustrated the entire day. Miami's offense struggled as well due to three interceptions thrown by veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no fans were in the stands and fake crowd noise was piped onto the playing field. With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 0\u20131.[14][15]\n\n\n\n#### Week 2: vs. Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\n**Week Two: Buffalo Bills at Miami Dolphins\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Bills** | 7 | 10 | 0 | 14 | **31** |\n| Dolphins | 7 | 3 | 3 | 15 | **28** |\n\n\n*at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 20\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EDT\n* **Game weather**: Cloudy, 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 11,075\n* **Referee**: Jerome Boger\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Spero Dedes and Adam Archuleta\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Reggie Gilliam 1-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 4:55 *Bills 7\u20130. **Drive: 11 plays, 97 yards, 5:19.***\n* MIA \u2013 DeVante Parker 2-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Jason Sanders kick), 0:38 *Tied 7\u20137. **Drive: 10 plays, 75 yards, 4:17.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Stefon Diggs 22-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 11:40 *Bills 14\u20137. **Drive: 5 plays, 84 yards, 2:58.***\n* BUF \u2013 Tyler Bass 39-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 2:30 *Bills 17\u20137. **Drive: 13 plays, 73 yards, 6:13.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 52-yard field goal, 0:02 *Bills 17\u201310. **Drive: 5 plays, 41 yards, 0:31.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 45-yard field goal, 11:18 *Bills 17\u201313. **Drive: 8 plays, 48 yards, 3:42.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Jordan Howard 2-yard run (Jason Sanders kick), 10:11 *Dolphins 20\u201317. **Drive: 10 plays, 44 yards, 5:13.***\n* BUF \u2013 Gabe Davis 6-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 5:55 *Bills 24\u201320. **Drive: 7 plays, 75 yards, 4:16.***\n* BUF \u2013 John Brown 46-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 3:09 *Bills 31\u201320. **Drive: 5 plays, 71 yards, 1:17.***\n* MIA \u2013 Mike Gesicki 8-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2013Preston Williams pass), 0:49 *Bills 31\u201328. **Drive: 9 plays, 75 yards, 2:20.***\n | **Top passers**\n* BUF \u2013 Josh Allen \u2013 24/35, 415 yards, 4 TD\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 31/47, 328 yards, 2 TD\n\n**Top rushers**\n* BUF \u2013 Devin Singletary \u2013 10 rushes, 56 yards\n* MIA \u2013 Myles Gaskin \u2013 7 rushes, 46 yards\n\n**Top receivers**\n* BUF \u2013 Stefon Diggs \u2013 8 receptions, 153 yards, TD\n* MIA \u2013 Mike Gesicki \u2013 8 receptions, 130 yards, TD\n\n\n |\n |\n\nBefore play began, both teams stayed in their respective locker rooms for the playing of the national anthem. Miami, hoping to recover from their Week 1 loss, kept it close, but no cigar. Josh Allen, improving his offensive gamesmanship for a third NFL season, threw for a career-best 417 yards and four TDs extending the Bills\u2019 winning streak to four-straight against the Fins. With 5:55 remaining in the 4th quarter and trailing 20-17, Allen threw a strike to the endzone for the score, after which, Buffalo never looked back. Buffalo's offense rolled over Miami for 524 total yards; 342 in the first half. At one point the Dolphins were poised to score from the Buffalo one-yard-line in the third quarter, but failed to connect on a 4th-down toss to the endzone. After the game, Dolphins\u2019 head coach Brian Flores said. \u201cYou've got to finish in this league if you want to win.\" Nevertheless, Miami stayed in the game to the finish. Ryan Fitzapatrick completed 31 of 47 pass attempts, but it wasn't enough to overcome a Buffalo offense that had a banner day in South Florida. The Bills-Dolphins rivalry has undeniably been reignited. With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 0\u20132.[16]\n\n\n\n#### Week 3: at Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]\n\n\n**Week Three: Miami Dolphins at Jacksonville Jaguars\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Dolphins** | 14 | 7 | 7 | 3 | **31** |\n| Jaguars | 0 | 7 | 0 | 6 | **13** |\n\n\n*at TIAA Bank Field, Jacksonville, Florida*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 24\n* **Game time**: 8:20\u00a0p.m. EDT\n* **Game weather**: Partly cloudy, 81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 16,563\n* **Referee**: Brad Allen\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(NFLN)**: Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, Erin Andrews, and Kristina Pink\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Preston Williams 3-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Jason Sanders kick), 8:09. *Dolphins 7\u20130. **Drive: 12 plays, 84 yards, 6:51.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jordan Howard 1-yard run (Jason Sanders kick), 2:37. *Dolphins 14\u20130. **Drive: 6 plays, 80 yards, 3:17.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* JAX \u2013 James Robinson 11-yard run (Brandon Wright kick), 13:04. *Dolphins 14\u20137. **Drive: 9 plays, 75 yards, 4:33.***\n* MIA \u2013 Mike Gesicki 15-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Jason Sanders kick), 5:58. *Dolphins 21\u20137. **Drive: 11 plays, 75 yards, 7:06.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick 1-yard run (Jason Sanders kick), 2:01. *Dolphins 28\u20137. **Drive: 4 plays, 5 yards, 2:03.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* JAX \u2013 James Robinson 1-yard run (kick failed), 9:03. *Dolphins 28\u201313. **Drive: 10 plays, 51 yards, 3:11.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 30-yard field goal, 3:49. *Dolphins 31\u201313. **Drive: 4 plays, 7 yards, 0:58.***\n | **Top passers**\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 18/20, 160 yards, 2 TD\n* JAX \u2013 Gardner Minshew \u2013 30/42, 275 yards, INT\n\n**Top rushers**\n* MIA \u2013 Myles Gaskin \u2013 22 rushes, 66 yards\n* JAX \u2013 James Robinson \u2013 11 rushes, 46 yards, 2 TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* MIA \u2013 DeVante Parker \u2013 5 receptions, 69 yards\n* JAX \u2013 James Robinson \u2013 6 receptions, 83 yards\n\n\n |\n |\n\nIn this nationally-televised Thursday night match-up, a dominant Ryan Fitzpatrick-led offense scored touchdowns on its first three possessions, pummeling a Jacksonville Jaguars squad that had been a three point favorite at home. On the opposite side of the ball, Gardner Minshew threw two picks and zero TDs, settling the pre-game argument over whose facial hair made them a better QB. \nMinshew, who came into the game confident after two strong performances to start the 2020 season, looked uncomfortable all night as Miami's defense garnered two sacks and limited the Jaguars to only 13 total points. This was the Dolphins' first win over the Jaguars since 2014 and their first win by 10+ points since a 2017 win over the Denver Broncos. With the win, the Dolphins improved to 1\u20132.[17][18]\n\n\n\n#### Week 4: vs. Seattle Seahawks[edit]\n\n\n**Week Four: Seattle Seahawks at Miami Dolphins\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Seahawks** | 10 | 7 | 0 | 14 | **31** |\n| Dolphins | 3 | 6 | 3 | 11 | **23** |\n\n\n*at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: October 4\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EDT\n* **Game weather**: Cloudy, 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 12,369\n* **Referee**: Scott Novak\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(Fox)**: Dick Stockton, Brady Quinn and Sara Walsh\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* SEA \u2013 Chris Carson 1-yard run (Jason Myers kick), 10:00. *Seahawks 7\u20130. **Drive: 6 play, 57 yards, 2:52.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 41-yard field goal, 2:33. *Seahawks 7\u20133. **Drive: 9 play, 54 yards, 4:02.***\n* SEA \u2013 Jason Myers 55-yard field goal, 0:07. *Seahawks 10\u20133. **Drive: 7 play, 39 yards, 2:26.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 29-yard field goal, 11:24. *Seahawks 10\u20136. **Drive: 8 play, 64 yards, 3:43.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 45-yard field goal, 0:24. *Seahawks 10\u20139. **Drive: 10 play, 48 yards, 4:21.***\n* SEA \u2013 Travis Homer 3-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Jason Myers kick), 0:03. *Seahawks 17\u20139. **Drive: 4 play, 75 yards, 0:21.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 43-yard field goal, 4:07. *Seahawks 17\u201312. **Drive: 10 play, 55 yards, 5:49.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 29-yard field goal, 8:31. *Seahawks 17\u201315. **Drive: 17 play, 73 yards, 7:59.***\n* SEA \u2013 David Moore 17-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Jason Myers kick), 5:24. *Seahawks 24\u201315. **Drive: 6 play, 75 yards, 3:07.***\n* SEA \u2013 Chris Carson 1-yard run (Jason Myers kick), 4:00. *Seahawks 31\u201315. **Drive: 2 play, 33 yards, 0:16.***\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick 10-yard run (Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2013Preston Williams pass), 1:50. *Seahawks 31\u201323. **Drive: 8 play, 75 yards, 2:10.***\n | **Top passers**\n* SEA \u2013 Russell Wilson \u2013 24/34, 360 yards, 2 TD, INT\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 29/45, 315 yards, 2 INT\n\n**Top rushers**\n* SEA \u2013 Chris Carson \u2013 16 rushes, 80 yards, 2 TD\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 6 rushes, 47 yards, TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* SEA \u2013 DK Metcalf \u2013 4 receptions, 106 yards\n* MIA \u2013 DeVante Parker \u2013 10 receptions, 110 yards\n\n\n |\n |\n\nOn a hot day in south Florida, the Seahawks came in to Hard Rock Stadium unbeaten and left with an unblemished record of 4-0. The Fins were unable to stop Russell Wilson's air offensive allowing him 360 yards passing and two completions to the endzone. Miami's defense had no answers as the \u2018Hawks continued their streak of scoring 30 points or more in every game this season. The Dolphins were able to score on their first five possessions, but all five trips into Seattle territory ended disappointingly with a field goal. Ryan Fitzpatrick might have had a solid performance (29 of 45 passing), but two interceptions ultimately resulted in a dispiriting home-field loss for his squad. This was the Seahawks' first road win over the Dolphins since 1996, when the Seahawks were part of the AFC West.

Ryan Fitzpatrick was magic as he threw 22 of 28 for 350 yards including three touchdowns and no interceptions. Jimmy Garoppolo was hideous and was benched halfway through the game after putting up 7 of 17 passing for a measly 77 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions. The Fins\u2019 defense carved up the Niners\u2019 offense all day, recovering a fumble, stealing two interceptions, forcing five sacks and allowing a third-down efficiency of only 20%.[20][21][22] In this rematch of Super Bowl XIX, this was the Dolphins' first road win over the 49ers since 2004, also their first time since October 25, 2015 scoring over 40 points in a game, and their largest blowout win since December 3, 2017.

With the win, the Dolphins improved to 4\u20133.\n\n\n\n#### Week 9: at Arizona Cardinals[edit]\n\n\n**Week Nine: Miami Dolphins at Arizona Cardinals\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Dolphins** | 14 | 10 | 0 | 10 | **34** |\n| Cardinals | 7 | 10 | 14 | 0 | **31** |\n\n\n*at State Farm Stadium, Glendale, Arizona*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: November 8\n* **Game time**: 4:25\u00a0p.m. EST/2:25\u00a0p.m. MST\n* **Game weather**: 66\u00a0\u00b0F (19\u00a0\u00b0C) (retractable roof open)\n* **Game attendance**: 4,200\n* **Referee**: Carl Cheffers\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Andrew Catalon, James Lofton and Michael Grady\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Shaq Lawson 36-yard fumble return (Jason Sanders kick), 10:37. *Dolphins 7\u20130.*\n* ARI \u2013 Maxx Williams 4-yard pass from Kyler Murray (Zane Gonzalez kick), 4:48. *Tied 7\u20137. **Drive: 10 plays, 75 yards, 3:46.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jordan Howard 2-yard run (Jason Sanders kick), 0:55. *Dolphins 14\u20137. **Drive: 10 plays, 75 yards, 5:56.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* ARI \u2013 Christian Kirk 56-yard pass from Kyler Murray (Zane Gonzalez kick), 14:23. *Tied 14\u201314. **Drive: 4 plays, 75 yards, 1:32.***\n* MIA \u2013 Preston Williams 9-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Jason Sanders kick), 10:18. *Dolphins 21\u201314. **Drive: 8 plays, 80 yards, 4:05.***\n* ARI \u2013 Zane Gonzalez 37-yard field goal, 5:10. *Dolphins 21\u201317. **Drive: 11 plays, 56 yards, 5:08.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 56-yard field goal, 0:03. *Dolphins 24\u201317. **Drive: 6 plays, 26 yards, 0:43.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* ARI \u2013 Darrell Daniels 21-yard pass from Kyler Murray (Zane Gonzalez kick), 12:13. *Tied 24\u201324. **Drive: 7 plays, 87 yards, 3:12.***\n* ARI \u2013 Kyler Murray 12-yard run (Zane Gonzalez kick), 2:34. *Cardinals 31\u201324. **Drive: 11 plays, 84 yards, 6:10.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Mack Hollins 11-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Jason Sanders kick), 11:19. *Tied 31\u201331. **Drive: 10 plays, 93 yards, 6:09.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 50-yard field goal, 3:35. *Dolphins 34\u201331. **Drive: 5 plays, 28 yards, 1:40.***\n | **Top passers**\n* MIA \u2013 Tua Tagovailoa \u2013 20/28, 248 yards, 2 TD\n* ARI \u2013 Kyler Murray \u2013 21/26, 283 yards, 3 TD\n\n**Top rushers**\n* MIA \u2013 Salvon Ahmed \u2013 7 rushes, 38 yards\n* ARI \u2013 Kyler Murray \u2013 11 rushes, 106 yards, TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* MIA \u2013 DeVante Parker \u2013 6 receptions, 64 yards\n* ARI \u2013 Christian Kirk \u2013 5 receptions, 123 yards, TD\n\n\n |\n |\n\nIn a back-and-forth game, Miami pulled ahead late in the game with 10 points in the fourth quarter, taking the lead with a 50-yard field goal from Jason Sanders after the two-minute warning.

Despite throwing two touchdowns, Herbert also tossed an interception forced by a Miami defense that hounded him all day. Tagovailoa threw for two scores and zero interceptions which culminated in his third-straight victory as a rookie QB. By defeating the Chargers, the Fins have won five straight games.[23][24] The Dolphins began the season 6\u20133 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa also became the 5th rookie quarterback since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to begin 3\u20130, after Ben Roethlisberger, Mark Sanchez, Carson Wentz, and Lamar Jackson.\n\n\n\n#### Week 11: at Denver Broncos[edit]\n\n\n**Week Eleven: Miami Dolphins at Denver Broncos\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dolphins | 7 | 3 | 0 | 3 | **13** |\n| **Broncos** | 7 | 6 | 7 | 0 | **20** |\n\n\n*at Empower Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: November 22\n* **Game time**: 4:05\u00a0p.m. EST/2:05\u00a0p.m. MST\n* **Game weather**: Mostly sunny, 45\u00a0\u00b0F (7\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 5,351\n* **Referee**: Land Clark\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Kevin Harlan, Trent Green and Melanie Collins\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 DeVante Parker 3-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Jason Sanders kick), 10:08. *Dolphins 7\u20130. **Drive: 5 plays, 22 yards, 2:50.***\n* DEN \u2013 Melvin Gordon 1-yard run (Brandon McManus kick), 1:34. *Tied 7\u20137. **Drive: 11 plays, 73 yards, 6:00.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* DEN \u2013 Brandon McManus 29-yard field goal, 9:55. *Broncos 10\u20137. **Drive: 5 plays, 48 yards, 1:54.***\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 41-yard field goal, 2:39. *Tied 10\u201310. **Drive: 14 plays, 52 yards, 7:16.***\n* DEN \u2013 Brandon McManus 47-yard field goal, 0:00. *Broncos 13\u201310. **Drive: 9 plays, 60 yards, 2:34.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* DEN \u2013 Melvin Gordon 20-yard run (Brandon McManus kick), 2:31. *Broncos 20\u201310. **Drive: 9 plays, 84 yard, 4:46.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* MIA \u2013 Jason Sanders 53-yard field goal, 7:51. *Broncos 20\u201313. **Drive: 7 plays, 44 yards, 2:04.***\n | **Top passers**\n* MIA \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 12/18, 117 yards, INT\n* DEN \u2013 Drew Lock \u2013 18/30, 270 yards, INT\n\n**Top rushers**\n* MIA \u2013 Salvon Ahmed \u2013 12 rushes, 43 yards\n* DEN \u2013 Melvin Gordon \u2013 15 rushes, 84 yards, 2 TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* MIA \u2013 DeVante Parker \u2013 6 receptions, 61 yards, TD\n* DEN \u2013 Tim Patrick \u2013 5 receptions, 119 yards\n\n\n |\n |\n\nThe Dolphins played without running back Jordan Howard as he got cut on November 16, 2020, after just nine games with the Dolphins.

Backup quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick also finished with a winning record in his career for the first time since 2015, when he played for the New York Jets, and for only the second time in his 15-year career.

Backup quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick relieved a struggling Tua Tagovailoa in the 4th quarter and threw to Myles Gaskin for a touchdown to hand the Dolphins their first lead of the game, 23\u201322. After the Raiders retook the lead with only 23 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Fitzpatrick threw a no-look pass to Mack Hollins while his facemask was being tugged by a defender, a pass which Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes dubbed \"the greatest no-look pass of all time\",[26] to set up Sanders' game-winning field goal. This would also be Fitzpatrick's last appearance as a Dolphin, as he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days later, which caused him to miss the season finale versus the Buffalo Bills, and would sign with the Washington Football Team as a free agent on March 15, 2021, the 9th team he has played for in 16 years.

Some additions and changes include the team hiring Martin Mayhew as general manager and Marty Hurney as another high-ranking executive.[1] With the hiring of Mayhew, who is black, Washington became the first team in NFL history to concurrently have a minority general manager, head coach, and team president.[2] Ryan Kerrigan, the franchise's all-time sack leader, became a free agent in the offseason and played the year with division rival Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\nWashington failed to improve upon their 7\u20139 record from the previous season, failed to repeat as division champions, and missed the playoffs for the fifth time in their past six seasons after a Week 17 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Washington was also the first team since the 1995 Tampa Bay Buccaneers to have their final five games of the season be within the division.[3] This season was also the last under the transitional \"Football Team\" moniker as they rebranded as the Commanders in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Draft[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 NFL Draft\n\n\n\n2021 Washington Football Team Draft\n| Round | Selection | Player | Position | College | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 19\n | Jamin Davis | LB | Kentucky |  |\n| 2 | 51\n | Sam Cosmi | T | Texas |  |\n| 3 | 74\n | Benjamin St-Juste | CB | Minnesota | from San Francisco\n |\n| 82\n | Dyami Brown | WR | North Carolina |  |\n| 4 | 124\n | John Bates | TE | Boise State |  |\n| 5 | 163\n | Darrick Forrest | SS | Cincinnati |  |\n| 6 | 225\n | Camaron Cheeseman | LS | Michigan | from Philadelphia\n |\n| 7 | 240\n | William Bradley-King | DE | Baylor |\n| 246\n | Shaka Toney | DE | Penn State |  |\n| 258\n | Dax Milne | WR | BYU | from Miami\n |\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n* Washington received a third-round selection from San Francisco in exchange for offensive tackle Trent Williams.[4]\n* Washington received a seventh-round selection and offensive tackle David Sharpe from Las Vegas in exchange for a 2020 sixth-round selection.[5]\n* Washington traded a seventh-round selection (244th overall) to Miami in exchange for a seventh-round selection (258th overall) and offensive guard Ereck Flowers.[6]\n* Washington received sixth- and seventh-round selections (225th and 240th overall) from Philadelphia in exchange for a 2022 fifth-round selection.[7]\n\n\n## Staff[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2021 Washington Football Team staff**\n|  | **Front office**\n* Owner \u2013 Daniel Snyder\n* CEO \u2013 Tanya Snyder\n* President \u2013 Jason Wright\n* General manager \u2013 Martin Mayhew\n* Executive vice president of football/player personnel \u2013 Marty Hurney\n* Senior vice president of football administration \u2013 Rob Rogers\n* Senior director of player personnel \u2013 Eric Stokes\n* Director of pro personnel \u2013 Chris Polian\n* Director of college personnel \u2013 Tim Gribble\n* Senior advisor \u2013 Doug Williams\n* Senior pro scout \u2013 Don Warren\n* College scouts -

The Chargers scored a TD with a 3 yard Austin Ekeler run on the first drive of the game. The rest of the scoring in the first half was an exchange of field goals which gave the Chargers a 13-9 lead. To mirror the start of the first half Washington scored a TD on the first drive of the half, with an 11 yard pass from Taylor Heinicke to Logan Thomas. Washington got the ball back in their own redzone thanks to a dubious call ruling Herbert had fumbled into the end zone under pressure from Montez Sweat. Hopkins then missed a field goal before the decisive moment came at the start of the 4th quarter. William Jackson intercepted Herbert in the Washington redzone but on the subsequent play Antonio Gibson fumbled the ball on the Washington 5 yard which was recovered by the Charger who then scored the game winning TD with a 3 yard pass to Mike Williams. This would be QB Ryan Fitzpatrick's last game, as he suffered a season ending injury in the second quarter and would promptly retire after the season.\n\n\n\n#### Week 2: vs. New York Giants[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Washington vs. the New York Giants\n**Week 2: New York Giants at Washington Football Team\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Giants | 7 | 3 | 10 | 9 | **29** |\n| **Washington** | 0 | 14 | 3 | 13 | **30** |\n\n\n*at FedExField, Landover, Maryland*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 16\n* **Game time**: 8:20\u00a0p.m. EDT\n* **Game weather**: Overcast, 72\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 50,118\n* **Referee**: Scott Novak\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(NFLN)**: Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, Erin Andrews and Kristina Pink\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* NYG \u2013 Daniel Jones 6-yard run (Graham Gano kick), 7:35. *Giants 7\u20130. **Drive: 11 plays, 79 yards, 5:55.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* WAS \u2013 Terry McLaurin 11-yard pass from Taylor Heinicke (Dustin Hopkins kick), 11:16. *Tied 7\u20137. **Drive: 13 plays, 90 yards, 7:01.***\n* NYG \u2013 Graham Gano 23-yard field goal, 4:09. *Giants 10\u20137. **Drive: 10 plays, 73 yards, 4:09.***\n* WAS \u2013 J.

After Washington took a 14-10 lead into halftime, the Giants scored on their first 4 possessions of the second half to take a 26-20 lead. Washington answered back with a touchdown from Heinicke to Ricky Seals-Jones to take a 27-26 lead, but the Giants capitalized on a late Heinicke interception to take a 29-27 lead. After Washington got into field goal range, Dustin Hopkins missed a 48-yard field goal to win the game. However, the Giants were offside, which nullified the miss and gave Washington one untimed down, since a game cannot end on a defensive penalty. Hopkins made his second attempt from 43 yards to give Washington the win. This was Washington's first win over the Giants since Week 8 of the 2018 season, and improved their record to 1-1 on the season.\n\n\n\n#### Week 3: at Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Washington vs. the Buffalo Bills\n**Week 3: Washington Football Team at Buffalo Bills\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Washington | 0 | 14 | 0 | 7 | **21** |\n| **Bills** | 7 | 20 | 9 | 7 | **43** |\n\n\n*at Highmark Stadium, Orchard Park, New York*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: September 26\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EDT\n* **Game weather**: Sunny, 66\u00a0\u00b0F (19\u00a0\u00b0C)\n* **Game attendance**: 68,434\n* **Referee**: Tony Corrente\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(Fox)**: Chris Myers, Daryl Johnston and Jen Hale\n* Recap, Game Book\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Emmanuel Sanders 28-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 10:53. *Bills 7\u20130. **Drive: 8 plays, 75 yards, 4:07.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Zack Moss 7-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 12:59. *Bills 14\u20130. **Drive: 8 plays, 52 yards, 4:12.***\n* BUF \u2013 Dawson Knox 14-yard pass from Josh Allen (Tyler Bass kick), 10:42. *Bills 21\u20130. **Drive: 3 plays, 17 yards, 0:55.***\n* WAS \u2013 Antonio Gibson 73-yard pass from Taylor Heinicke (Dustin Hopkins kick), 9:51. *Bills 21\u20137. **Drive: 2 plays, 75 yards, 0:51.***\n* WAS \u2013 Taylor Heinicke 4-yard run (Dustin Hopkins kick), 7:39. *Bills 21\u201314. **Drive: 5 plays, 24 yards, 2:12.***\n* BUF \u2013 Tyler Bass 21-yard field goal, 1:37. *Bills 24\u201314. **Drive: 7 plays, 55 yards, 1:52.***\n* BUF \u2013 Tyler Bass 48-yard field goal, 0:00. *Bills 27\u201314. **Drive: 5 plays, 51 yards, 0:26.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Emmanuel Sanders 5-yard field pass from Josh Allen (pass failed), 4:43. *Bills 33\u201314. **Drive: 17 plays, 93 yards, 8:17.***\n* BUF \u2013 Tyler Bass 29-yard field goal, 2:11. *Bills 36\u201314. **Drive: 4 plays, 6 yards, 0:53.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Josh Allen 2-yard run (Tyler Bass kick), 10:29. *Bills 43\u201314. **Drive: 3 plays, 22 yards, 1:08.***\n* WAS \u2013 Logan Thomas 2-yard pass from Taylor Heinicke (Dustin Hopkins kick), 5:21. *Bills 43\u201321. **Drive: 10 plays, 75 yards, 5:08.***\n | **Top passers**\n* WAS \u2013 Taylor Heinicke \u2013 14/24, 212 yards, 2 TD, 2 INT\n* BUF \u2013 Josh Allen \u2013 32/43, 358 yards, 4 TD\n\n**Top rushers**\n* WAS \u2013 Antonio Gibson \u2013 12 rushes, 31 yards\n* BUF \u2013 Zack Moss \u2013 13 rushes, 60 yards\n\n**Top receivers**\n* WAS \u2013 Antonio Gibson \u2013 1 reception, 73 yards, TD\n* BUF \u2013 Cole Beasley \u2013 11 receptions, 98 yards\n\n\n |\n |\n\nBuffalo got out to a 21-0 lead early, and Washington was never able to fully recover in a 43-21 loss.
