ASU has nearly 145,000[5] students attending classes, with more than 62,000[5] students attending online, and 112,000[5] undergraduates and nearly 30,000[5] postgraduates across its five campuses and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona.[5][13] ASU offers 350 degree options from its 17 colleges and more than 170 cross-discipline centers and institutes for undergraduates students, as well as more than 400 graduate degree and certificate programs.[14]\n\n\nThe Arizona State Sun Devils compete in 26 varsity-level sports in the NCAA Division I Pac-12 Conference and is home to over 1,100 registered student organizations.[15] Sun Devil teams have won 165 national championships, including 24 NCAA trophies. 179 Sun Devils have made Olympic teams, winning 60 Olympic medals: 25 gold, 12 silver, and 23 bronze.\n\n\nAs of January 2022,[update] ASU reported that its faculty of more than 5,000 scholars[5] included 5 Nobel laureates, 10 MacArthur Fellows, 10 Pulitzer Prize winners, 10 National Academy of Engineering members, 23 National Academy of Sciences members, 26 American Academy of Arts and Sciences members, 41 Guggenheim fellows, 157 National Endowment for the Humanities fellows, and 281 Fulbright Program American Scholars.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Arizona State University\n\n![](image)President Theodore Roosevelt addresses a crowd of students on the steps of the Old Main at Tempe Normal School (future Arizona State University), March 20, 1911.\n### 1885–1929[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Main on the Arizona Territorial Normal School (future Arizona State University) campus, circa 1890\nArizona State University was established as the **Territorial Normal School** at Tempe on March 12, 1885, when the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature passed an act to create a normal school to train teachers for the Arizona Territory. The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes began with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as **Tempe Normal School of Arizona** (1889–1903), **Tempe Normal School** (1903–1925), **Tempe State Teachers College** (1925–1929), **Arizona State Teachers College** (1929–1945), **Arizona State College** (1945–1958) and, by a 2–1 margin of the state's voters, **Arizona State University** in 1958.\n\n\nIn 1923, the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925, the school became the **Tempe State Teachers College** and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the 9th Arizona State Legislature authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the **Arizona State Teachers College**.[17][18] Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews (1900–1930), the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision in 1902. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. Matthews envisioned an \"evergreen campus\", with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of 110 Mexican Fan Palms on what is now known as Palm Walk, a century-old landmark of the Tempe campus.\n\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Ralph Waldo Swetman was hired to succeed President Matthews, coming to Arizona State Teachers College in 1930 from Humboldt State Teachers College where he had served as president. He served a three-year term, during which he focused on improving teacher-training programs.[19] During his tenure, enrollment at the college doubled, topping the 1,000 mark for the first time.[20] Matthews also conceived of a self-supported summer session at the school at Arizona State Teachers College, a first for the school.\n\n\n\n### 1930–1989[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ASU's Gammage Auditorium, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright\nIn 1933, Grady Gammage, then president of Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff, became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, beginning a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years, second only to Swetman's 30 years at the college's helm. Like President Arthur John Matthews before him, Gammage oversaw the construction of several buildings on the Tempe campus. He also guided the development of the university's graduate programs; the first Master of Arts in Education was awarded in 1938, the first Doctor of Education degree in 1954 and 10 non-teaching master's degrees were approved by the Arizona Board of Regents in 1956. During his presidency, the school's name was changed to **Arizona State College** in 1945, and finally to **Arizona State University** in 1958. At the time, two other names were considered: **Tempe University** and **State University at Tempe**.[21] Among Gammage's greatest achievements in Tempe was the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed construction of what is Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium/ASU Gammage. One of the university's hallmark buildings, ASU Gammage was completed in 1964, five years after the president's (and Wright's) death.\n\n\nGammage was succeeded by Harold D. Richardson, who had served the school earlier in a variety of roles beginning in 1939, including director of graduate studies, college registrar, dean of instruction, dean of the College of Education and academic vice president. Although filling the role of acting president of the university for just nine months (Dec. 1959 to Sept. 1960), Richardson laid the groundwork for the future recruitment and appointment of well-credentialed research science faculty.\n\n\nBy the 1960s, under G. Homer Durham, the university's 11th president, ASU began to expand its curriculum by establishing several new colleges and, in 1961, the Arizona Board of Regents authorized doctoral degree programs in six fields, including Doctor of Philosophy.[22] By the end of his nine-year tenure, ASU had more than doubled enrollment, reporting 23,000 in 1969.\n\n\nThe next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn (1969–71), John W. Schwada (1971–81) and J. Russell Nelson (1981–89), including and Interim President Richard Peck (1989)—led the university to increased academic stature, the establishment of the ASU West campus in 1984 and its subsequent construction in 1986, a focus on computer-assisted learning and research, and rising enrollment.\n\n\n\n### 1990–present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Example of a new academic village, taken at Barrett, The Honors College on the Tempe Campus\nUnder the leadership of Lattie F. Coor, president from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the Polytechnic campus and extended education sites. Increased commitment to diversity, quality in undergraduate education, research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500 million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of Barrett, The Honors College, and the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)ASU's Biodesign Institute on Tempe campus\nIn 2002, Michael M. Crow became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, he outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a \"New American University\"[24]—one that would be open and inclusive, and set a goal for the university to meet Association of American Universities criteria and to become a member.[10] Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into \"One university in many places\"—a single institution comprising several campuses, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Subsequent reorganizations[25] combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced staff and administration as the university expanded its West and Polytechnic campuses. ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus was also expanded, with several colleges and schools relocating there. The university established learning centers throughout the state, including the ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City and programs in Thatcher, Yuma, and Tucson. Students at these centers can choose from several ASU degree and certificate programs.\n\n\nDuring Crow's tenure, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU began a years-long research facility capital building effort that led to the establishment of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability, and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of five Nobel Laureates.[26][27] Since 2002, the university's research expenditures have tripled and more than 1.5 million square feet of space has been added to the university's research facilities.[28]\n\n\n\nThe economic downturn that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget. In response to these cuts, ASU capped enrollment, closed some four dozen academic programs, combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced university faculty, staff and administrators;[29] with an economic recovery underway in 2011, however, the university continued its campaign to expand the West and Polytechnic Campuses,[30] and establish a low-cost, teaching-focused extension campus in Lake Havasu City.[31] As of 2011, an article in *Slate* reported that, \"the bottom line looks good\", noting that:[32] \n\n\n> Since Crow's arrival, ASU's research funding has almost tripled to nearly $350 million. Degree production has increased by 45 percent. And thanks to an ambitious aid program, enrollment of students from Arizona families below poverty is up 647 percent.\n> \n> \n\n\nOn May 1, 2014, ASU was listed as one of fifty-five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights \"for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints\" by Barack Obama's White House Task Force To Protect Students from Sexual Assault.[33][34] The publicly announced investigation followed two Title IX suits.[35] In July 2014, a group of at least nine current and former students who alleged they were harassed or assaulted asked the federal investigation be expanded.[36]\nIn August 2014 ASU president Michael Crow appointed a task force[37] comprising faculty and staff, students, and members of the university police force to review the university's efforts to address sexual violence. Crow accepted the recommendations of the task force in November 2014.[38]\n\n\nIn 2015, the Thunderbird School of Global Management became the fifth ASU campus, as the Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU. Partnerships for education and research with Mayo Clinic established collaborative degree programs in health care and law, and shared administrator positions, laboratories and classes at the Mayo Clinic Arizona campus.\n\n\nThe Beus Center for Law and Society, the new home of ASU's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, opened in fall 2016 on the Downtown Phoenix campus, relocating faculty and students from the Tempe campus to the state capital.[39]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| **ASU college/school founding** |\n| --- |\n| **College/School** | **Year founded**\n |\n| Barrett, The Honors College | 1988\n |\n| College of Health Solutions | 2012\n |\n| Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts | 1964\n |\n| Ira A.

Members of the board include the state governor and superintendent of public instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regents members with eight-year terms who are appointed by the governor, and two student regents, each with two-year terms, and each serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices.[41] ABOR provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has four campuses in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, including the Tempe campus in Tempe; the West campus in Glendale; the Downtown Phoenix campus; and the Polytechnic campus in Mesa. ASU also offers courses and degrees through ASU Online and at the ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City in western Arizona, and offers regional learning programs in Thatcher, Yuma and Tucson.\n\n\nThe Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered the institution's chief executive officer and the chief budget officer.[42] The president executes measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the university's property, and acts as the university's official representative to the Board of Regents.[43] The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers.[44] The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels. The 16th ASU president is Michael M. Crow, who has served since July 1, 2002.[45]\n\n\n\n## Campuses and locations[edit]\n\n\nAcademic programs are spread across four distinct campuses in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area; unlike most multi-campus institutions, however, ASU describes itself as \"one university in many places\", inferring there is \"not a system with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses.\"[11] The university considers each campus \"distinctive\" and academically focused on certain aspects of the overall university mission. The Tempe campus is the university's research and graduate school center. Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs that prepare students for graduate school, professional school, or employment.[46] The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation. The Polytechnic campus is the site of many of the university's simulators and laboratories dedicated for project-based learning.[47] The West campus is focused on interdisciplinary degrees and the liberal arts, while maintaining professional programs with a direct impact on the community and society.[48] The Downtown Phoenix campus focuses on direct urban and public programs such as nursing, public policy, criminal justice, mass communication, and journalism.[49] ASU recently relocated some nursing and health related programs to its new ASU-Mayo Medical School campus. Inter-campus shuttles and light rail allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU's \"virtual campus\" at the university's SkySong Innovation Center, provides online and extended education.\n\n\nThe Arizona Board of Regents reports the ASU facilities inventory totals more than 23 million gross square feet.[50]\n\n\n\n### Tempe campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arizona State University Tempe campus\n\nASU's Tempe campus is in downtown Tempe, Arizona, about eight miles (13 km) east of downtown Phoenix. The campus is considered urban, and is approximately 660 acres (2.7 km2) in size. It is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum.[51] The Tempe campus is also the largest of ASU's campuses, with more than 70,000[a] students enrolled in at least one class on campus in fall 2017.[5] The campus is considered to range from the streets Rural Road on the east to Mill Avenue on the west, and Apache Boulevard on the south to Rio Salado Parkway on the north.\n\n\nThe Tempe campus is ASU's original campus, and Old Main, the oldest building on campus,[52] still stands. Today's university and the Tempe campus were founded as the Territorial Normal School when first constructed, and was originally a teachers college. There are many notable landmarks on campus, including Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright; Palm Walk, which is lined by 111 palm trees;[53] Charles Trumbull Hayden Library; the University Club building; Margaret Gisolo Dance Theatre; Arizona State University Art Museum;[54] and University Bridge. Furthermore, the Tempe campus is home to Barrett, The Honors College. In addition, the campus has an extensive public art collection; It was named \"the single most impressive venue for contemporary art in Arizona\" by *Art in America* magazine.[55] Against the northwest edge of campus is the Mill Avenue district (part of downtown Tempe), which has a college atmosphere that attracts many students to its restaurants and bars. Students also have Tempe Marketplace, a shopping, dining and entertainment center with an outdoor setting near the northeast border of the campus. The Tempe campus is also home to all of the university's athletic facilities.\n\n\n\n* ![Old Main, the oldest building on campus](image)\n\nOld Main, the oldest building on campus\n* ![The ASU Bridge](image)\n\nThe ASU Bridge\n* ![The Gammage Auditorium was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright](image)\n\nThe Gammage Auditorium was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright\n* ![The Palm Walk is the main pathway through the campus.](image)\n\nThe Palm Walk is the main pathway through the campus.\n\n\n### West Valley campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arizona State University West campus\n\n![](image)Fletcher Library, West Valley Campus\nEstablished in 1984 by the Arizona legislature,[56] the West Valley campus sits on 277.92 acres (1.1247 km2) in a suburban area of northwest Phoenix. The West Valley campus lies about 12 miles (19 km) northwest of Downtown Phoenix, and about 18 miles (29 km) northwest of the Tempe campus. The West Valley campus is designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride[57] and is nearly completely powered by a solar array.[58] The campus serves more than 4,000 students enrolled in at least a single course[5] and offers more than 100 degree programs from the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, W. P. Carey School of Business, College of Public Service and Community Solutions, College of Health Solutions, and the College of Nursing and Health Innovation.[59]\n\n\n\n### Polytechnic campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arizona State University Polytechnic campus\n\n![](image)Picacho Hall (left) and Peralta Hall (right) at the Polytechnic campus\nFounded in 1996 as \"ASU East\", the ASU Polytechnic campus serves more than 4,800[5] students and is home to more than 130 bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in professional, technical science, humanities, social science and pre-health programs through the W. P. Carey School of Business/Morrison School of Management and Agribusiness, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, and College of Integrative Sciences and Arts.[60][61] The campus — a desert arboretum — includes outdoor learning labs and spaces as well as leading-edge simulators and indoor lab spaces to support teaching and research in various fields of study.[47] The 600-acre (2.4 km2) campus is in southeast Mesa, Arizona, approximately 25 miles (40 km) southeast of the Tempe campus, and 33 miles (53 km) southeast of downtown Phoenix. The Polytechnic campus sits on the former Williams Air Force Base[47] and is adjacent to the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport and Chandler-Gilbert Community College (Williams campus).\n\n\n\n### Downtown Phoenix campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus\n\n![](image)Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Downtown Phoenix Campus\nThe Downtown Phoenix campus was established in 2006 on the north side of Downtown Phoenix.[62] The campus has an urban design, with several large modern academic buildings intermingled with commercial and retail office buildings. In addition to the new buildings, the campus included the adaptive reuse of several existing structures, including a 1930s era Post Office that is on the National Register of Historic Places.[63] Serving 11,465[5] students, the campus houses the College of Health Solutions,[64] College of Integrative Science and Arts, College of Nursing and Health Innovation,[65] College of Public Service and Community Solutions,[66] Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, and Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. In 2013, the campus added the Sun Devil Fitness Center in conjunction with the original YMCA building.[67] ASU's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law relocated from Tempe to the Downtown Phoenix campus in 2016.[39]\n\n\n\n### ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City\n\nIn response to demands for lower-cost public higher education in Arizona, ASU developed the small, undergraduate-only college in Lake Havasu City. ASU Colleges are teaching-focused and provide a selection of popular undergraduate majors.[31] The Lake Havasu City campus offers undergraduate degrees at lower tuition rates than other Arizona research universities[68] and a 15-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio.[31]\n\n\n\n### ASU Online[edit]\n\n\nASU Online offers more than 150 undergraduate and graduate degree programs through an online platform.[69] The degree programs delivered online hold the same accreditation as the university's traditional face-to-face programs. ASU Online is headquartered at ASU's SkySong campus in Scottsdale, Arizona. ASU Online was ranked in the Top 4 for Best Online Bachelor's Programs by *U.S. News & World Report*.[70]\n\n\nOnline students are taught by the same faculty and receive the same diploma as on-campus students. ASU online programs allow students to learn in highly interactive environments through student collaboration and through technological personalized learning environments.[71]\n\n\nIn April 2015, ASU Online announced a partnership with edX to form a one of a kind program called the Global Freshman Academy. The program is open to all potential students. The students do not need to submit a high school transcript or GPA to apply for the courses.[72]\n\n\nAs of spring 2017, more than 25,000 students were enrolled through ASU Online.[73] In June 2014, ASU Online and Starbucks announced a partnership called the Starbucks College Achievement Plan. The Starbucks College Achievement Plan offers all benefits-eligible employees full-tuition coverage when they enroll in any one of ASU Online's undergraduate degree programs.[74]\n\n\n\n### Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, in collaboration with ASU[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Mayo Clinic and ASU formed a new platform for health care education and research: the Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University Alliance for Health Care.[75] Beginning in 2017, Mayo Clinic School of Medicine students in Phoenix and Scottsdale are among the first to earn a certificate in the Science of Health Care Delivery, with the option to earn a master's degree in the Science of Health Care Delivery through ASU.[76]\n\n\n\n### Thunderbird Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Thunderbird School of Global Management\n\nThunderbird School of Global Management is one of the newest units of \"Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise.\" The flagship campus was in Glendale, Arizona, at Thunderbird Field No. 1, a former military airfield from which it derives its name, until 2018 when the Thunderbird School relocated to the Downtown area.[77]\n\n\n\n### Barrett and O'Connor Center[edit]\n\n\nFollowing a nearly 15-year presence in Washington, D.C., through more minor means, ASU opened the Barrett and O'Connor Center in 2018 to solidify the university's contacts with the capital city. The center houses ASU's D.C.-based academic programs, including the Washington Bureau of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law Rule of Law and Governance program, the Capital Scholars program, and the McCain Institute's Next Generation Leaders program, among many others. In addition to hosting classes and internships on-site, special lectures and seminars taught from the Barrett & O'Connor Washington Center are connected to classrooms in Arizona through video-conferencing technology.[78] The Barrett and O'Connor center is located at 1800 I St NW, Washington, DC 20006, close to the White House.\n\n\n\n### ASU California Center in Downtown Los Angeles[edit]\n\n\nASU's California Center is located in Los Angeles at the Herald Examiner Building.[79] The center offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, executive education, workshops and seminars.[80]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Parts of this article (those related to 2017 data) need to be **updated**.

These programs are divided into 16 colleges and schools that are spread across ASU's six campuses. ASU also offers the 4+1 accelerated program, which allows students in their senior year to attain their master's degree the following year.[93] The 4+1 accelerated program is not associated with all majors; for example, in the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College the 4+1 accelerated program only works with Education Exploratory majors. ASU uses a plus-minus grading system with highest cumulative GPA awarded of 4.0 (at time of graduation). Arizona State University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.[94] ASU is one of only four universities in the country to offer a certificate in veterans studies.[95]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[96] | 39–51 |\n| *Forbes*[97] | 106 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[98] | 105 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[99] | 33 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[100] | 72 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[101] | 101–150 |\n| *QS*[102] | 179 |\n| *THE*[103] | 156 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[104] | 156 |\n\n | \n\n| National Program Rankings[105] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Audiology | 18\n |\n| Biological Sciences | 62\n |\n| Business | 35\n |\n| Chemistry | 52\n |\n| Clinical Psychology | 27\n |\n| Computer Science | 43\n |\n| Criminology | 5\n |\n| Earth Sciences | 15\n |\n| Economics | 9\n |\n| Education | 13\n |\n| Engineering | 41\n |\n| English | 60\n |\n| Fine Arts | 15\n |\n| History | 69\n |\n| Law | 24\n |\n| Mathematics | 62\n |\n| Nursing: Doctorate | 45\n |\n| Nursing: Master's | 40\n |\n| Physics | 44\n |\n| Political Science | 51\n |\n| Psychology | 39\n |\n| Public Affairs | 19\n |\n| Social Work | 25\n |\n| Sociology | 67\n |\n| Speech–Language Pathology | 16\n |\n| Statistics | 79\n |\n\n | \n\n| Global Program Rankings[106] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Arts & Humanities | 56\n |\n| Biology & Biochemistry | 157\n |\n| Chemistry | 178\n |\n| Civil Engineering | 68\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | 455\n |\n| Computer Science | 78\n |\n| Economics & Business | 25\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering | 115\n |\n| Engineering | 90\n |\n| Environment/Ecology | 73\n |\n| Geosciences | 86\n |\n| Materials Science | 163\n |\n| Mathematics | 190\n |\n| Molecular Biology & Genetics | 108\n |\n| Neuroscience & Behavior | 207\n |\n| Physics | 408\n |\n| Plant & Animal Science | 126\n |\n| Psychiatry/Psychology | 74\n |\n| Social Sciences & Public Health | 19\n |\n| Space Science | 119\n |\n\n\n |\n\nThe 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* ratings ranked ASU tied for 103rd among universities in the United States and tied for 146th globally.[107] It was also tied for 46th among public universities in the United States, and was ranked 1st among \"most innovative schools\", tied for 16th in \"best undergraduate teaching\", 131st in \"best value schools\", and tied for 191st in \"top performers on social mobility\" among national universities in the U.S.[107] The innovation ranking, new for 2016, was determined by a poll of top college officials nationwide asking them to name institutions \"that are making the most innovative improvements in terms of curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology or facilities.\"[108]\n\n\nASU is ranked 42nd–56th in the U.S. and 101st–150th in the world among the top 1000 universities in the 2020 Academic Ranking of World Universities,[109] and 67th U.S./183rd world by the 2020–21 Center for World University Rankings.[110] *Money* magazine ranked ASU 124th in the country out of 739 schools evaluated for its 2020 \"Best Colleges for Your Money\" edition.[111] *The Wall Street Journal* ranks ASU 5th in the nation for producing the best-qualified graduates, determined by a nationwide poll of corporate recruiters.[112]\n\n\nASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication has been named one of America's top 10 journalism schools by national publications and organizations for more than a decade. The rankings include: College Magazine (10th), Quality Education and Jobs (6th), and International Student (1st).[113][114][115]\n\n\nFor its efforts as a national leader in campus sustainability, ASU was named one of the top 6 \"Cool Schools\" by the Sierra Club in 2017,[116] was named one of the Princeton Review's most sustainable schools in 2015[117] and earned an \"A−\" grade on the 2011 College Sustainability Green Report Card.[118]\n\n\n\n### Research and Institutes[edit]\n\n\nASU is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity\".[119] The university spent $673 million in fiscal year 2020, ranking it 43rd nationally.[120][121][122] ASU is a NASA designated national space-grant institute and a member of the Universities Research Association. In 2023, it became a member of the Association of American Universities, an elite organization of 71 research universities in the U.S. and Canada.[123] The university is currently in the top 10 for NASA-funded research expenditures.[121]\n\n\nThe university has raised more than $999 million in external funding, and more than 180 companies based on ASU innovations have been launched through the university's exclusive intellectual property management company, Skysong Innovations.[124] The U.S. National Academy of Inventors and the Intellectual Property Owners Association rank ASU in the top 10 nationally and No. 11 globally for U.S. patents awarded to universities in 2020, along with MIT, Stanford and Harvard.[125][126] ASU jumped to 10th place from 17th in 2017, according to the U.S. National Academy of Inventors and the Intellectual Property Owners Association.[127][128] Since its inception, Skysong Innovations has fostered the launch of more than 180 companies based on ASU innovations, and attracted more than $999 million in venture funding, including $96 million in fiscal year 2016 alone.[124] In 2013, the Sweden-based University Business Incubator (UBI) Index, named ASU as one of the top universities in the world for business incubation, ranking 17th. UBI reviewed 550 universities and associated business incubators from around the world using an assessment framework that takes more than 50 performance indicators into consideration.[129] As an example, one of ASU's spin-offs (Heliae Development, LLC) raised more than $28 million in venture capital in 2013 alone.[130] In June 2016, ASU received the Entrepreneurial University Award from the Deshpande Foundation, a philanthropic organization that supports social entrepreneurship and innovation.[131]\n\n\nThe university's push to create various institutes has led to greater funding and an increase in the number of researchers in multiple fields. ASU Knowledge Enterprise (KE) advances research, innovation, strategic partnerships, entrepreneurship, economic development and international development.[132] KE is led by Sally C. Morton.[133][134] KE supports several interdisciplinary research institutes and initiatives.[135][136] Other notable and famed institutes at ASU are The Institute of Human Origins, L. William Seidman Research Institute (W. P. Carey School of Business), Learning Sciences Institute, Herberger Research Institute, and the Hispanic Research Center. The Biodesign Institute for instance, conducts research on issues such as biomedical and health care outcomes as part of a collaboration with Mayo Clinic to diagnose and treat diseases.[137] The institute has attracted more than $760 million in external funding, filed 860 invention disclosures, nearly 200 patents, and generated 35 spinout companies based on its research.[138] In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Biodesign developed a rapid, saliva-based testing option for the university community, and partnered with the Arizona Department of Health Services to make the saliva-based COVID test available to the public.[139][140][141][142] In October 2021, Biodesign announced their millionth test.[143][144] The institute also is heavily involved in sustainability research, primarily through reuse of CO2 via biological feedback and various biomasses (e.g. algae) to synthesize clean biofuels. Heliae is a Biodesign Institute spin-off and much of its business centers on algal-derived, high value products.[145] Furthermore, the institute is heavily involved in security research including technology that can detect biological and chemical changes in the air and water. The university has received more than $30 million in funding from the Department of Defense for adapting this technology for use in detecting the presence of biological and chemical weapons.[146] Research conducted at the Biodesign Institute by ASU professor Charles Arntzen made possible the production of Ebola antibodies in specially modified tobacco plants that researchers at Mapp Biopharmaceutical used to create the Ebola therapeutic ZMapp. The treatment is credited with saving the lives of two aid workers. For his work, Arntzen was named the No. 1 honoree among Fast Company's annual \"100 Most Creative People in Business\" 2015 awards.[147]\n\n\nWorld-renowned scholars have been integral to the successes of the institutes associated with the university. ASU students and researchers have been selected as Marshall, Truman, Rhodes, and Fulbright Scholars with the university ranking 1st overall in the U.S. for Fulbright Scholar awards to faculty and 5th overall for recipients of Fulbright U.S. Student awards in the 2015–2016 academic year.[148] ASU faculty includes Nobel Laureates, Royal Society members, National Academy members, and members of the National Institutes of Health, to name a few.[149] ASU Professor Donald Johanson, who discovered the 3.18 million year old fossil hominid Lucy (Australopithecus) in Ethiopia, established the Institute of Human Origins (IHO) in 1981. The institute was first established in Berkeley, California, and later moved to ASU in 1997.[150] As one of the leading research organization in the United States devoted to the science of human origins, IHO pursues a transdisciplinary strategy for field and analytical paleoanthropological research.[151] The Herberger Institute Research Center supports the scholarly inquiry, applied research and creative activity of more than 400 faculty and nearly 5,000 students.[152] The renowned ASU Art Museum, Herberger Institute Community Programs, urban design, and other outreach and initiatives in the arts community round out the research and creative activities of the Herberger Institute. Among well known professors within the Herberger Institute is Johnny Saldaña of the School of Theatre and Film. Saldaña received the 1996 Distinguished Book Award and the prestigious Judith Kase Cooper Honorary Research Award, both from the American Alliance for Theatre Education (AATE).[153] The Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability is the center of ASU's initiatives focusing on practical solutions to environmental, economic, and social challenges. The institute has partnered with various cities, universities, and organizations from around the world to address issues affecting the global community.[154]\n\n\nASU is also involved with NASA in the field of space exploration. To meet the needs of NASA programs, ASU built the LEED Gold Certified, 298,000-square-foot Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building IV (ISTB 4) at a cost of $110 million in 2012.[155] The building includes space for the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) and includes labs and other facilities for the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering.[156] One of the main projects at ISTB 4 includes the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES).[157] Although ASU built the spectrometers aboard the Martian rovers Spirit and Opportunity, OTES will be the first major scientific instrument completely designed and built at ASU for a NASA space mission.[158] Phil Christensen, the principal investigator for the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), is a Regents' Professor at ASU.[159] He also serves as the principal investigator for the Mars Odyssey THEMIS instruments, as well as co-investigator for the Mars Exploration Rovers. ASU scientists are responsible for the Mini-TES instruments aboard the Mars Exploration Rovers. The Buseck Center for Meteorite Studies, which is home to rare Martian meteorites and exotic fragments from space, and the Mars Space Flight Facility are on ASU's Tempe campus.[160][161] In 2017, Lindy Elkins-Tanton of ASU was selected by NASA to lead a deep space mission to Psyche, a metal asteroid believed to be a former planetary core. The $450 million project is the first NASA mission led by the university.[162]\n\n\nThe Army Research Laboratory extended funding for the Arizona State University Flexible Display Center (FDC) in 2009 with a $50 million grant.[163] The university has partnered with the Pentagon on such endeavors since 2004 with an initial $43.7 million grant. In 2012, researchers at the center created the world's largest flexible full-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED), which at the time was 7.4 inches. The following year, the FEDC staff broke their own world record, producing a 14.7-inch version of the display.[164] The technology delivers high-performance while remaining cost-effective during the manufacturing process. Vibrant colors, high switching speeds for video and reduced power consumption are some of the features the center has integrated into the technology. In 2012, ASU eliminated the need for specialized equipment and processing, thereby reducing costs compared to competitive approaches.[165]\n\n\n\n### Luminosity Lab[edit]\n\n\nThe Luminosity Lab is a student-led research and development think tank located on the Tempe campus of ASU. It was founded in 2016 by Dr. Mark Naufel.[166][167] Fifteen students from multiple disciplines were selected for the initial team.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Notable projects[edit]\n\n\n**NASA**\n\n\nA team of students from the Luminosity Lab were finalists in NASA's 2020 BIG Idea Challenge, a national competition to build a probe to explore the darkened regions of the Moon.[168]\n\n\nA team of students from the Luminosity Lab were among 22 finalists in the Space Robotics Challenge, one of NASA's Centennial Challenges.[169][170]\n\n\n**X-Prize**\n\n\nIn summer 2020, Salesforce CEO Marc Beinhoff partnered with CNBC's Jim Cramer and the X-Prize Foundation, an international mask design competition with an overall prize purse of $1 million.[171] A team of five students from the Luminosity Lab were the winners of the X-prize Next-gen Mask challenge, winning $500,000.[172][173] The team received national and international press coverage and recognition as the result of being named the top mask of the competition.[174][175]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The underground entrance to Hayden Library,[176] Tempe campus\nASU's faculty and students are served by nine libraries across five campuses: Hayden Library, Noble Library, Music Library and Design and the Arts Library on the Tempe campus; Fletcher Library on the West campus; Downtown Phoenix campus library and Ross-Blakley Law Library at the Downtown Phoenix campus; Polytechnic campus library; and the Thunderbird Library at the Thunderbird campus.[177]\n\n\nAs of 2013[update], ASU's libraries held 4.5 million volumes.[178] The Arizona State University library system is ranked the 34th largest research library in the United States and Canada, according to criteria established by the Association of Research Libraries that measures various aspects of quality and size of the collection.[179] The university continues to grow its special collections, such as the recent addition of a privately held collection of manuscripts by poet Rubén Darío.[180]\n\n\nHayden Library is on Cady Mall in the center of the Tempe campus and is currently under renovation. It opened in 1966 and is the largest library facility at ASU.[176] An expansion in 1989 created the subterranean entrance underneath Hayden Lawn and is attached to the above-ground portion of the original library. There are two floors underneath Hayden Lawn with a landmark known as the *\"Beacon of Knowledge\"* rising from the center. The underground library lights the beacon at night.\n\n\nThe 2013 Capital Improvement Plan, approved by the Arizona Board of Regents, incorporates a $35 million repurposing and renovation project for Hayden Library.[181] The open air moat area that serves as an outdoor study space will be enclosed to increase indoor space for the library. Along with increasing space and renovating the facility, the front entrance of Hayden Library was rebuilt.\n\n\n\n## Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Solar panel array on the roof deck of ASU's parking structure on Apache Blvd. in Tempe, Arizona\nAs of March 2014[update], ASU was the top institution of higher education in the United States for solar generating capacity.[182] Today, the university generates over 24 megawatts (MW) of electricity from on-campus solar arrays.[183] This is an increase over the June 2012 total of 15.3 MW.[184][185] ASU has 88 solar photovoltaic (PV) installations containing 81,424 solar panels across four campuses and the ASU Research Park.[186] An additional 29 MWdc solar installation was dedicated at Red Rock, Pinal County, Arizona, in January 2017, bringing the university's solar generating capacity to 50 MWdc.[186]\n\n\nAdditionally, six wind turbines installed on the roof of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability building on the Tempe campus have operated since October 2008. Under normal conditions, the six turbines produce enough electricity to power approximately 36 computers.[187]\n\n\nIn 2021, ASU researchers installed a passive radiative cooling film to local Tempe bus shelters to cool temperatures during the daytime by radiating heat to space with zero energy use. The film was produced by 3M and cooled shelter temperatures by 4 °C. It was one of the first applications of the cooling film in the country.[188][189]\n\n\nASU's School of Sustainability was the first school in the United States to introduce degrees in the field of sustainability. ASU's School of Sustainability is part of the Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability.[190] The School was established in spring 2007 and began enrolling undergraduates in fall 2008. The school offers majors, minors, and a number of certificates in sustainability. ASU is also home to the Sustainability Consortium, which was founded by Jay Golden in 2009.[191]\n\n\nThe School of Sustainability has been essential in establishing the university as \"a leader in the academics of sustainable business\".[192] The university is widely considered to be one of the most ambitious and principled organizations for embedding sustainable practices into its operating model.[193] The university has embraced several challenging sustainability goals.[194] Among the numerous benchmarks outlined in the university's prospectus, is the creation of a large recycling and composting operation that will eliminate 30% and divert 90% of waste from landfills.[195] This endeavor will be aided by educating students about the benefits of avoiding overconsumption that contributes to excessive waste. Sustainability courses have been expanded to attain this goal and many of the university's individual colleges and schools have integrated such material into their lectures and courses.[196][197] Second, ASU is on track to reduce its rate of water consumption by 50%. The university's most aggressive benchmark is to be the first, large research university to achieve carbon neutrality as it pertains to its Scope 1, 2 and non-transportation Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.[193]\n\n\nASU's College of Integrative Sciences and Arts (CISA) offers degrees and certifications focused on sustainable horticulture, natural resource ecology, indoor farming, desert food production and wildlife management, through its College of Applied Sciences and Arts at ASU's Polytechnic campus. CISA's Burrowing Owl Conservation Project at the Polytechnic campus was noted as one of the distinctive features of ASU in The Sierra Club magazine's ranking of ASU as the top \"cool school\" for sustainability in 2021.\n\n\nCISA faculty at the Polytechnic campus in disciplines such as applied biological sciences, and technical communication and user experience, are involved in research and community outreach to promote sustainable use of resources and preservation of species and habitat. Vertical farming, indoor farming and water conservation efforts are just a few of the sustainability initiatives being driven by CISA faculty.\n\n\n\n## Traditions[edit]\n\n\n### Maroon and gold[edit]\n\n\nGold is the oldest color associated with Arizona State University and dates back to 1896 when the school was named the Tempe Normal School.[198] Maroon and white were later added to the color scheme in 1898. Gold signifies the \"golden promise\" of ASU. The promise includes every student receiving a valuable educational experience. Gold also signifies the sunshine Arizona is famous for; including the power of the sun and its influence on the climate and the economy. The first uniforms worn by athletes associated with the university were black and white when the \"Normals\" were the name of the athletic teams. The student section, known as The Inferno, wears gold on game days.[199] Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery while white represents the balance of negativity and positivity. As it is in the city of Tempe, Arizona, the school's colors adorn the neighboring buildings during big game days and festive events.[200]\n\n\n\n### Mascot and Spirit Squad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sparky the Sun Devil\n\nSparky the Sun Devil is the mascot of Arizona State University and was named by vote of the student body on November 8, 1946.[201] Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every football bowl game in which the university has participated. The university's mascot is not to be confused with the athletics department's logo, the *Pitchfork* or hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo is used on various sport facilities, uniforms and athletics documents.[202][203] Arizona State Teacher's College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs. When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School's teams were simply known as the Normals.[204] Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in Sun Devil Stadium or other ASU athletic facilities. His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky's Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the US at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category.[205]\n\n\n\n### \"A\" Mountain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tempe Butte\n\n![](image)\nHayden Butte, also known as \"A\" Mountain\n![](image)\nAnnual tradition of Whitewashing \"A\" Mountain\n\nA letter has existed on the slope of the mountain since 1918. A \"T\" followed by an \"N\" were the first letters to grace the landmark. Tempe Butte, home to \"A\" Mountain, has had the \"A\" installed on the slope of its south face since 1938 and is visible from campus just to the south. The original \"A\" was destroyed by vandals in 1952 with pipe bombs and a new \"A\", constructed of reinforced concrete, was built in 1955.[206] The vandals were never identified but many speculate the conspirators were students from the rival in-state university (University of Arizona). Many ancient Hohokam petroglyphs were destroyed by the bomb; nevertheless, many of these archeological sites around the mountain remain. There are many traditions surrounding \"A\" Mountain, including a revived \"guarding of the 'A'\" in which students camp on the mountainside before games with rival schools.[206] \"Whitewashing\" of the \"A\" is a tradition in which incoming freshmen paint the letter white during orientation week and is repainted gold before the first football game of the season.[207] Whitewashing dates back to the 1930s and it grows in popularity every year, with thousands of students going up to paint the \"A\" every year.[208]\n\n\n\n### Lantern Walk and Homecoming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old newspaper clipping describing the Lantern Walk tradition at ASU, May 30, 1929\nThe Lantern Walk is one of the oldest traditions at ASU and dates back to 1917.[209] It is considered one of ASU's \"most cherished\" traditions and is an occasion used to mark the work of those associated with ASU throughout history. Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up \"A\" Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU's traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of \"good will between the classes\" and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university's traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to \"A\" Mountain to \"light up\" Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before Homecoming, a tradition that dates to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.[210]\n\n\n\n### Victory Bell[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ringing of the Victory Bell, Arizona State University circa 1956\nIn 2012, Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team.[211] The ROTC cadets associated with the university transport the bell to various events and ring it after Sun Devil victories. The first Victory Bell, in various forms, was used in the 1930s but the tradition faded in the 1970s when the bell was removed from Memorial Union for renovations.[212] The bell cracked and was no longer capable of ringing. That bell is on the southeast corner of Sun Devil Stadium, near the entrance to the student section. That bell, given to the university in the late 1960s, is painted gold and is a campus landmark.\n\n\n\n### Sun Devil Marching Band, Devil Walk and songs of the university[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sun Devil Marching Band\n\n![](image)Sun Devil Marching Band Battery, performing the pregame drum cadence in 2007\nThe Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band, created in 1915 and known as the \"Pride of the Southwest\", was the first of only two marching bands in the Pac-12 to receive the prestigious Sudler Trophy.[213] The John Philip Sousa Foundation awarded the band the trophy in 1991. The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. In addition, the Sun Devil Marching Band has made appearances in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl, and the Super Bowl XLII, in addition to many others.[213] Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of head coach Todd Graham.[214] It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The walk was discontinued when Graham was fired. However, in 2022, interim coach Shaun Aguano announced that the Sun Devil Walk is returning.[215][216] The most recognizable songs played by the band are \"Alma Mater\" and ASU's fight songs titled \"Maroon and Gold\" and the \"Al Davis Fight Song\". \"Alma Mater\" was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A. Dresskell, in 1937.[217] \"Maroon and Gold\" was authored by former Director of Sun Devil Marching Band, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948. The \"Al Davis Fight Song\" (also known as \"Go, Go Sun Devils\" and \"Arizona State University Fight Song\") was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics. Recently lyrics were added to the song.[213]\n\n\n\n### Curtain of Distraction[edit]\n\n\nThe Curtain of Distraction is a tradition that appears at every men's and women's basketball game. The tradition started in 2013 in order to get fans to the games. In the second half of basketball games, a portable \"curtain\" opens up in front of the opponents shooting a free throw and students pop out of the curtain to try and distract the opponent. Some of the skits include an Elvis impersonator, people rubbing mayonnaise on their chest, and people wearing unicorn heads.[218] In 2016, former Olympian Michael Phelps came out of the curtain wearing a Speedo during a game against Oregon State.[219] ESPN estimated that distraction may give ASU a one-to-three point advantage.[218]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate demographics as of Fall 2020\n| Race and ethnicity[220] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| Hispanic | 26%\n | 26 |\n| Asian | 8%\n | 8 |\n| Foreign national | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Other[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Black | 4%\n | 4 |\n| Native American | 1%\n | 1 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 32%\n | 32 |\n| Affluent[d] | 68%\n | 68 |\n\n\n### Extracurricular programs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of fraternities and sororities at Arizona State University\n\nArizona State University has an active extracurricular involvement program.[221] Located on the second floor of the Student Pavilion at the Tempe campus,[222] Educational Outreach and Student Services (EOSS) provides opportunities for student involvement through clubs, sororities, fraternities, community service, leadership, student government, and co-curricular programming.[223]\n\n\nThe oldest student organization on campus is Devils' Advocates, the volunteer campus tour guide organization, which was founded in 1966 as a way to more competitively recruit National Merit Scholars. There are over 1,100 ASU alumni who can call themselves Advos.[224]\n\n\nChangemaker Central is a student-run centralized resource hub for student involvement in social entrepreneurship, civic engagement, service-learning, and community service that catalyzes student-driven social change. Changemaker Central locations have opened on all campuses in fall 2011, providing flexible, creative workspaces for everyone in the ASU community. The project is entirely student run and advances ASU's institutional commitments to social embeddedness and entrepreneurship. The space allows students to meet, work and join new networks and collaborative enterprises while taking advantage of ASU's many resources and opportunities for engagement. Changemaker Central has signature programs, including Changemaker Challenge, that support students in their journey to become changemakers by creating communities of support around new solutions/ideas and increasing access to early stage seed funding.[225] The Changemaker Challenge seeks undergraduate and graduate students from across the university who are dedicated to making a difference in our local and global communities through innovation. Students can win up to $10,000 to make their innovative project, prototype, venture or community partnership ideas happen.[226]\n\n\nIn addition to Changemaker Central, the Greek community (Greek Life) at Arizona State University has been important in binding students to the university, and providing social outlets. ASU is also home to one of the nation's first and fastest growing gay fraternities, Sigma Phi Beta, founded in 2003;[227] considered a sign of the growing university's commitment to supporting diversity and inclusion.\n\n\nThe second Eta chapter of Phrateres, a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1958 and became inactive in the 1990s.\n\n\nThere are multiple councils for Greek Life, including the Interfraternity Council (IFC), Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), Panhellenic Association (PHA), and the Professional Fraternity Council (PFC).[228]\n\n\n\n### Student media[edit]\n\n\n*The State Press* is the university's independent, student-operated news publication. *The State Press* covers news and events on all four ASU campuses. Student editors and managers are solely responsible for the content of the *State Press* website. These publications are overseen by an independent board and guided by a professional adviser employed by the university.\n\n\n*The Downtown Devil* is a student-run news publication website for the Downtown Phoenix Campus, produced by students at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.[229]\n\n\nASU has one student-run radio station, Blaze Radio. Blaze Radio is a completely student-run broadcast station owned and funded by the Cronkite School of Journalism. The station broadcasts using a 24-hour online stream on their official website. Blaze Radio plays music 24 hours a day and features daily student-hosted news, music, and sports specialty programs.[230]\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nAssociated Students of Arizona State University (ASASU) is the student government at Arizona State University.[231] It is composed of the Undergraduate Student Government and the Graduate & Professional Student Association (GPSA). Each ASU campus has a specific USG; USG Tempe (Tempe), USGD (Downtown), USG Polytechnic (Polytechnic) and USG West (West). Members and officers of ASASU are elected annually by the student body.\n\n\nThe Residence Hall Association (RHA) of Arizona State University is the student government for every ASU student living on-campus. Each ASU campus has an RHA that operates independently. RHA's purpose is to improve the quality of residence hall life and provide a cohesive voice for the residents by addressing the concerns of the on-campus populations to university administrators and other campus organizations; providing cultural, diversity, educational, and social programming; establishing and working with individual community councils.[232]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arizona State Sun Devils\n\n![](image)Arizona State Football Team in September 2011\nArizona State University's Division I athletic teams are called the Sun Devils, which is also the nickname used to refer to students and alumni of the university. They compete in the Pac-12 Conference in 20 varsity sports. Historically, the university has highly performed in men's, women's, and mixed archery; men's, women's, and mixed badminton; women's golf; women's swimming and diving; baseball; and football. Arizona State University's NCAA Division I-A program competes in 9 varsity sports for men and 11 for women. ASU's athletic director is Ray Anderson,[233] former executive vice president of football operations for the National Football League. Anderson replaced Steve Patterson, who was appointed to the position in 2012, replacing Lisa Love, the former Senior Associate Athletic Director at the University of Southern California.[234] Love was responsible for the hiring of coaches Herb Sendek, the men's basketball coach, and Dennis Erickson, the men's football coach.[235] Erickson was fired in 2011 and replaced by Todd Graham.[236] In December 2017, ASU announced that Herm Edwards would replace Graham as the head football coach.[237] The rival to Arizona State University is University of Arizona.\n\n\n\n![](image)James Harden, ASU Basketball\nASU has won 24 national collegiate team championships in the following sports: baseball (5), men's golf (2), women's golf (8), men's gymnastics (1), softball (2), men's indoor track (1), women's indoor track (2), men's outdoor track (1), women's outdoor track (1), and wrestling (1).[238]\n\n\nIn September 2009, criticism over the seven-figure salaries earned by various coaches at Arizona's public universities (including ASU) prompted the Arizona Board of Regents to re-evaluate the salary and benefit policy for athletic staff.[239] With the 2011 expansion of the Pac-12 Conference, a new $3 billion contract for revenue sharing among all the schools in the conference was established.[240] With the infusion of funds, the salary issue and various athletic department budgeting issues at ASU were addressed. The Pac-12's new media contract with ESPN allowed ASU to hire a new coach in 2012. A new salary and bonus package (maximum bonus of $2.05 million) was instituted and is one of the most lucrative in the conference.[241] ASU also plans to expand its athletic facilities with a public-private investment strategy to create an amateur sports district that can accommodate the Pan American Games and operate as an Olympic Training Center.[242] The athletic district will include a $300 million renovation of Sun Devil Stadium that will include new football facilities.[243] The press box and football offices in Sun Devil Stadium were remodeled in 2012.[244]\n\n\nArizona State Sun Devils football was founded in 1896 under coach Fred Irish.[245] The team has played in the 2012 Fight Hunger Bowl, the 2011 Las Vegas bowl, the 2016 Cactus Bowl, and the 2007 Holiday Bowl.[246] The Sun Devils played in the 1997 Rose Bowl and won the Rose Bowl in 1987. The team has appeared in the Fiesta Bowl in 1983, 1977, 1975, 1973, 1972, and 1971 winning 5 of 6. In 1970, and 1975, they were champions of the NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship. The Sun Devils were Pac-12 Champions in 1986, 1996, and 2007. Altogether, the football team has 17 Conference Championships and has participated in a total of 29 bowl games as of the 2015–2016 season with a 14–14–1 record in those games.[247]\n\n\nASU Sun Devils Hockey competed with NCAA Division 1 schools for the first time in 2012, largely due to the success of the program.[248] In 2016, they began as a full-time Division I team.\n\n\nEight members of ASU's Women's Swimming and Diving Team were selected to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team on April 5, 2010. In addition, five member of ASU's Men's Swimming and Diving Team were selected to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team on April 6, 2010.[249]\n\n\nIn April 2015, Bobby Hurley was hired as the men's basketball coach, replacing Herb Sendek. Previously, Hurley was the head coach at the University at Buffalo for the UB Bulls as well as an assistant coach at Rhode Island and Wagner University.[250]\n\n\nIn 2015, Bob Bowman was hired as the head swim coach. Previously, Bowman trained Michael Phelps through his Olympic career.[251]\n\n\nAs of Fall 2015, ASU students, including those enrolled in online courses, may avail of a free ticket to all ASU athletic events upon presentation of a valid student ID and reserving one online through their ASU and Ticketmaster account.[252] Tickets may be limited or not available in the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 school years due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\n\n\n## Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Arizona State University alumni\n\nArizona State University has produced more than 600,000 alumni worldwide.[253] The Arizona State University Alumni Association is on the Tempe campus in Old Main.\n\n\n\n### Political figures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Carl Hayden\n![](image)Barbara Barrett\nThe university has produced many notable figures over its 125-year history, including influential U.S. senator Carl Hayden.

It is part of the State University System of Florida. With 68,442 students as of the fall 2022 semester, UCF has the second-largest on-campus student body of any public university in the United States. UCF is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.[5]\n\n\nUCF was founded in 1963 and opened its first classes in 1968 as **Florida Technological University**, with the mission to provide personnel educated in science, technology, engineering and math to support the growing U.S. space program at the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Florida's Space Coast. As its academic scope expanded beyond engineering and technology, Florida Tech was renamed the University of Central Florida in 1978. UCF continues to have space root connections, as it developed and oversees the Florida Space Institute, Robinson Observatory, manages the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, and is the leader of the NASA Florida Space Grant Consortium.[9] Initial enrollment in 1968 was 1,948 students;[10] enrollment in 2022 exceeds 68,000 students from over 150 countries, all 50 states and Washington, D.C.[11][12]\n\n\nMost students attend classes on the university's main campus, 13 miles (21 km) east of downtown Orlando and 35 miles (56 km) west of Cape Canaveral.[7][13] UCF offers more than 230 degrees through 13 colleges including the Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona Medical City, the Rosen College of Hospitality Management in south Orlando and the city campus in downtown Orlando.[14] Since its founding, UCF has awarded more than 401,245 degrees, including over 60,000 graduate and professional degrees.[2]\n\n\nIts official colors are black and gold, and the university academic seal features Pegasus, which \"symbolizes the university's vision of limitless possibilities\".[15] The university's intercollegiate sports teams, known as the UCF Knights and represented by mascot Knightro, compete in NCAA Division I and in the Big 12 Conference, except for Men's Soccer, which competes in the Sun Belt Conference.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nFollowing President John F. Kennedy's September 1962 speech \"We choose to go to the Moon\", in which he described his goal of accomplishing a crewed space flight to the Moon by the end of the decade, the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral.[17] Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher education on the Space Coast. With the help of former state senate president William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, on June 10, 1963, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida.[18] The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions. Defense scientists and NASA met with students, recruiting for the space program.\n\n\nOn January 24, 1964, the Board of Regents purchased 1,000 acres (400 hectares) of remote forest and pasture land along Alafaya Trail (SR 434) in northeast Orlando for $500,000 as the site of the new university. Local residents donated another 227 acres (92 hectares), and raised more than $1 million in funds to secure the land acquisition.[18] In December 1965, the Board of Regents appointed Charles Millican the first president of the new university.[19] With the consultation of a citizen advisory group, Millican chose the name Florida Technological University, as well as co-designed the school's distinctive Pegasus seal.[20] Millican is also responsible for the university's slogan, \"Reach for the Stars\", for the two key principles of the school, \"accent on excellence\" and \"accent on the individual\", and for the campus's unique pedestrian-oriented concentric-circle layout, which was based on plans by Walt Disney and has become a model for other universities.[21] Millican and then-Governor Claude Kirk presided over FTU's groundbreaking in March 1967. On October 7, 1968, the inaugural classes were held in the school's first academic building. 1,948 students were enrolled in 55 degree programs within five colleges, led by 90 instructors and aided by 150 staff members, during the university's first year.[22] FTU graduated its first class of 423 seniors on June 14, 1970, with astronaut and Orlando native John Young giving the commencement address.\n\n\nMillican selected the university's official colors, and had a role in selecting its first mascot, the Citronaut, a mix of an orange and an astronaut.[23] The Citronaut proved unpopular, so in 1969 the student newspaper, *The Central Florida Future*, encouraged mascot suggestions from students and faculty. The search for a replacement proved unsuccessful until 1970, when Judy Hines, a night nurse, proposed Vincent the Vulture. He served as the university's unofficial mascot for more than a year. In late 1971, students voted and selected the Knight of Pegasus as the school's official athletic mascot.[24] The nickname later evolved to the Golden Knights and eventually to the Knights.\n\n\nAfter retiring as president in 1978, Millican identified his proudest moment leading the school as when President Richard Nixon delivered the university's spring 1973 commencement address.\n\n\n\n### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nEntering office in 1978, the university's second president, Trevor Colbourn, recognized the diversification and growth of UCF's academic programs away from its strictly technological and scientific beginnings.[25] As the university developed strong business, education, and liberal arts programs, Colbourn recognized that the university's name no longer reflected its mission. From its establishment the university was known as Florida Technological University, nicknamed Florida Tech, until December 1978 when Governor Reubin Askew signed legislation changing the school's name to the University of Central Florida.[7]\n\n\nColbourn established the university's honors program, and started the university's first satellite campus[*where?*]. In addition, he was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to the UCF campus, founded in 1978. The park serves as a major focus of simulation for space and defense-related research. It was part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989.[26] Colbourn also supported the university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of growth for the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.\n\n\n\n### Hitt presidency[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1992, John C. Hitt became UCF's fourth president, ushering in an era of unprecedented growth and prominence for the university. Once known mainly as a small commuter and technology school, in recent years UCF has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standing while also evolving into a more traditional research university. When Hitt took office, UCF's enrollment was 20,302. As of 2014, 60,821 students attend classes on 12 campuses spread across Central Florida. The university consists of 13 colleges and employs more than 10,150 faculty and staff.[7] Under Hitt's direction, UCF raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.[27]\n\n\nHitt's efforts resulted in not only an increase in the university's academic profile, but also an on-campus football stadium, new arena, more on-campus housing, and the development of the UCF College of Medicine at Lake Nona. Until 1999, the Knights were represented by a jouster from the Medieval Times dinner show in nearby Kissimmee, Florida. That same year, Knightro was introduced at the staple homecoming event, Spirit Splash.\n\n\nThe past decade[*when?*] has seen enrollment increase by over 40%,[28] the acceptance rate for first time in college students falling from over 60% to near 40% in 2008, and the doubling of expected annual expenses.[7][28] Since 2000, UCF has awarded over 100,000 degrees.[7][28] It is the largest university in the nation in terms of undergraduate enrollment, the largest university in Florida,[29] and in 2003 was the fastest-growing university in the United States.[30] During its Spring 2010 graduation ceremonies, UCF awarded its 200,000th degree,[31] less than five years after awarding its 150,000th.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Colbourn Hall scandal[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2018, the state university system's Board of Governors and the Florida Legislature opened an investigation into the university for misuse of state funds. On September 13, 2018, UCF admitted to misappropriating money intended for educational and operating expenses to build the new $38 million Trevor Colbourn Hall, leading to the resignation of CFO Bill Merck.[33] In January 2019, UCF severed ties with President Emeritus John Hitt after the investigation proved that UCF had misspent or planned to misspend over $85 million between 2013 and 2018.[34] Newly appointed president Dale Whittaker, who was a provost at UCF during Hitt's tenure, resigned in February 2019 after just seven months in office over allegations that he also knew about the misappropriation of funds.[35][36] Board of Trustees Chairman Marcos Marchena also resigned that month.[37] In August 2019, the final report into additional UCF construction projects revealed the balance of misdirected funds between July 2010 and August 2018 was $99.6 million (equivalent to $139.16 million in 2023).[38] The report found that key people in the university leadership of aware of the misdirection of the funds. UCF was fined by the state for 120% the cost of the misused funds.[39]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Central Florida main campus is located along Alafaya Trail east of Orlando, Florida.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Memory Mall\nThe campus is designed to be pedestrian-oriented, with a series of concentric circles.[*citation needed*] The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus. Inside of Gemini, there is Apollo Circle, Mercury Circle, and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Student Union\nPegasus Circle contains the student union, with the John C. Hitt Library located directly to the south of it. All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini, with the circle divided up into pie-shaped sections for each college.[42] As there are very few roads inside of Gemini, many buildings' loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night. The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design, the other being the University of California, Irvine.[43] *Newsweek* ranked UCF as having the 20th most beautiful university campus in the country in 2011.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)UCF Tower student housing dorms\nStudent housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus. Outside of Gemini, the campus is divided up into different themed sections. The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities and on-campus residence.\n\n\n\n![](image)East retail and Tower III at Knights Plaza\nThe north side contains Knights Plaza, an uptown style athletic village with stores and restaurants, the east side contains the Arboretum of the University of Central Florida and the engineering wing.\n\n\n\n![](image)UCF Recreation and Wellness Center\nThe south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities, leisure pool, receation park, and more student housing. Also located directly south of the main campus is Central Florida Research Park, which is the seventh largest research park in the nation and the largest in Florida,[45] housing over 116 corporations. The park provides more than 10,000 jobs to over 500 students and thousands of alumni.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Reflection Pond and Millican Hall\nMain Campus is one of the safest branches nationally in comparison of all branches in the US. The percent of crimes in Main Campus decreased from 0.12% (in 2010) to 0.07% (in 2014) crimes per year.[47]\n\n\n\n### Regional campuses[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the Orlando campus, the University of Central Florida has several other campuses to service the Central Florida region.\n\n\n\n![](image)Rosen College of Hospitality\nIn Orlando, there is another campus, located in Downtown Orlando, the health sciences campus located at Lake Nona, Orlando, Florida. In addition, the Rosen College of Hospitality Management is located away from the main campus, in close proximity to the heart of Orlando's tourism industries near Universal Studios and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.\n\n\n\n### Downtown Campus[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, a 15-acre (6-hectare) campus was opened in downtown Orlando in collaboration with Valencia West. It includes the Dr. Phillips Academic Commons, the Union West, and the UCF Center for Emerging Media buildings.[48]\n\n\n\n### Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lake Nona Medical City\n\n![](image)UCF College of Medicine at Lake Nona\nThe 50-acre (20-hectare) UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona includes the UCF College of Medicine and the Burnett Biomedical Sciences Building. The Burnham Institute for Medical Research, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nemours Children's Hospital, M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Institute, turning the area into a medical city.[49][50][51] The campus will also serve as the future home of the UCF College of Nursing and the newly approved UCF College of Dental Medicine.[52][53] The College of Medicine welcomed its charter class in August 2009.\n\n\nUpon completion of construction, the campus could accommodate as many as 5,000 upper division, professional, and graduate students and faculty members in the health-related programs, and include up to two million square feet of research and instruction space.[51][54]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floating solar panals called \"the array\"\nDue to long-term environmental programs and commitments, UCF was named an exemplary green institution in the 2010 *Princeton Review's* Guide to 286 Green Colleges,[55] and the university has had its initiatives showcased by the U.S. Department of Energy.[56] UCF has pledged to become climate-neutral under the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment by 2050 at the latest, and to increase its recycling rate to 75% by 2020, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 42% by 2030.[57][58] Committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, all new construction must be designed and certified by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).[59] The UCF College of Medicine on the Health Sciences Campus is the only LEED Silver medical school in Florida.[60]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of presidents of the University of Central Florida and List of University of Central Florida faculty and administrators\n\nAs a part of the State University System of Florida, UCF falls under the purview of the Florida Board of Governors. The University of Central Florida is headed by the Board of Trustees, which governs the university, consisting of 13 appointed to staggered five-year terms by the Florida Board of Governors. The Student Government president and the faculty chair also serve on the board for the duration of their one-year terms of office.[61]\n\n\nThe president of the University of Central Florida is the university's principal executive officer. The office was formed upon the university's creation in 1963. The president is appointed by the board of trustees with the consent of the Florida Board of Governors and leads the university through its daily business.[62] Today, the president's office is in Millican Hall on the university's main campus, and the president lives in the Burnett House, also on the main campus. The fourth president of UCF, John C. Hitt, served from 1992 to 2018[63] and was succeeded by incumbent university president Dale Whittaker. After Whittaker resigned in 2019, Thad Seymour Jr. was appointed from his previous position as UCF's vice president for partnerships and chief innovation officer to serve as the university's interim president until the board of trustees chould choose a replacement.\n\n\nDue to cutbacks in federal, state and local budgets, UCF has had over $140 million in funds cut from its operating budget since 2008.[64] This included a $53 million cut to UCF's 2012–13 fiscal year budget by the Florida legislature.[65] So far UCF has endured the budget cuts by implementing a hiring freeze, ending some faculty perks, such as free seminars, cutting executive pay, and wise management of funds.[66] To help counter the budget decreases, the university received $18 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.[67] UCF's operating budget for the 2014–15 fiscal year is $1.5 billion, a 13.9% increase from the previous year.[7] UCF's financial endowment, administered by the University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc., was valued at $162 million in 2020.[68]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFall first-time freshman admission statistics\n|  | 2022[69] | 2021[70] | 2020[71] | 2019[72] | 2018[73] | 2017[74] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 54,977 | 48,927 | 47,957 | 45,118 | 41,816 | 37,693\n |\n| Admits\n | 22,560 | 17,797 | 21,661 | 20,016 | 17,786 | 18,810\n |\n| Enrolls\n | 7,512 | 7,091 | 8,039 | 7,323 | 7,234 | 6,860\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 41.0% | 36.4% | 45.2% | 44.4% | 42.5% | 49.9%\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 33.3% | 39.8% | 37.1% | 36.6% | 40.7% | 36.5%\n |\n| SAT composite\\*\n | 1200–1360(71%†) | 1170⁠–1350(73%†) | 1160⁠–1340(77%†) | 1170–1340(79%†) | 1160–1340(70%†) | 1150–1320(60%†) |\n| ACT composite\\*\n | 25–29(29%†) | 25–30(27%†) | 25–30(23%†) | 25–30(21%†) | 25–29(30%†) | 24–29(40%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nUCF's admission rate for first-time-in-college freshmen has declined from 61% of prospective students admitted in the fall of 2005, to 42% for fall 2020.[75] Due to the decrease in the rate of admission, UCF is rated as a \"selective\" university by The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.[76]\n\n\n34% of accepted applicants were in the top ten percent of their graduating class, while 72% of accepted applicants were in the top quarter of their high school class rankings.[77] Freshmen enrolled in fall 2020 posted average SAT scores of 1320, ACT scores of 28.7 and average high school weighted GPAs of 4.18.[78] UCF is in the top 20 percent of universities in the nation for SAT average and the top 25 percent for GPA average.[79] 71% of undergraduates receive financial aid. 90% of students receive scholarships through the Florida Bright Futures program.[80] Forty percent of incoming freshman received Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or an equivalent college credit upon entrance, while 30% of the freshman class received merit based scholarships.[80] The retention rate of the 2010 freshman class was 87%.[81]\n\n\nMore freshmen and transfer students applied to UCF during 2015 than any other public university in Florida, and UCF also awarded more bachelor's degrees than any other Florida public university that year.[82][83] UCF is ranked 2nd in Florida, and 34th in the United States, by the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled.[84] 335 National Merit Scholars enrolled at UCF for the fall 2020 term.\n\n\n\n### Classification[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Central Florida is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.[85] Its academic calendar is based on the semester system,[86] with the typical fall semester running from the end of August until the beginning of December and the typical spring semester running from the beginning of January through the beginning of May. In addition, UCF offers four different summer semesters, A, B, C, and D, ranging from six to 12 weeks.[87] The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies UCF as a \"large four-year, primarily nonresidential\" university with a \n\"comprehensive doctoral\" graduate instructional program and \"highest research activity.\"[76]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[88] | 83 |\n| *Forbes*[89] | 112 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[90] | 124 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[91] | 36 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[92] | 87 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[93] | 301 |\n| *QS*[94] | 593 |\n| *THE*[95] | 401 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[96] | 413 |\n\n\n\n\n| *U.S. News & World Report* rankings |\n| --- |\n| National Universities[97] | 124 (tie) |\n| Public Universities[97] | 64 (tie) |\n| Criminology[98] | 22 |\n| Education[99] | 58 |\n| Engineering[97] | 73 |\n| Healthcare Management[100] | 46 |\n| Math[101] | 110 |\n| Nursing[102] | 31 |\n| Public Affairs[103] | 39 |\n\n\nIn the 2023 U.S. News & World Report rankings, UCF was tied for 124th in the National Universities category (tied for 64th among \"Top Public Schools\").

Since 2013, the *U.S. News & World Report* ranked UCF's engineering, education, speech language pathology, public administration, criminology, healthcare, nursing, physics, physical therapy, space science, social work, speech-language pathology, and computer science programs all within the top 100 in their respective fields.[112] The *Academic Ranking of World Universities* ranked Rosen College's hospitality program the No. 1 in the nation and No. 2 in the world in 2022.[113] *U.S. News & World Report* ranked the university's atomic, molecular, and optical physics program 13th nationally, the nonprofit management public affairs program 25th, and the counselor education program now breaking the top 10 at 9th in the nation.[112] In 2012, the UCF College of Engineering and Computer Science was ranked 70th nationally,[114] while the College of Education and Human Performance was ranked 64th,[115] and the physics program was ranked 102nd in 2010.[116] The *Princeton Review* ranked the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA) 2nd in graduate video game design in 2012.[117]\n\n\nThe 2014 Academic Ranking of World Universities list assessed The University of Central Florida as among the top 300 world universities and the top 109 in the U.S., based on overall research output and faculty awards.[118] UCF's engineering and business schools were rated among the top 150 and the university's social sciences, computer science, and mathematics programs among the top 200 globally.[119]\n\n\nIn 2010, *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* ranked the UCF College of Business Administration as the nation's best public business school for return on investment,[120] and as a Top Undergraduate Business Program.[121] The university has also been recognized by Bill Gates as a leading institution.[122][123]\n\n\nThe University of Central Florida ranks eighth among national universities \"least likely to leave graduates in debt,\"[124] and was also ranked as one of the most economically diverse universities in 2009, 2010, and 2011 by *U.S. News & World Report*.[125] In 2011, *Forbes* listed UCF as the 42nd most-affordable university in the nation.[126] The university is also considered a top school in awarding degrees to minority students, ranking 12th nationally for total undergraduate degrees awarded to Hispanic students and 18th for undergraduate degrees awarded to African-American students.[127] UCF offers both Army and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs, which are rated among the top 15% nationally.[128]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\n#### Overview[edit]\n\n\n![A brick and glass clad building is seen alongside a street.](image)\nCollege of Sciences\n![A modern architectural style building is seen clad in stone, metal, and glass against the backdrop of trees and a blue sky.](image)\nEngineering Center\n![A modern architectural style building is seen clad in metal and glass against the backdrop of trees and a blue sky.](image)\nTeaching Academy\n\nThe university houses 13 colleges, which offer 101 baccalaureate programs, 88 master's programs, 31 doctoral programs, three specialist programs, and a professional program (medicine). In addition, 75% of the faculty have doctorate degrees, and 46% have tenure.[7][129] The 13 colleges house 41 separate degree-granting departments and schools.[129]\n\n\nBy enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the College of Sciences, the College of Business Administration, and the Health Professions and Sciences.[7] At the graduate level, the College of Graduate Studies serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university.[130] Graduate students are also students of one of the other 12 colleges at the university. The university is seeking approval for a College of Dental Medicine, which would be housed at the Health Sciences Campus in Lake Nona.[131][132]\n\n\n\n\n\n| College/school founding\n |\n| --- |\n| College/school | Year founded\n |\n| Arts and Humanities | 2005\n |\n| Business Administration | 1968\n |\n| Education and Human Performance | 1968\n |\n| Engineering and Computer Science | 1966\n |\n| Graduate Studies | 2008\n |\n| Health Professions and Sciences (originally Health and Public Affairs) | 2018 (1978 as Health and Public Affairs)\n |\n| Medicine | 2006\n |\n| Nursing | 2007\n |\n| Optics and Photonics | 2004\n |\n| Rosen College of Hospitality Management | 1983\n |\n| Sciences | 2005\n |\n| Undergraduate Studies | 2015\n |\n| The Burnett Honors College | 1998\n |\n\n\n#### The Burnett Honors College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Burnett Honors College\n\nThe University Honors Program, administered by the Burnett Honors College is designed for 500 accomplished incoming undergraduates annually. Undergraduates enrolled in the Honors College participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned research in the area of a sponsoring faculty member. Another program offered by the college is Honors in the Major, which allows juniors and seniors to conduct original research within their major and write an undergraduate honors thesis.[133] The latest Honors College incoming class had an average SAT score of 1373 and a 4.16 grade-point average.[134] Honors students have the option to reside in a specifically designed living-learning community, composed entirely of honors students, in Tower III at Knights Plaza.[135]\n\n\n\n#### College of Medicine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Central Florida College of Medicine\n\nThe UCF College of Medicine was established in 2006 by the Florida Legislature and the Florida Board of Governors to increase opportunities for medical education in Florida. The College of Medicine welcomed its charter class of 41 students on August 3, 2009, and eventually will produce about 120 medical graduates a year.[136]\n\n\n\n![](image)UCF College of Medicine at Lake Nona\nWith more than 4,300 applications for 41 available positions, UCF broke the state university record for most applications, and for 2009 it was the most selective medical school in the country.[137] For the class of 2014, there were 3,761 applicants and only 60 were accepted.[138] This initial class had the highest average MCAT score, 32.2, and GPA, 3.8, of any incoming class of medical students in the state.[139] The inaugural class had a median age of 28, with 25% of the class composed of out-of-state students.[138] The charter class completed their first year of courses on the UCF main campus, while the Lake Nona Medical City was completed. Every member of the inaugural class received a full scholarship, including tuition and basic living expenses, for their entire four years at the university, valued at over $160,000.[140]\n\n\nThe university aims for the college to become a research-intensive medical school, with the aid of the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, The UCF Lake Lona Cancer Center, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nemours Children's Hospital, Tavistock Group, and a M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Institute, all located on the College of Medicine's Lake Nona campus.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Rosen College of Hospitality Management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosen College of Hospitality Management\nMain article: Rosen College of Hospitality Management\n\nLocated near the Orange County Convention Center on Universal Boulevard in Downtown Orlando, the college's 20-acre (8-hectare) campus is designed to imitate a resort-style feel, with various areas of the college named for major donors to the college (e.g. Disney Dining Room, Universal Orlando Library, Darden Auditorium, and the state-of-the-art Anheuser Busch Beer & Wine Lab).[7][141] Regular Shuttle service is offered on most days that class is in session to and from the UCF Main Campus.[142]\n\n\nThe college features an on-site Campus Life Office and Career Services Office that coordinate on-campus activities and career development events in conjunction with the UCF Student Government Association. In 2005, the university opened two on-campus housing buildings, able to house 400 residents.[143] The college offers a variety of student organizations including associations such as Eta Sigma Delta (International Hospitality Management Honor Society), National Society of Minorities in Hospitality, the Professional Convention Management Association, and the National Association of Catering Executives, and the Global Association of Christian Hospitality Professionals. Rosen is currently ranked as the #1 in the nation and #2 in the world as of 2022.[113]\n\n\n\n### Limited access programs[edit]\n\n\nAmong the colleges, a number of undergraduate academic programs are termed \"limited access programs\" which are programs where student demand exceeds available resources thus making admission to such program competitive.[144] Examples include academic programs taught under the Nicholson School of Communication and the music, theatre, dance, and medical laboratory sciences schools or departments.[145][146][147][148] Students must apply to join these programs separately from admission to the university. Criteria for admission varies but is generally very selective and includes factors such as indicators of ability, performance, creativity, and talent. Arts programs require competitive auditions and have some of the smallest numbers of undergraduate majors in the university.[129]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John C. Hitt Library\nMain article: University of Central Florida Libraries\n\nThe stated goal of the University of Central Florida libraries is to \"support the research, teaching, learning and service commitments of students and faculty through widely-available access to collections of library resources, and to services to assist resource use.\"[149]\n\n\nUCF Libraries collections include over 2.2 million print volumes, 3.2 million microforms, 330,000 government documents, 10,000 full text electronic journal subscriptions, 660,000 e-books, 40,000 media titles, a base of 43,000 serial subscriptions, in addition to special collections and university archives materials.[7] Notable collections within the library include the Bryant West Indies collection, the Van Sickle Leftist Pamphlet collection, the Book Arts Collection, collections of materials on tourism and hospitality, and materials on the history of Central Florida. UCF Libraries is a partner within the State University System of Florida Libraries.\n\n\nMost of the print and media collection is housed in the John C. Hitt Library, which is located on UCF's main campus and is open to students, faculty and the public seven days a week. The library is five stories tall, and was the first academic building on campus.[150] Leonardo Nierman's sculpture *Flame of Hope* is displayed outside the entrance to the building, and Nierman's stained glass *Genesis* window is exhibited on the third floor of the library building.[151] In 2012, the main campus library was dedicated to honor John C. Hitt, UCF's fourth president, who at the time was celebrating his twentieth anniversary as university president.[152] In addition to the John C. Hitt Library, Rosen College library, Downtown Library, Curriculum Materials Center, and the Harriet F. Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, UCF operates libraries at nine of its regional campuses throughout Central Florida.[153]\n\n\nThe student newspaper, the *Central Florida Future*, at one time was housed on the upper floor of the library before moving to the Central Florida Research Park. In 1984, a complete renovation of the original library was undertaken, as well as an addition that more than doubled the size of the building. University president Trevor Colbourn dedicated the newly remodeled and expanded library in February 1985. A $64.4 million expansion of the Hitt Library, which would add 212,400 square feet (19,730 m2) of space, as well as an Automated Retrieval System was recently approved by the university's Board of Trustees but may be delayed due to budget cuts.[154]\n\n\nCurrently, the library is working on its 21st Century Library Project, a multi-phased plan designed to create additional space for student learning, technology, collaboration, and research expansion.[155] The project upon completion will include the construction of a four-story automated retrieval center, increased quiet study space, and the creation of additional research and writing facilities on the fifth floor.[156]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: University of Central Florida research centers\n\nThe University of Central Florida fosters research among its thirteen academic colleges and schools, partnerships with corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Disney, Boeing, L3Harris, Siemens, SpaceX, and Universal.[157][158][159][160][161] UCF also houses a satellite campus in Cocoa, FL, near Kennedy Space Center. UCF is also a member of the Florida High Tech Corridor Council.[162] The university has made noted research contributions to aerospace, optics, modeling and simulation, digital media, engineering and computer science, business administration, education, and hospitality management.[163]\n\n\nUCF is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[76] According to the National Science Foundation, UCF spent $215.3 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 107th in the nation.[164] In 2009, UCF directly influenced 26,000 jobs and $1.96 billion in economic activity.[165] When UCF's economic impact is combined with that of the Central Florida Research Park, the university and park influenced 46,000 jobs and $3.84 billion in economic activity in 2009.[165] The new College of Medicine, which opened in August 2009, will create an estimated 30,000 local jobs and have an economic impact of $7.6 billion in its first few years.[166][*needs update*]\n\n\nMetropolitan Orlando sustains the world's largest recognized cluster of modeling, simulation and training companies.[45] Located directly south of the main campus is the Central Florida Research Park, which is one of the largest research parks in the nation, providing more than 10,000 jobs. Research Park is the 7th largest research park in the nation, with 2,700 Department of Defense, NASA personnel, and direct support contractors. Collectively, those defense organizations manage $5.2 billion in contracts every year.[167] Many of the employees in Research Park work with UCF researchers and students on projects in the sciences, engineering, photonics and optics, modeling and simulation, and health-related fields.\n\n\nThe university also conducts research through numerous institutions and centers, including the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers, Florida Solar Energy Center, Institute for Simulation and Training and Institute for Economic Competitiveness.\n\n\n\n### Space Institute[edit]\n\n\nUCF founded and governs the Florida Space Institute along with government partnerships such as NASA. As a result of their contributions, 17 UCF researchers had asteroids named after them. UCF researchers found and named a planet in 2012 after the discovery of UCF-1.01. The U.S. National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center is also managed by UCF.[168] A 2015 *Aviation Week & Space Technology* workforce study named UCF the No. 1 supplier of engineers to aerospace and defense industries.[169]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Student body[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in UCF (2017–2023)\n| Academic year\n | Undergraduates\n | Graduate\n | Total enrollment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2018[74] | 56,972 | 8,726 | 66,183\n |\n| 2018–2019[73] | 58,913 | 9,168 | 68,571\n |\n| 2019–2020[72] | 59,483 | 9,553 | 69,525\n |\n| 2020–2021[71] | 61,456 | 10,002 | 71,948\n |\n| 2021–2022[70] | 60,075 | 9,847 | 70,406\n |\n| 2022–2023[69] | 58,749 | 9,210 | 68,442\n |\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[170] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 46%\n | 46 |\n| Hispanic | 29%\n | 29 |\n| Black | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Asian | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Other[a] | 5%\n | 5 |\n| Foreign national | 3%\n | 3 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Affluent[c] | 70%\n | 70 |\n\n\nUCF's student body consists of 61,456 undergraduates and 10,002 graduate and professional students and 490 M.D. students from all 67 Florida counties, all 50 states and 157 countries. Study abroad programs allow UCF students to study and conduct research in 42 programs in 21 countries.[7] The ten largest undergraduate disciplines at UCF are business management and administration, health professions and related, psychology, education, engineering, biology, multi/interdisciplinary studies, computer and information sciences, hospitality, and social sciences.[7]\n\n\nUCF's enrollment has increased by over 60% this century, from 33,453 in 2000[28] to 64,318 in 2016.[7] Of the more than 60,000 students, 11% are graduate and professional students, while women make up 55% of the student body. Nearly 20 percent of UCF faculty are minorities. According to the May 2009 edition of *Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education* magazine, UCF is one of the best 100 colleges in the United States for Hispanic students seeking bachelor's degrees.[171] 22% of UCF students are above the age of 25.[7]\n\n\nDue to budget decreases and increased demands on the university, the UCF board of trustees, with the approval of the board of governors and the Florida legislature, approved a 15% increase in tuition for the 2012–13 academic year.[172] For the 2020–21 academic year, undergraduate tuition costs were $212.28 per credit hour for in-state students and $748.89 per credit hour for out-of-state students.[173] Graduate tuition costs were $369.65 per credit hour for in-state students and $1,194.05 per credit hour for out-of-state students.[173] Tuition for the medical school is $25,490 for both in-state and out-of-state students.[173] Estimated annual cost for undergraduate students is $22,2849 for Florida residents and $38,949 for non-Florida residents. Expected costs for graduate students are $22,072 for in-state students and $38,878 for out-of-state students.[174] About 8% of tuition fees are allocated to support the university's athletic programs.[175]\n\n\nUCF has over 400 registered student organizations,[176] intramural sports, and an active Student Government Association. The university encourages student activism through organizations such as the Office of Student Involvement, the Multicultural Student Center, the Campus Activities Board, Volunteer UCF and Learning and Interacting with New Knights (LINK), an organization that fosters freshman involvement.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Students in the Reflecting Pond during Spirit Splash\nSpirit Splash is a homecoming tradition at UCF, and is traditionally the only time during the year that students are allowed into the Reflecting Pond. It has been named the best college tradition in Florida by *Florida Leader* magazine,[177] and among \"The 20 Best College Traditions\" by *Business Insider*.[178][179]\n\n\nSpirit Splash occurs the Friday before the Homecoming game, and serves as a pep rally where students descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit.[180] Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined that the best way to protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.[181]\n\n\nOne of the newest traditions on the UCF campus pertains to the Pegasus seal in the center of the main floor of the Student Union. From their first day on campus for orientation, new students are told to never walk on the Pegasus. As the tradition is told, those who step on the seal will never graduate from UCF. Usually the seal is roped off with heavy black velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal. In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.[182]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Towers at Knights Plaza\nThe university currently houses over 12,000 on-campus students in eight different communities.[183] Residence hall style suites are available in the Libra, Apollo, Hercules, Nike, and Neptune communities. All of the residence hall suites have bathrooms shared between 2 or 3 rooms as opposed to communal bathrooms. Apartment-style housing is available in the Academic Village (Nike and Hercules) communities, the Towers at Knights Plaza, the Lake Claire Courtyard Apartments Community, and NorthView. UCF also has 400 beds at the Rosen College Apartments Community, located on the Rosen College of Hospitality Management campus. The majority of all on campus housing is occupied by freshman, though The Towers at Knights Plaza house mainly upper-classmen, student athletes, and honors students.[135][184][185] Residents of the Towers Communities and Rosen College Apartments sign annual contracts to rent their apartments for a full academic year (fall, spring, and summer), whereas residents of all other standard housing communities on the main campus sign academic contracts to rent their rooms only for one or two semesters at a time.[186] Housing on the main campus typically fills to capacity well before the start of the fall semester, and cannot accommodate everyone who applies.\n\n\nIn addition, about 3,750 beds are available at the university-affiliated housing communities of Knights Circle and The Pointe at Central, which are off-campus apartment communities owned by The University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc.[187][188] and managed by Asset Living.[189] These communities contain many UCF services such as Resident Assistants, UCF Police service, reduced rent and offer shuttle service to and from campus on class days.[190] The university also administers NorthView, which is owned and operated by UCF and located directly north of the main campus in Oviedo. NorthView houses 600 students, and includes a Hillel Jewish Student Center, a Catholic Student Center, and a common space for other faith based organizations to use.[191]\n\n\nGreek housing is also available on the main campus in the Greek Park community, which consists of close to 500 beds.[192] There are ten sororities and three fraternities housed on campus, with eleven fraternities offering housing off campus.[192]\n\n\n\n### Recreation and Fitness on Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Recreation and Wellness Center\nMany different recreational organizations and facilities are available on the UCF campus. Lake Claire is an on-campus lake with canoes, kayaks, and pedal boats available for rent (free to UCF students), and a small beachfront.[193][194] In addition, UCF's Challenge Course is one of only five in the country to contain a high elements course.[195]\n\n\nUCF's main campus also boasts two Recreation and Wellness Centers. The main center is located on the south side of campus, adjacent to the Academic Village. The second gym is located in Knights Plaza on the north side of campus. The Centers are open to all students, and paid memberships are available for non-students.[196] The Wellness Centers offer programs to boost students' understanding of their health, provides discounted blood and STD testing, staffs certified personal trainers, and teaches methods to maintain good health.\n\n\nThe main UCF Recreation and Wellness Center, which opened in 2002, is a 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) building that comprises five programs: Intramural Sports, Sport Clubs, Outdoor Adventure, Fitness, and Aquatics.[197] The main recreation center includes a custom climbing wall with more than 20 different routes, as well as, tennis courts, sand volleyball courts, a disc golf course, numerous intramural sports fields, a leisure pool, and an outdoor lap pool.[198] The Recreation and Wellness Center at Knights Plaza, which opened in 2013, is a 8,700 square feet (810 m2) facility. It houses a cardio workout area, a circuit area, and a mind and body studio designed for group exercise.[199]\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Central Florida Student Government\n\n![](image)Boardwalk behind UCF Student Union\nThe University of Central Florida's Student Government (UCF SG) is an advocacy group for the students who attend the university, representing the university's approximately 70,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. It is the largest Student Government within the state of Florida and one of the largest in the United States.[200] It also often places in the top ten student governments nationally for the services and outreach it provides for the students it serves.[*citation needed*] UCF SG operates within a multimillion-dollar budget.[201] It funds and operates five campus departments—the Recreation and Wellness Center, the Office of Student Involvement, Student Legal Services, the A&SF Business Office, and the Student Union—while also providing around $1 million in funding to nearly 600 registered student organizations.[202][203]\n\n\nUCF SG was officially established in 1976 and consists of an executive, judicial, and legislative branch. The executive branch is headed by the student body president and student body vice president. Within the executive branch are between 15 and 20 appointed and paid cabinet members that oversee everything from safety and transportation on campus to governmental affairs. The student body president, by mandate of Florida law, serves on the university's board of trustees for a period of one year. The student body president and student body vice president are elected in annual elections held in the spring and both receive a paid salary that ranges from $15,000 to $19,000 per year.[204] The legislative branch is composed of 70 senators elected each spring, and senators serve a one-year term in which they represent students in their respective colleges.[205] Student senators annually elect a Speaker of the Senate, who receives an annual salary between $10,000 and $12,000 per year,[206] and a Senate President Pro Tempore. Under state law, the Student Senate allocates the university's activity and service fee budget, which was $21.1 million in fiscal year 2022–23.[207] The judicial branch consists of a paid Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices who preside over student conduct hearings and parking appeals.[208]\n\n\n\n### Campus and area transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe university campus is served by *The Pegasus Express* which serves the 11 shuttle routes on-campus.[209] The Central Florida Research Park, Rosen College of Hospitality, Health sciences campus, and the Downtown city campus are all served by the regional campus shuttles, which has 15 routes and covers 22 off-campus UCF apartment complexes as well.[210]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nKnightNews.com is the only digital student newspaper serving the UCF community, and it operates without oversight from the university administration.[211] KnightNews.com won the College Press Freedom Award in 2016 for its work fighting for open government. A print newspaper, the *Central Florida Future*, was shutdown in August 2016. The *Future,* which also ran without university oversight, was one of the largest student-run newspapers in the United States. It focused on campus and local news coverage, but also featured national and international stories. The university itself publishes two magazines, *Centric* and *Pegasus.* *Centric* is the official student magazine of the university, and *Pegasus* is the official university magazine.\n\n\nThe university has operated WUCF-FM, a NPR station, since 1978. The station broadcasts Jazz that reaches Orange, Seminole, Osceola, Brevard, Lake and Volusia counties in central Florida. They broadcast an Internet program that is heard worldwide.[212] In 2011, the university purchased WUCF-TV, which is Central Florida's only Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television station. As the region's sole PBS affiliate, the station broadcasts to an estimated population of 4.6 million people in its aerial viewing area.[213][214]\n\n\nOne limited access program at UCF is the Jazz Studies program, which launched a professional recording label for the university, Flying Horse Records. The program's faculty group, The Jazz Professors, and their student group, The Flying Horse Big Band, have both issued professional recordings since 2011 for the university label and all of which have charted in the top 50. The faculty group album \"Do That Again\" charted in the top 10.[215][216][217]\n\n\n\n### Greek life[edit]\n\n\nThe Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life at The University of Central Florida is separated into five divisions: UCF Greek Council, Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Panhellenic Council, and the Diversified Greek Council.[218] The Order of Omega has a chapter at the university.[219]\n\n\nThe Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 18 fraternities, and the Panhellenic Council is made up of 12 sororities.[220] In addition there are also many multicultural and honor Greek organizations. The Diversified Greek Council consists of 9 cultural organizations, four fraternities and five sororities.[220] The National Pan-Hellenic Council comprises nine historically black organizations, five fraternities and four sororities.[220] There are now also three recognized fraternal organizations for Christian students.[221][222][223]\n\n\nGreek life at the University of Central Florida involves more than 3,000 students in over 45 chapters.[224] Approximately 11% of current undergraduate males and 9% of undergraduate females are members of either a sorority or fraternity.[225]\n\n\nThe average GPA of Greek Life is higher than the overall university average.[226] UCF's Greek Life won the inaugural Mid-American Conference Grade Point Average Award, which is given to the university with the highest Greek GPA above their campus' non-Greek GPA. In 2003, Florida Leader Magazine named UCF the university with the best Greek academics program in the state.[227]\n\n\n**Mr. & Miss UCF**\n\n\nSince 1984 the Mr. & Miss University of Central Florida Scholarship Program has been providing scholarships and opportunities to UCF students. The program is open to all service-fee paying students at UCF who have at least a 2.5 UCF GPA. Auditions are held each year in September shortly after the fall semester begins and new titleholders are chosen in February. Mr. & Miss UCF make appearances all over Orlando and the Central Florida area, promoting their individual platforms as well as spreading school spirit and pride.\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UCF Knights\nThe University of Central Florida features a large variety of intercollegiate athletics teams, known as the \"UCF Knights\", which compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the Big 12 Conference.[note 1][228][229]\n\n\nUCF fields 15 varsity teams, 6 men, and 9 women. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, soccer, and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, rowing, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.[230]\n\n\n\n![](image)UCF's Football stadium\nThe Knights varsity teams have won numerous conference titles, and two national titles. UCF, as members of Conference USA (C-USA) between 2005 and 2013, were conference champions in football in 2007 and 2010, and women's basketball in 2009 and 2010. The women's volleyball team won the AIAW Small College Division national championship in 1978 (at the time the women's sports equivalent of NCAA Division II; the NCAA did not sanction women's sports until the 1980s), and the men's basketball team reached the Division II Elite Eight the same year.[231][232] The Knights only other national championship was in 2017, when they were named national champions in football by the Colley Matrix. While they did not play in that season's College Football Playoff, they finished the 2017 season unbeaten. The Colley Matrix was the only NCAA-recognized selector to name UCF the national champions. As none of these national titles were awarded by the NCAA, this makes UCF one of only three schools in a power five conference to never win an NCAA title.\n\n\nThe UCF cheerleading team, which is a club sport, has also captured national titles. They have won three at the College Cheerleading and Dance Team Nationals, in 2003, 2007 and 2020.[233][234][235] As the reigning national champions, the cheerleading team was followed by WE tv's cheerleading show, *Cheerleader U* in 2008.[236]\n\n\nThe UCF varsity athletic program began during the 1969–70 academic year. Then known as the \"Florida Technological University Knights of Pegasus\", the university was a charter member of the Sunshine State Conference in 1975. Since the 1970s, the UCF athletic programs have become a major competitor in college athletics. Their development culminated in the mid-2000s, when the Knights joined C-USA in 2005 and debuted a new athletic village in 2007. Advertised as \"Bringing the Knights home\", the newly developed athletic village on the north end of campus known as Knights Plaza, consisted of a new 10,000-seat indoor sports venue now known as Addition Financial Arena, the new 45,000-seat football stadium known as FBC Mortgage Stadium, a new softball complex, and the only Division I indoor football practice facility in the state.[237] The debut of the athletic village made UCF the first university to ever open a new stadium and arena during the same year.[238] The athletic complex surrounding Knights Plaza also includes Jay Bergman Field, the UCF Soccer and Track Stadium and numerous practice facilities. To coincide with the opening of the athletic village, the university also debuted new athletic logos and an update to mascot Knightro.[239]\n\n\nThe Knights football program began in 1979. UCF competed in the playoffs three times before ascending to the FBS level in 1996. The Knights have won two conference championships and four division titles. In UCF's first year in C-USA, the team experienced the fourth-best turnaround in NCAA history by winning the conference's eastern division and earning its first bowl berth in the 4th Annual Hawai'i Bowl.[240] Celebrating their inaugural year in their new on-campus stadium, the 2007 UCF Football team won the C-USA Championship for the first time in the school's history and the eastern division for the second time in three seasons, securing a berth to the school's second bowl game, the 49th Annual AutoZone Liberty Bowl. During the 2010 season, for the first time in school history, the Knights garnered national rankings, finishing the season with a top–20 ranking.[241][242] The Knights won the 2010 C-USA Championship game, securing a berth to the AutoZone Liberty Bowl in which the team earned their first-ever bowl victory, a 10–6 win over Georgia.[243][244] In 2013, the Knights joined the American Athletic Conference (AAC) as a full member, won the conference's inaugural football championship, and upset the sixth-ranked Big 12 Conference champion Baylor Bears in the 2014 Fiesta Bowl. In 2017, the Knights finished with the only undefeated season in the FBS after a third AAC Championship win and a victory over the eighth-ranked Auburn Tigers in the 2018 Peach Bowl.\n\n\nThe UCF men's basketball team started in 1969 under head coach Torchy Clark. The Knights have advanced to the NCAA tournament ten times, including a trip to the Final Four in 1978.[232] The program has won seven conference regular-season championships and five conference tournament titles. The 2008–09 UCF men's team featured senior Jermaine Taylor, who was one of the nation's top scorers averaging over 20 points per game.[245] Following a 10–0 start to the 2010–11 season, and being one of nine unbeaten teams, the Knights led by coach Donnie Jones and guard Marcus Jordan were nationally ranked for the first time in program history.[246] In the 2016-17 season, newly hired head coach Johnny Dawkins took the Knights to a semi-final berth in the NIT for the first time in school history. UCF was a layup away from advancing to the Sweet Sixteen and beating Duke, the consensus number-one seed, in the 2019 NCAA tournament, as Coach Dawkins, with his son on the team, faced off against his own previous coach, Mike Krzyzewski.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of University of Central Florida alumni\n\n![An astronaut wearing her orange mission suit with the American flag embroidered on her shoulder and name tag and mission patches embroidered on her chest.](image)Nicole Stott\n![Fernando_Caldeiro](image)Fernando Caldeiro\nGraduates include a prime minister, a Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a United States assistant secretary of state, a Deputy assistant secretary at the Department of the Treasury, a Director of the National Reconnaissance Office, and a Director of the Secret Service; in addition many members of the Florida Cabinet, Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate, two National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts, along with various NASA leadership positions.

It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. The university traces its origins to 1853[12] and has operated continuously on its Gainesville campus since September 1906.[13]\n\n\nAfter the Florida state legislature's creation of performance standards in 2013, the Florida Board of Governors designated the University of Florida as a \"preeminent university\".[14][15] The University of Florida is one of three members of the Association of American Universities in Florida and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[16][17]\n\n\nThe university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). It is the third largest Florida university by student population[18] and is the fifth largest single-campus university in the United States with 57,841 students enrolled for during the 2020–21 school year.[19] The University of Florida is home to 16 academic colleges and more than 150 research centers and institutes. It offers multiple graduate professional programs—including business administration, engineering, law, dentistry, medicine, pharmacy and veterinary medicine—on one contiguous campus and administers 123 master's degree programs and 76 doctoral degree programs in 87 schools and departments. The university's seal is also the seal of the state of Florida, which is on the state flag, though in blue rather than multiple colors.\n\n\nThe University of Florida's intercollegiate sports teams, the Florida Gators, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). As of 2021, University of Florida students and alumni have won 143 Olympic medals, including 69 gold medals.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the University of Florida\n\n![](image)The East Florida Seminary, re-established in Gainesville in 1866, was the direct predecessor to the University of Florida.\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe modern University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the East Florida Seminary, the oldest of its four predecessor institutions, was founded in Ocala, Florida.[21] The East Florida Seminary was Florida's first state-supported institution of higher learning and operated until 1861 with the outbreak of the American Civil War.[22] In 1866, the East Florida Seminary reopened in Gainesville at the former grounds of the Gainesville Academy, a small private college that had also closed during the war.[note 3]\n\n\nThe second major precursor to the University of Florida was **Florida Agricultural College** (FAC), which was the state's first land-grant college under the Morrill Act when it was established in Lake City in 1884. The Florida Legislature, looking to expand FAC's curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering offerings, changed the school's name to the \"University of Florida\" for the 1903–1904 academic year. It would use that name for the remaining two years of its existence.[23][note 4]\n\n\n\n### \"University of the State of Florida\"[edit]\n\n\nIn 1905, the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which completely reorganized the state's publicly supported institutions of higher education. Under the act, Florida's six existing state-supported institutions were abolished and reorganized to form the State University System of Florida under the newly established Florida Board of Control. Four institutions were combined to create a new \"University of the State of Florida\" for white men: the **University of Florida at Lake City** (formerly Florida Agricultural College), the **East Florida Seminary** in Gainesville, the **St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School** in St. Petersburg, and the **South Florida Military College** in Bartow.[24]\n\n\nThe Buckman Act also created two other institutions segregated by race and gender: Florida Female College (later the Florida State College for Women and then Florida State University) for white women and the State Normal School for Colored Students (later Florida A&M) for African-American men and women, both in Tallahassee.[25]\n\n\nThe Buckman Act did not specify where the new University of the State of Florida would be located. The City of Gainesville, led by its mayor William Reuben Thomas, campaigned to be the site of the new university, with its primary competitor being Lake City.[26] After a brief but intense period of lobbying, the Board of Control selected Gainesville on July 6, 1905, and funds were allocated for the construction of a new campus on the western edge of the town. However, because the campus would take several months to build, the new school was housed on the campus of the now-defunct Florida Agricultural College in Lake City during the 1905–1906 academic year. Former FAC president Andrew Sledd was chosen to be the first president of the University of the State of Florida.\n\n\nThe University of the State of Florida's first semester in Gainesville began on September 26, 1906, with an enrollment of 102 students. Two buildings had been completed at the time: Buckman Hall, named after the primary author of the law that created the university, and Thomas Hall, named after the mayor of Gainesville who had led the successful effort to bring the school to town.[27] Both structures were designed by William A. Edwards, who designed many of the university's original buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style in his role as lead architect for Florida's Board of Control.[28]\n\n\n\n### Growth, mascots, and establishment of colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An early Florida Gators football practice in 1912\n![](image)The University of Florida campus in 1916, looking southwest\n![](image)Statue of Albert Murphree, the second president of the university\nDuring his term, first university president Andrew Sledd often clashed with key members of the Board of Control over his insistence on rigorous admittance requirements, which his detractors claimed was unreasonably impeding school enrollment. Sledd resigned over these issues in 1909.\n\n\nFlorida State College for Women president Albert Murphree was named UF's second president before the 1909–1910 academic year, which was also when the school's name was simplified from the \"University of the State of Florida\" to the \"University of Florida\". Murphree oversaw a reorganization of the university that included the establishment of several colleges, beginning with colleges of law, engineering, and liberal arts and sciences by 1910. Murphree was also instrumental in the founding of the Florida Blue Key leadership society and in building total enrollment from under 200 to over 2000. He is the only University of Florida president honored with a statue on campus.\n\n\nThe alligator became the school's informal mascot when a local vendor designed and sold school pennants imprinted with the animal, which is very common in lakes in and around Gainesville and throughout the state. The 'gator was a popular choice, and the university's sports teams had officially adopted the nickname by 1911. The school colors of orange and blue were also officially established in 1911, though the reasons for the choice are unclear. The most likely rationale was that they are a combination of the colors of the university's two largest predecessor institutions, as the East Florida Seminary used orange and black while Florida Agricultural College used blue and white.[29] The older schools' colors may have been an homage to early Scottish and Ulster-Scots Presbyterian settlers of north central Florida, whose ancestors were originally from Northern Ireland and the Scottish Lowlands.[30][31][32]\n\n\nIn 1924, the Florida Legislature mandated women of a \"mature age\" (at least twenty-one years old) who had completed sixty semester hours from a \"reputable educational institution\" be allowed to enroll during regular semesters at the University of Florida in programs that were unavailable at Florida State College for Women. Before this, only the summer semester was coeducational, to accommodate women teachers who wanted to further their education during the summer break.[33] Lassie Goodbread-Black from Lake City became the first woman to enroll at the University of Florida, in the College of Agriculture in 1925.[34]\n\n\nMurphree died in 1928 and John J. Tigert was named UF's third president. Disgusted by the under-the-table payments being made by universities to athletes, Tigert established the grant-in-aid athletic scholarship program in the early 1930s, which was the genesis of the modern athletic scholarship plan used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.[35]\nInventor and educator Blake R. Van Leer was hired as Dean to launch new engineering departments and scholarships. Van Leer also managed all applications for federal funding, chaired the Advanced Planning Committee per Tigert's request. These efforts included consulting for the Florida Emergency Relief Administration throughout the 1930s.[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Post World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smathers Library, University of Florida campus circa 1945.\n![](image)Floyd Hall and Leigh Hall, University of Florida campus in 1957.\n![](image)Century Tower, begun in 1953, commemorates the 100th anniversary of origins of UF and memorializes students and alumni who died in the World Wars\nBeginning in 1946, there was dramatically increased interest among male applicants who wanted to attend the University of Florida, mostly returning World War II veterans who could attend college under the GI Bill of Rights (Servicemen's Readjustment Act). Unable to immediately accommodate this increased demand, the Florida Board of Control opened the **Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida** on the campus of Florida State College for Women in Tallahassee.[38] By the end of the 1946–47 school year, 954 men were enrolled at the Tallahassee Branch. The following semester, the Florida Legislature returned the Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and renamed it Florida State University. These events also opened up all of the colleges that comprise the University of Florida to female students. Florida Women's Hall of Fame member Maryly Van Leer became the first woman to receive from the University of Florida a master's degree in engineering.[39][40] African-American students were allowed to enroll starting in 1958.[41] Shands Hospital opened in 1958 along with the University of Florida College of Medicine to join the established College of Pharmacy. Rapid campus expansion began in the 1950s and continues today.[42]\n\n\nThe University of Florida is one of three Florida public universities, along with Florida State University and the University of South Florida, to be designated as a \"preeminent university\" by Florida senate bill 1076, enacted by the Florida legislature and signed into law by the governor in 2013.[43][44] As a result, the preeminent universities receive additional funding to improve the academics and national reputation of higher education within the state of Florida.[45]\n\n\n\n#### Integration[edit]\n\n\nFrom its inception until 1958, only white students were allowed to attend.[46] In 1958, George H. Starke became the first Black student.[47]\n\n\n\n### National and international prominence[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, the University of Florida received an invitation to become a member of the Association of American Universities.\n\n\nDuring President Bernie Machen's tenure and with the backing of the University of Florida Board of Trustees, a significant policy shift was announced in 2009 for the university. This shift involved reducing the number of undergraduate students and reallocating financial and academic resources towards graduate education and research initiatives.[48] \nIn 2017, the University of Florida achieved a notable milestone by becoming the first university in the state of Florida to rank among the top ten best public universities according to U.S. News.[49] \nIn the 2022 fiscal year, the University of Florida received more than $1 billion in sponsored research expenditures.[50] In 2017, University President Kent Fuchs unveiled a plan to recruit 500 new faculty members with the aim of elevating the university's ranking among the top five best public universities. The majority of these new hires are concentrated in STEM fields. In 2018, 230 faculty members were hired, with the remaining 270 faculty positions expected to be filled by the fall of 2019.[51]\n\n\n\n### Academic freedom controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2021, three professors filed a federal lawsuit against UF, claiming they were barred from testifying in a voting rights lawsuit against Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee and Governor Ron DeSantis.[52][53] The university claimed that testifying against the state would be \"adverse to the university’s interests as a state of Florida institution,\"[54] igniting controversy over alleged inappropriate political influence at the university, interference in academic freedom, and violation of the professors' First Amendment rights. Earlier in the year, the chairman of UF's Board of Trustees, Morteza Hosseini, reportedly pushed the university to hire Joseph Ladapo, a controversial doctor known for his support of DeSantis's COVID-19 policies and promotion of COVID misinformation.[53] Hosseini is a major Republican Party donor and DeSantis adviser.[53]\n\n\nThe reports prompted investigations by the U.S. House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the UF Faculty Senate, and UF's accrediting body, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACSCOC).[55][56] Further reporting in November 2021 revealed that the university had prohibited at least five more professors from offering expertise in legal cases, including a professor of pediatric medicine who was not allowed to offer expert testimony in a case related to masking of children during the COVID pandemic, a measure supported by medical experts but opposed by Governor DeSantis.[57][58]\n\n\nIn response to the allegations, UF's administration appointed a task force to \"review the university's conflict of interest policy and examine it for consistency and fidelity\" and reversed its decision to bar professors from testifying, stating that they were permitted to testify pro bono on their own time.[59] The recommendations of the task force were accepted by UF President Kent Fuchs in late November 2021.[60] However, a December 2021 report from the UF Faculty Senate deepened the controversy, citing external pressure and a widespread fear of reprisal if faculty promoted unpopular viewpoints and alleging that course titles on racial topics were edited, faculty were advised against criticizing Governor DeSantis or his policies, and medical researchers were compelled to destroy data related to the COVID pandemic.[61][62]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFall first-time freshman admission statistics\n|  | 2022[63] | 2020[64] | 2019[65] | 2018[66] | 2017[67] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 64,473 | 48,193 | 38,069 | 38,905 | 32,747\n |\n| Admits\n | 15,054 | 15,002 | 13,925 | 15,077 | 13,758\n |\n| Enrolls\n | 6,612 | 6,333 | 6,554 | 6,801 | 6,428\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 23.3% | 31.1% | 36.6% | 38.8% | 42.0%\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 43.9% | 42.2% | 47.1% | 45.1% | 46.7%\n |\n| SAT composite\\*\n | 1320⁠–1470(81%†) | 1310⁠–1450(81%†) | 1320⁠–1450(85%†) | 1280⁠–1440(82%†) | 1240⁠–1400(79%†) |\n| ACT composite\\*\n | 28–33(41%†) | 29–33(50%†) | 28–33(50%†) | 27–32(57%†) | 28–32(71%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nThe 2022 annual ranking of *U.S. News & World Report* categorizes the University of Florida as \"most selective.\"[68] For the Class of 2024 (enrolled fall 2020), Florida received 48,193 applications and accepted 15,002 (31.1%). Of those accepted, 6,333 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 42.2%. Florida's freshman retention rate is 97%, with 89% going on to graduate within six years.[69][70]\n\n\nThe enrolled first-year class of 2024 had the following standardized test scores: the middle 50% range (25th percentile-75th percentile) of SAT scores was 1310–1450, while the middle 50% range of ACT scores was 29–33.[69][71][72] The University of Florida has the second most selective application process of any university or college in the state of Florida, behind only the University of Miami.[73][74][75]\n[76]\n\n\nThe University of Florida is a college-sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship Program and sponsored 288 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 342 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.[77] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[78]\n\n\nIn 2007, the University of Florida joined the University of Virginia, Harvard University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Princeton University in announcing the discontinuation of early decision admissions to foster economic diversity in their student bodies.[79] These universities assert early decision admissions forces students to accept an offer of admission before evaluating the financial aid offers from multiple universities. The university's single application deadline is November 1.[80]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in UF (2017–2021)\n| Academic Year\n | Undergraduates\n | Graduate\n | Total Enrollment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2018[67] | 35,247 | 17,422 | 52,669\n |\n| 2018–2019[66] | 35,491 | 16,727 | 52,218\n |\n| 2019–2020[65] | 35,405 | 17,002 | 52,407\n |\n| 2020–2021[64] | 34,931 | 18,441 | 53,372\n |\n| 2022–2023[63] | 34,552 | 20,659 | 55,211\n |\n\n\n### Tuition and scholarships[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2018–19 academic year, tuition and fees were $6,381 for in-state undergraduate students, and $28,658 for out-of-state undergraduate students. Tuition for online courses is lower and for graduate courses is higher.[81]\n\n\nThe Lombardi Scholars Program, created in 2002 and named in honor of the university's ninth president John V. Lombardi, is a merit scholarship for Florida students. The scholarship offers $2,700 a semester for eight to ten semesters.[82][83]\n\n\nThe J. Wayne Reitz Scholars Program, created in 1997 and named in honor of the university's fifth president J. Wayne Reitz, is a leadership and merit-based scholarship for Florida students. Its yearly $2,500 stipend may be renewed for up to three years.[84][85]\n\n\nThe Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars Program was created in 2005. This is a full grant and scholarship financial aid package designed to help new, low-income UF students that are the first to attend college in their families. Every year, 300 scholarships are awarded to incoming freshmen with an average family income of $18,408.[86]\n\n\nThe Alec Courtelis Award is given annually at the International Student Academics Awards Ceremony. The award is given to international students, in recognition of their academic excellence and outstanding contribution to the university and community. Louise Courtelis established the Alec Courtelis Award in honor of husband, a successful businessman and former chairman of the Florida Board of Regents in 1996.[87]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[88] | 25 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[89] | 28 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[90] | 22 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[91] | 15 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[92] | 101-150 |\n| *QS*[93] | 168 |\n| *THE*[94] | 132= |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[95] | 98 |\n\n\n\n\n| *USN&WR* Global Rankings[96]\n |\n| --- |\n| **Overall Global University Ranking** | **107** |\n| Agricultural Sciences\n | 14\n |\n| Arts & Humanities\n | 150\n |\n| Biology & Biochemistry\n | 114\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 103\n |\n| Clinical Medicine\n | 100\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 117\n |\n| Economics & Business\n | 95\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering\n | 128\n |\n| Engineering\n | 113\n |\n| Environment/Ecology\n | 28\n |\n| Geosciences\n | 154\n |\n| Immunology\n | 129\n |\n| Materials Science\n | 170\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 185\n |\n| Microbiology\n | 62\n |\n| Molecular Biology & Genetics\n | 135\n |\n| Neuroscience & Behavior\n | 101\n |\n| Pharmacology & Toxicology\n | 50\n |\n| Physics\n | 116\n |\n| Plant & Animal Science\n | 4\n |\n| Psychiatry/Psychology\n | 99\n |\n| Social Sciences & Public Health\n | 102\n |\n| Space Science\n | 102\n |\n| Surgery\n | 68\n |\n\n\nIn its 2021 edition, *U.S. News & World Report* *(USN&WR)* ranked the University of Florida as tied for the fifth-best public university in the United States, and tied for 28th overall among all national universities, public and private.[97]\n\n\nMany of the University of Florida's graduate schools have received top-50 national rankings from *U.S. News & World Report* with the school of education 25th, Florida's Hough School of Business 25th, Florida's Medical School (research) tied for 43rd, the Engineering School tied for 45th, the Levin College of Law tied for 31st, and the Nursing School tied for 24th in the 2020 rankings.[98]\n\n\nFlorida's graduate programs ranked for 2020 by *USN&WR* in the nation's top 50 were audiology tied for 26th, analytical chemistry 11th, clinical psychology tied for 31st, computer science tied for 49th, criminology 19th, health care management tied for 33rd, nursing-midwifery tied for 35th, occupational therapy tied for 17th, pharmacy tied for 9th, physical therapy tied for 10th, physician assistant tied for 21st, physics tied for 37th, psychology tied for 39th, public health tied for 37th, speech-language pathology tied for 28th, statistics tied for 40th, and veterinary medicine 9th.[98]\n\n\nThe 2018 *Academic Ranking of World Universities* list assessed the University of Florida as 86th among global universities, based on overall research output and faculty awards.[99] In 2017, *Washington Monthly* ranked the University of Florida 18th among national universities, with criteria based on research, community service, and social mobility.[99] The lowest national ranking received by the university from a major publication comes from Forbes which ranked the university 68th in the nation in 2018.[100] This ranking focuses mainly on net positive financial impact, in contrast to other rankings, and generally ranks liberal arts colleges above most research universities.[101]\n\n\nUniversity of Florida received the following rankings by The Princeton Review in its 2020 *Best 380 Colleges* Rankings:[102] 13th for Best Value Colleges without Aid, 18th for Lots of Beer, and 42nd for Best Value Colleges. It also was named the number one vegan-friendly school for 2014, according to a survey conducted by PETA.[103]\n\n\nOn Forbes' 2016 list of Best Value Public Colleges, UF was ranked second. It was also ranked third on Forbes' Overall Best Value Colleges Nationwide.[104][105] The University of Florida is ranked among The Best Colleges in America in 2022 and positioned #8 on Money.com’s list.[106]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and academic divisions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Florida is the flagship university of the state and it has 16 different colleges.[107][108][109] UF has more than 150 research centers, service centers, education centers, bureaus, and institutes offering more than 100 undergraduate majors and 200 graduate degrees.[110][111]\n\n\nThese colleges include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **College/school founding**[112] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| College of Agricultural and Life Sciences | 1906\n |\n| Rinker School of Building Construction | 1906\n |\n| College of Education | 1906\n |\n| Levin College of Law | 1909\n |\n| College of Engineering | 1910\n |\n| College of Liberal Arts and Sciences | 1910\n |\n| College of Pharmacy | 1923\n |\n| College of Journalism and Communications | 1925\n |\n| College of Design Construction and Planning | 1925\n |\n| Warrington College of Business | 1926\n |\n| P.K.

There are over 100 courses offered exclusively to students in this program.[114] In 2011, more than 1900 students applied for 700 available seats. The Honors Program also offers housing for freshman in the Honors Residential College at Hume Hall. The program also offers special scholarships, internships, research, and study abroad opportunities.[115][116]\n\n\n\n## Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Opened in 2003, Rinker Hall was the first building on campus to receive LEED recognition. Since opening, other new and renovated buildings on campus have also received certification.\nIn 2005, the University of Florida became a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary for environmental and wildlife management, resource conservation, environmental education, waste management, and outreach.[117]\n\n\nThrough long-term environmental initiatives, the University of Florida created an Office of Sustainability in 2006.[118] Their mission is to improve environmental sustainability in many areas on campus. They have stated their goals are to produce zero waste by 2015 and to achieve Carbon Neutrality by 2025.[118] Recently the university appointed a new sustainability director. Florida received a \"B+\" grade on the 2009 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[119] In 2009, \"B+\" was the second highest grade awarded by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.\n\n\n\n## Satellite facilities[edit]\n\n\nThe university maintains a number of facilities apart from its main campus. The J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center also has a teaching hospital at UF Health at Jacksonville, which serves as the Jacksonville campus for the university's College of Medicine, College of Nursing, and College of Pharmacy.[120] A number of residencies are also offered at this facility.[120] The university's College of Pharmacy also maintains campuses in Orlando and Jacksonville.[121] The College of Dentistry maintains clinics in Hialeah, Naples, and St. Petersburg.[122]\n\n\nThe university's Warrington College of Business established programs in South Florida in 2004, and recently built a 6,100-square-foot (570 m2) facility in Sunrise, Florida.[123] The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences has extensions in each of the 67 counties in Florida, and 13 research and education centers with 19 locations throughout the state.[124] In 2005, the university established the Beijing Center for International Studies in Beijing that offers research facilities, offices, and degree opportunities.[125]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is one of several research facilities at the university\n![](image)The Emerging Pathogens Institute\nThe university spent over $1 billion on research and development in 2022, ranking it one of the highest in the nation.[50] In 2022, UF's research portfolio exceeded $1.08 billion, a value exceeded by only 15 public universities in the United States.[126]\n\n\nAccording to a 2019 study by the university's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, the university contributed $16.9 billion to Florida's economy and was responsible for over 130,000 jobs in the 2017–18 fiscal year.[127] Royalty and licensing income includes the glaucoma drug Trusopt, the sports drink Gatorade, and the Sentricon termite elimination system.\n\n\n\n\n\nUF Annual Research Expenditures per fiscal year 2015–2022\n| 2022\n | US$1.08 billion[126] |\n| 2021\n | US$960 million[128] |\n| 2020\n | US$942 million[129] |\n| 2019\n | US$776 million[130] |\n| 2018\n | US$837 million[131] |\n| 2017\n | US$801 million[132] |\n| 2016\n | US$791 million[133] |\n| 2015\n | US$740 million[133] |\n\n\nResearch includes diverse areas such as health-care and citrus production (the world's largest citrus research center). In 2002, Florida began leading six other universities under a $15 million NASA grant to work on space-related research during a five-year period.[134] The university's partnership with Spain helped to create the world's largest single-aperture optical telescope in the Canary Islands (the cost was $93 million).[135] Plans are also under way for the University of Florida to construct a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) research facility in collaboration with the Burnham Institute for Medical Research that will be in the center of University of Central Florida's Health Sciences Campus in Orlando, Florida.[136] Research will include diabetes, aging, genetics and cancer.\n\n\nThe University of Florida also houses one of the world's leading lightning research teams.[135] The university is also host to a nuclear research reactor known for its Neutron Activation Analysis Laboratory.[137] In addition, the University of Florida was the first American university to receive a European Union grant to house a Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence.[138]\n\n\nThe University of Florida manages or has a stake in numerous notable research centers, facilities, institutes, and projects\n\n\n\n* Askew Institute\n* Bridge Software Institute\n* Cancer and Genetics Research Complex\n* Cancer Hospital\n* Center for African Studies\n* Center for Business Ethics Education and Research\n* Center for Latin American Studies\n* Center for Public Service\n* Emerging Pathogens Institute\n* Entrepreneurship and Innovation Center\n* International Center\n* Floral Genome Project\n* Florida Institute for Sustainable Energy\n* Florida Lakewatch\n* Gran Telescopio Canarias\n* Infectious Disease Pharmacokinetics Laboratory\n* Lake Nona Medical City\n* McKnight Brain Institute\n* Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute\n* National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\n* Rosemary Hill Observatory\n* UF Innovate-Sid Martin Biotech\n* UFHSA\n* UF Training Reactor\n* Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience\n\n### Research Facilities[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], the University of Florida had more than $750 million in new research facilities recently completed or under construction, including the Nanoscale Research Facility, the Pathogens Research Facility[139] and the Biomedical Sciences Building.[140][141] Additionally, Innovation Square, a 24/7 live/work/play research environment being developed along Southwest Second Avenue between the University of Florida campus and downtown Gainesville, recently broke ground and plans to open next fall. The university's Office of Technology Licensing will relocate to Innovation Square, joining Florida Innovation Hub, a business \"super-incubator\" designed to promote the development of new high-tech companies based on the university's research programs. Innovation Square will include retail space, restaurants and local businesses, and residential space.[142]\n\n\n\n### Participation in the Large Hadron Collider[edit]\n\n\nA team of UF physicists has a leading role in one of the two major experiments planned for the Large Hadron Collider, a 17-mile (27 km)-long, $5 billion, super-cooled tunnel outside Geneva, Switzerland.[143] More than 30 university physicists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students and now undergraduates are involved in the collider's Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of its two major experiments. About 10 are stationed in Geneva. The group is the largest from any university in the U.S. to participate in the CMS experiment. The UF team designed and oversaw development of a major detector within the CMS. The detector, the Muon system, is intended to capture subatomic particles called muons, which are heavier cousins of electrons. Among other efforts, UF scientists analyzed about 100 of the 400 detector chambers placed within the Muon system to be sure they were functioning properly. Scientists from the University of Florida group played a central role in the discovery of the Higgs particle. The bulk of the UF research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.[144]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with Zhejiang University[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2008, the University of Florida teamed up with the Zhejiang University to research sustainable solutions to the Earth's energy issues. Overall a Joint Research Center of Clean Sustainable Energy among the Florida Institute for Sustainable Energy, at UF, and the State Key Lab of Clean Energy Utilization and the Institute for Thermal Power Engineering, at Zhejiang University will collaborate to work on this pressing issue.[145][146]\n\n\n\n### The International Center for Lightning Research and Testing[edit]\n\n\nFlorida has more lightning than any other U.S. state.[147] UF sponsors the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT), which occupies over 100 acres (40 ha) at the Camp Blanding Army National Guard Base,[148] about 25 miles (40 km) northeast of UF's campus in Gainesville, Florida. One of their primary research tools is lightning initiation from overhead thunderclouds, using the triggered lightning rocket-and-wire technique. Small sounding rockets, connected to long copper wires, are fired into likely lightning storm cumulonimbus clouds. When the rocket—or its wire—is struck by lightning, the passing of the high-voltage lightning strike down the wire vaporizes it as the lightning travels to the ground.[149][150] Undergraduate and graduate research in UF's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's Lightning Research Group is used to increase new fundamental knowledge about lightning-based phenomena.[151]\n\n\n\n### SECU: SEC Academic Initiative[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Florida is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the SECU, the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship and achievement among the member universities in the Southeastern conference. Along with the University of Georgia, University of Florida, Vanderbilt University and other SEC institutions, SECU formed its mission to bolster collaborative academic endeavors of Southeastern Conference universities. Its goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC faculty, students and its universities and advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities.[152][153]\n\n\nIn 2013, the University of Florida was part in the SEC Symposium in Atlanta, Georgia which was organized and led by the University of Georgia and the UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute. The topic of the Symposium was, the \"Impact of the Southeast in the World's Renewable Energy Future.\"[154]\n\n\n\n## UF Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance to the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville, Florida\n![](image)Academic Research Building at UF Health Shands Hospital\n![](image)Shands Cancer Center at the University of Florida\nSee also: University of Florida Health\n\nUniversity of Florida Health has two campuses: Gainesville and Jacksonville.

Out of all 56,567 students, 3,797 were enrolled through UF Online. The ratio of women to men was 57:43 and 28 percent were graduate or professional students. Professional degree programs include architecture, dentistry, law, medicine, pharmacy and veterinary medicine.[169] According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, UF has \"the largest Jewish student body in the US.\"[170] It is estimated that 18% of UF undergraduate and graduate students identify as Jewish compared to around 2% of the United States population.[171]\n\n\nA social mobility report conducted by the New York Times in 2014 found that 48% of UF undergraduate students came from families with incomes above the 80th percentile (>$110,000), while 6% came from families in the bottom 20th percentiles (<$20,000).[172] The same report also indicates that 30% of the student body came from families from the top 10% of households, and 3% came from the top 1%.\n\n\nIn 2016, the university had 5,169 international students.[173] According to the Annual Admissions Report conducted by UF in 2019, roughly 17% of the incoming freshman class was entering from outside of Florida.[174] The majority of freshmen starting at the University of Florida come from urban backgrounds with the biggest demographic hailing from South Florida cities; the metropolitan areas of Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville historically form a significant share of the incoming class as well.[174] New York and New Jersey are the biggest feeder states outside of Florida.[174]\n\n\nThe University of Florida is ranked second overall in the United States for the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to African-Americans, and third overall for Hispanics.[175] The university ranks fifth in the number of doctoral degrees awarded to African-Americans, and second overall for Hispanics, and third in number of professional degrees awarded to African-Americans, and second overall for Hispanics.[175] The university offers multiple graduate programs—including engineering, business, law and medicine—on one contiguous campus, and coordinates 123 master's degree programs and 76 doctoral degree programs in 87 schools and departments.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### PaCE[edit]\n\n\nUF launched a new program in the fall of 2015 called PaCE, or Pathway to Campus Enrollment. PaCE was designed to provide an alternative way to enroll students who would have been accepted through regular admissions, but there is not enough space in dorms or classrooms. To be accepted into the PaCE program, you would have been accepted to UF initially. PaCE was randomly given to admitted students based on major. Through PaCE, students are admitted to UF, but are required to complete 60 credit hours and all of their prerequisite courses through UF online before transitioning to on-campus learning. The University of Florida admitted 2,420 students for PaCE for the class of 2021.[178]\n\n\n\n### Innovation Academy[edit]\n\n\nThe Innovation Academy at UF is a program designed for students that want to focus on innovation, creativity, leadership, and entrepreneurship along with their intended major. Students that enroll in the Innovation Academy go to UF during the spring and summer semesters so that they can participate in internships and study abroad opportunities during the fall. IA offers 25+ different majors that all share a common minor of Innovation.[179]\n\n\n\n### Fraternities and sororities[edit]\n\n\nApproximately 5,200 undergraduate students (or approximately 15%) are members of either a sorority or fraternity.[180] Some of the fraternity chapters on campus are older than the university itself, with the first chapters being chartered in 1884 and founded on the campus of one of the university's predecessor institutions in Lake City.[181]\n\n\n\n### Dance Marathon at UF[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dance Marathon 2014\nDance Marathon at UF is an annual 26.2-hour event benefiting the patients of University of Florida Health Shands Children's Hospital in Gainesville, Florida.[182] Each year, more than 800 students stay awake and on their feet to raise money and awareness for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. In the 23 years of Dance Marathon at UF's existence, more than $15 million has been donated, making it the most successful student-run philanthropy in the southeastern United States. In 2017, DM at UF raised a record total of $2,724,324 for UF Health Shands Children's Hospital, becoming the second most successful Dance Marathon in the nation.[183]\n\n\n\n### Reserve Officer Training Corps[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Florida ROTC\n\nThe University of Florida Reserve Officer Training Corps is the official officer training and commissioning program at the University of Florida.

Since 1987–88, the Gators have won twenty-three of the last twenty-six SEC All-Sports Trophies, recognizing Florida as the best overall athletics program in the SEC.[221] Florida is the only program in the nation to finish among the nation's top ten in each of the last thirty national all-sports standings and is the only SEC school to place 100 or more student-athletes on the Academic Honor Roll each of the last fifteen years.[222]\n\n\nThe Florida Gators have won thirty-five national team championships,[223] thirty of which are NCAA championships. Florida Gators athletes have also won 267 NCAA championships in individual sports events.[224] Florida is one of only two Division I FBS universities to win multiple national championships in each of the two most popular NCAA sports: football (1996, 2006, 2008) and men's basketball (2006, 2007).\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Florida Gators football\n\n![](image)Aerial of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, also known as \"The Swamp.\"\nThe University of Florida fielded its first official varsity football team in the fall of 1906, when the university held its first classes on its new Gainesville campus. Since then, the Florida Gators football team has played in 40 bowl games, won three consensus national championships and eight Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships, produced 89 first-team All-Americans, 45 National Football League (NFL) first-round draft choices, and three Heisman Trophy winners.\n\n\nThe Gators won their first post-season game on January 1, 1953, beating Tulsa 14–13 in Jacksonville, Florida. The Gators' first major bowl win was the 1967 Orange Bowl in which coach Ray Graves and Heisman Trophy quarterback Steve Spurrier led the Gators to a 27–12 victory over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Gators football coach Charlie Pell became the target of disdain by University of Miami football coach Howard Schnellenberger and Florida State football coach Bobby Bowden, who equally despised Pell because of his notoriously bad attitude. Their mutual hatred of Pell made the Hurricanes-Seminoles rivalry earn the nickname of \"The Friendly Rivalry.\"\n\n\nIn 1990, Spurrier returned to his alma mater as its new head coach, and spurred the Gators to their first six official SEC football championships. The Gators, quarterbacked by their second Heisman Trophy winner, Danny Wuerffel, won their first national championship in 1996 with a 52–20 victory over Florida State Seminoles in the Sugar Bowl. In 2006, Urban Meyer coached the Gators to a 13–1 record, capturing their seventh SEC Championship, and defeating the top-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 41–14 for the BCS National Championship. In 2008, the Gators' third Heisman-winning quarterback, Tim Tebow, led them in a 24–14 BCS Championship Game victory over the Oklahoma Sooners for the team's third national championship.\n\n\nSince 1930, the Gators' home field has been Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, which seats 88,548 fans.

Under Donovan, the Gators won their first Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament championship in 2005, beating the Kentucky Wildcats. After repeating as SEC tournament champions in 2006, the Gators won their first basketball national championship, defeating the UCLA Bruins 73–57 in the final game of the NCAA basketball tournament.[227]\n\n\nThe Gators beat the Arkansas Razorbacks 77–56 to win their third consecutive SEC tournament title in 2007.[228] Florida defeated Ohio State 84–75 to again win the NCAA basketball tournament championship.\n\n\nThe Gators play their home games in the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center.[229] The 10,133-seat multi-purpose indoor arena was completed in 1980 and underwent massive renovations during the 2016–17 season. The arena is popularly known as the \"O'Dome.\"\n\n\n\n### Olympics[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of University of Florida Olympians.\n\nSince 1968, 163 Gator athletes and 13 Florida coaches have represented 37 countries in the Olympic Games, winning 50 Olympic gold medals, 28 silver medals and 30 bronze medals through the 2012 Summer Olympics.[230] The list of University of Florida alumni who are Olympic gold medalists includes Brad Wilkerson (baseball); Delisha Milton-Jones (basketball); Steve Mesler (bobsled); Heather Mitts and Abby Wambach (soccer); Theresa Andrews, Catie Ball, Tracy Caulkins, Matt Cetlinski, Conor Dwyer, Geoff Gaberino, Nicole Haislett, Mike Heath, David Larson, Ryan Lochte, Anthony Nesty, Dara Torres, Mary Wayte and Martin Zubero (swimming); and Kerron Clement, Dennis Mitchell, Frank Shorter, Christian Taylor and Bernard Williams (track and field).\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain category: University of Florida people\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of University of Florida alumni.\n\nAs of August 2018 the University of Florida has 545,165 alumni.[231] Over 57,000 are dues-paying members of the University of Florida Alumni Association.

Founded in 1855 as **Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania**,[13] In 1863, Penn State was named the state's first land-grant university. Its primary campus, known as Penn State University Park, is located in State College and College Township in Pennsylvania. \n\n\nIn addition to its land-grant designation, the university is a sea-grant, space-grant, and one of only seven sun-grant universities. research consortia. The university has two law schools: Penn State Law on the school's University Park campus and Penn State Dickinson Law in Carlisle. The College of Medicine is in Hershey. The university maintains 19 commonwealth campuses and five special mission campuses located across Pennsylvania.[14]\n\n\nThe university competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the NCAA for most of its athletic teams, known collectively as the Penn State Nittany Lions. Since its founding, Penn State has won 81 national collegiate team championships, including 53 NCAA titles across all sports, and Penn State students, alumni, faculty, and coaches have won a total of 60 Olympic medals, including 17 gold medals.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Pennsylvania State University\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Main at Penn State, c. 1855\n![](image)The university's Electrical Engineering and Chemistry Building\nThe school, initially named **Farmers High School of Pennsylvania** and sponsored by the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society, became a degree-granting institution on February 22, 1855,[15] by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and initially named **Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania**.[16] The use of \"college\" or \"university\" was avoided in its name because of local Pennsylvania perceptions that such institutions were impractical in their courses of study. James Irvin of Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, donated 200 acres (0.8 km2) of land in Centre County,[16] representing the first of 10,101 acres (41 km2) the school eventually acquired. In 1862, the school's name was changed to the **Agricultural College of Pennsylvania**. The following year, in 1863, the Morrill Land-Grant Acts was passed by the U.S. Congress, and Pennsylvania selected the school to be the state's sole land-grant college.[16] The school's name changed to the **Pennsylvania State College** in 1874;[16] enrollment fell to 64 undergraduates the following year as the school tried to balance its primary focus on agricultural studies with a more classic education.[17]\n\n\nIn 1882, George W. Atherton was named the school's president; Atherton set about broadening the curriculum beyond its agricultural focus. The school developed an engineering studies program that immediately became one of the ten largest engineering schools in the nation.[18][19]\n\n\nA major road in State College has been named in Atherton's honor. Penn State's Atherton Hall, a well-furnished and centrally located residence hall, was named not after George Atherton's wife, Frances Washburn Atherton.[20][21]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Main Entrance\nIn the years following its founding, Penn State grew significantly; it became the state's largest grantor of baccalaureate degrees and its enrollment reached 5,000 in 1936.[17] Around that time, a system of commonwealth campuses was started by President Ralph Dorn Hetzel to provide an alternative for Depression-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.[17]\n\n\nIn 1953, President Milton S. Eisenhower, brother of then-U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, sought and won permission to elevate the school to university status as **The Pennsylvania State University**.[22] Under his successor Eric A. Walker (1956–1970), the university acquired hundreds of acres of surrounding land, and enrollment nearly tripled.[17] In addition, in 1967, the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, a college of medicine and hospital, was established in Hershey with a $50 million gift from the Hershey Trust Company.[17]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, the university became a state-related institution. As such, it now belongs to the Commonwealth System of Higher Education. In 1975, the lyrics in Penn State's alma mater song were revised to be gender-neutral in honor of International Women's Year; the revised lyrics were taken from the posthumously published autobiography of the writer of the original lyrics, Fred Lewis Pattee. Professor Patricia Farrell acted as a spokesperson for those who wanted the change.[23]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport joined ranks with the university.\n\n\n\n![Students sit outside Pennsylvania State College (c.1922)](image)\nStudents on the campus of present-day Penn State University Park, the university's main campus in University Park, Pennsylvania, c. 1922\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Dickinson School of Law joined the Pennsylvania College of Technology in affiliating with the university.[24] The university is now the largest in Pennsylvania, and in 2003, it was credited with having the second-largest impact on the state economy of any organization, generating an economic effect of over $17 billion on a budget of $2.5 billion.[25] To offset the lack of funding due to the limited growth in state appropriations to Penn State, the university has concentrated its efforts on philanthropy (2003 marked the end of the Grand Destiny campaign—a seven-year effort that raised over $1.3 billion).[26]\n\n\n\n#### Child sex abuse scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn State child sex abuse scandal\n\nIn 2011, the university and its football team garnered major international media attention and criticism due to a sex abuse scandal in which university officials were alleged to have covered up incidents of child sexual abuse by former football team defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. Athletic director Timothy Curley and Gary Schultz, senior vice president for finance and business, were indicted for perjury. In the wake of the scandal, coach Joe Paterno was fired[27] and school president Graham B. Spanier was forced to resign[28] by the board of trustees. Sandusky, who maintained his innocence,[29] was indicted and subsequently convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts for the abuse.\n\n\nA subcommittee of the board of trustees engaged former FBI director Louis Freeh to head an independent investigation on the university's handling of the incidents. Freeh released his findings in July 2012, reporting that Paterno, Spanier, Curley, and Schultz \"conceal[ed] Sandusky's activities from the board of trustees, the university community and authorities\" and \"failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade\".[30][31] On July 23, 2012, the National Collegiate Athletic Association announced sanctions against Penn State for its role in the scandal. The NCAA penalized Penn State football with a $60 million fine, a ban from bowl games and post-season play for four years, a reduction in scholarships from 25 to 15 per year for four years, the vacating of all wins from 1998 to 2011 and a 5-year probationary period.[32]\n\n\nThe validity of the sanctions later came into question, and emails surfaced that indicated highly ranked officials within the NCAA did not believe the organization had the jurisdiction to pass down the original sanctions.[33] Subsequent emails, brought forward under subpoena, quoted an NCAA vice-president, \"I characterized our approach to PSU as a bluff when talking to Mark [Emmert, NCAA president] ... He basically agreed [because] I think he understands that if we made this an enforcement issue, we may win the immediate battle but lose the war.\"[34] On September 8, 2014, the sanctions, following a report by former U.S. Senator and athletics integrity monitor George J. Mitchell citing progress by Penn State in implementing reforms, were officially repealed by the NCAA,[35][36] and on January 16, 2015, all previous records were restored.[37]\n\n\nAn investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, whom the Paterno family retained to review the Freeh report,[38] concluded that the report that placed so much blame on Penn State and Paterno was a \"rush to injustice\" that could not be relied upon.[39] He found that not only did the evidence \"fall far short\" of showing Paterno attempted to conceal the Sandusky scandal, but rather that \"the contrary is true\".[38] In November 2014, state Sen. Jake Corman released emails showing \"regular and substantive\" contact between NCAA officials and Freeh's investigators, suggesting that the Freeh conclusions were orchestrated.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Death of Timothy Piazza[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Death of Tim Piazza\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Timothy Piazza, a pledge of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity located off-campus in State College, died while undergoing hazing activities at the fraternity. Eighteen members of the Penn State Beta Theta Pi fraternity were charged in connection with Piazza's death, and the fraternity was closed and banned indefinitely.\n\n\nThe Penn State Nittany Lions football Head Athletic Trainer played a large role in the organizing and facilitating of hazing pledges between the 2016 and 2017 academic school years.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Coronavirus[edit]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2020, Penn State announced it was monitoring an outbreak of COVID-19 as it had begun to spread inside of the United States. In February, Penn State restricted travel to China, Italy and Japan as well as requiring students returning from level 3 countries to be quarantined.[42] During Spring Break, on March 11, 2020, Penn State canceled all in-person classes at its 20 campuses until at least April 3, which was later extended to the remainder of their spring and summer semesters.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n### University Park[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of the Ag Hill Complex at the university\n![](image)Nittany Lion Shrine\nThe largest of the university's 24 campuses, Penn State University Park is located in State College and College Township in Centre County, in central Pennsylvania. Its dedicated ZIP Code is 16802. With an undergraduate acceptance rate of 49 percent,[46] it is the most selective campus in the Penn State system.[47] It is one of the most selective schools in the state of Pennsylvania, according to various publications.[48][49][50] During the fall 2018 semester, 40,363 undergraduate students and 5,907 graduate students were enrolled at University Park.[51] Of those, 46.5 percent were female[52] and 42.4 percent were non-Pennsylvania residents.[53]\n\n\nThe University Park campus is centrally located at the junction of Interstate 99/U.S. Route 220 and U.S. Route 322, and is due south of Interstate 80. Before the arrival of the Interstates, University Park was a short distance from the Lock Haven – Altoona branch line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The last run of long-distance trains from Buffalo or Harrisburg through Lock Haven was in 1971.[54] Today, the nearest Amtrak passenger rail access is in Tyrone, 25 miles to the southwest. Intercity bus service to University Park is provided by Fullington Trailways, Greyhound Lines, Megabus, and OurBus. The University Park Airport, serving four regional airlines, is near University Park.\n\n\n\n### Commonwealth campuses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses\n\n![Pennsylvania State University is located in Pennsylvania](image)![Behrend](image)\nBehrend\n![Abington](image)\nAbington\n![Altoona](image)\nAltoona\n![Beaver](image)\nBeaver\n![Berks](image)\nBerks\n![Brandywine](image)\nBrandywine\n![DuBois](image)\nDuBois\n![Fayette](image)\nFayette\n![Allegheny](image)\nAllegheny\n![Harrisburg](image)\nHarrisburg\n![Hazleton](image)\nHazleton\n![Lehigh Valley](image)\nLehigh Valley\n![Mont Alto](image)\nMont Alto\n![New Kensington](image)\nNew Kensington\n![Schuylkill](image)\nSchuylkill\n![Scranton](image)\nScranton\n![Shenango](image)\nShenango\n![Wilkes-Barre](image)\nWilkes-Barre\n![York](image)\nYork\n![Great Valley](image)\nGreat Valley\n![University Park](image)\nUniversity Park\nclass=notpageimage|\nMap depicting the locations of Penn State's 19 commonwealth campuses and the University Park campus\n\nIn addition to the University Park campus, 19 campus locations throughout the commonwealth of Pennsylvania offer enrollment for undergraduate students. Over 60 percent of Penn State first-year students begin their education at a location other than University Park.[55] Each of the 19 commonwealth campuses offer a unique set of degree programs based on the student demographics. Any student in good academic standing is guaranteed a spot at University Park to finish his or her degree if required or desired, known as \"change of campus\" or, more accurately, \"the 2+2 program\"; where a Penn State student may start at any Penn State campus, including University Park, for two years and finish at any Penn State the final two years.[56]\n\n\n\n### Special mission campuses and World Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn State Dickinson Law in Carlisle\n![](image)The Main Building at Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies in East Whiteland Township\n#### Special mission campuses[edit]\n\n\n* Dickinson Law, founded in 1834 as The Dickinson School of Law in Carlisle, is the oldest law school in Pennsylvania[57] and the fifth-oldest in the country. Since its founding, its graduates have included several notable attorneys, judges, government and corporate leaders, and legal educators. Dickinson School of Law's 1997 merger with Penn State was completed in 2000. It expanded its reputation, network, and joint degree programs complementing Dickinson Law's legacy as an innovative leader in experiential education.[58] In 2006, a second campus was opened at University Park. The school was split in 2014 into two separately accredited law schools: Dickinson Law in Carlisle and Penn State Law at University Park.[59] The last students to attend the dual-campus Penn State Dickinson School of Law graduated in May 2017.[60]\n* The Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies is a special mission campus offering master's degrees, graduate certification, and continuing professional education. Located in Malvern, Pennsylvania, it also offers classes at the old Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.\n* Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, is the university's medical school and teaching hospital. Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center became the ninth hospital in the United States and 16th worldwide to implant the \"CardioWest temporary Total Artificial Heart\" when a 60-year-old man suffering from end-stage heart failure received the device in May 2008.\n* Pennsylvania College of Technology, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, offers certificates as well as degrees in over ten technical fields. Pennsylvania College of Technology became an affiliate of The Pennsylvania State University in 1989.\n\n\n#### World Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn State World Campus\n\nIn 1998, the university launched Penn State World Campus, or Penn State Online, which offers more than 60 online education programs, degrees, and certificates. Distance education has a long history at Penn State, one of the first universities in the country to offer a correspondence course for remote farmers in 1892. Examples of online programs include an MBA, a master of professional studies in homeland security, a Bachelor of Science in nursing, and post-baccalaureate certificates in geographic information systems and applied behavior analysis.[61]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\nPenn State is a state-related university and a member of Pennsylvania's Commonwealth System of Higher Education. While it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, howver, it is otherwise independent and not subject to any direct control by the state. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.[62] Initial reports concerning the 2007–2008 fiscal year indicated that Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell is recommending a 1.6 percent increase in state appropriations.[63] Penn State's appropriation request, submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September, requested a 6.8 percent increase in funding.[64][*needs update*]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schreyer Honors College\n![](image)Carnegie Building\n![](image)Huck Institute of the Life Sciences: Gateway to the Sciences\nPenn State has eighteen colleges, including three at special-mission campuses. The University Park campus is organized into fourteen distinct colleges, plus the graduate school and the division of undergraduate studies:[65]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * College of Agricultural Sciences\n* College of Arts and Architecture\n* Smeal College of Business\n* Donald P.

Its members include the university's president, the Governor of the Commonwealth, and the state Secretaries of Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and Education. The other members include six trustees appointed by the Governor, nine elected by alumni, and six elected by Pennsylvania agricultural societies. Six additional trustees are elected by a board representing business and industry enterprises.[69] Undergraduate students do not elect any trustees; the court case *Benner v. Oswald* ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of trustees.\n\n\nAs of 2013[update], the chair of the board of trustees is Keith E. Masser, a graduate of Penn State and the chairman and chief executive officer of Sterman Masser, Inc.[70]\n\n\nThe board's main responsibilities are to select the president of Penn State, determine the goals and strategic direction of the university, and approve the annual budget.[71] Regular meetings of the board are held bi-monthly and take place primarily on the University Park campus, although on occasion meetings are held at other locations within the Commonwealth.[72]\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Presidents of Pennsylvania State University\n\n![](image)Old Main, the main administrative building of Penn State, located on the university's main campus\nThe university president is selected by the board and is given the authority for actual control of the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, part of this responsibility is delegated by the president to other administrative departments, the faculty, and the student body.[71] Neeli Bendapudi became the university's 19th and current president on May 9, 2022, upon the departure of Eric J. Barron.[4] The executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the university. The current provost, Nicholas P. Jones, assumed office on July 1, 2013.[73]\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HUB-Robeson Center, Penn State's student union center on the main campus\nPenn State has a long history of student governance. Elected student leaders remain directly involved in the decision-making of the university administration, as provided for in the board of trustees' standing orders.[74] There are four student governments recognized by the university administration: the University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA), the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), and the World Campus Student Government Association (WCSGA).[75]\n\n\nThe University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) is the representative student government of the undergraduate students at Penn State's University Park campus, which was established in 2006 after the former student government, Undergraduate Student Government (USG), lost its recognition by way of a student referendum.[76] Graduate and professional students at the university are represented by the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), the oldest continuously existing student governance organization at Penn State.[77]\n\n\nThe 19 commonwealth campuses of the university are governed by the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), formerly known as the Council of Branch Campus Student Governments (CBCSG).[78]\n\n\nIn 2019, the World Campus Student Government Association (WCSGA) was formed to advocate for the interests and concerns of the more than 20,000 Penn State World Campus students.[79]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n#### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[80]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 57.6 |\n| Yield rate | 19.0 |\n| Test scores middle 50%[i] |\n| SAT Total | 1200-1400(among 37% of FTFs) |\n| ACT Composite | 26-32(among 8% of FTFs) |\n| 1. **^** Among students who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nThe 2022 annual ranking of *U.S. News & World Report* categorizes The Pennsylvania State University as \"selective\".[81] For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), Penn State received 78,578 applications and accepted 45,269 for an acceptance rate of 57.6%. Of those accepted, 8,614 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 19.0%. Penn State's freshman retention rate is 93.1%, with 85% going on to graduate within six years.[80]\n\n\nThe university started test-optional admissions with the Fall 2021 incoming class in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and extended this through Fall 2023. Of the 37% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores, the middle 50 percent had composite scores between 1200 and 1400. Of the 8% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores, the middle 50 percent composite score was between 26 and 32.[80]\n\n\nPennsylvania State University-University Park is a college-sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship Program and sponsored five Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 16 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.[82]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Fall First-Time Freshman Statistics**\n[80]\n[83]\n[84]\n|  | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 78,578 | 73,861 | 71,903 | 52,742 | 56,114\n |\n| Admits\n | 45,269 | 40,031 | 35,302 | 29,793 | 28,233\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 57.6 | 54.2 | 49.1 | 56.5 | 50.3\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 8,614 | 8,465 | 8,331 | 8,075 | 7,863\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 19.0 | 21.1 | 23.6 | 27.1 | 27.9\n |\n| ACT composite\\*(out of 36) | 26-32(8%†) | 25-30(18%†) | 25-30(17%†) | 25-30(22%†) | 25-30(30%†) |\n| SAT composite\\*(out of 1600) | 1200-1400(37%†) | 1150-1340(77%†) | 1160-1370(78%†) | 1160-1360(74%†) | 1160-1340(65%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\n### Academic divisions[edit]\n\n\nPenn State is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

For fiscal year 2013, according to institutional rankings of total research expenditures for science and engineering released by the National Science Foundation, Penn State stood second in the nation, behind only Johns Hopkins and tied with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the number of fields in which it is ranked in the top ten. Overall, Penn State ranked 17th nationally in total research expenditures across the board. In 12 individual fields; however, the university achieved rankings in the top ten nationally. The fields and sub-fields in which Penn State ranked in the top ten are materials (1st), psychology (2nd), mechanical engineering (3rd), sociology (3rd), electrical engineering (4th), total engineering (5th), aerospace engineering (8th), computer science (8th), agricultural sciences (8th), civil engineering (9th), atmospheric sciences (9th), and earth sciences (9th). Moreover, in eleven of these fields, the university has repeated top-ten status every year since at least 2008.[103] For fiscal year 2011, the National Science Foundation reported that Penn State had spent $794.846 million on R&D and ranked 15th among U.S. universities and colleges in R&D spending.[104]\n\n\nFor the 2008–2009 fiscal year, Penn State was ranked ninth among U.S. universities by the National Science Foundation, with $753 million in research and development spending for science and engineering.[105] During the 2015–2016 fiscal year, Penn State received $836 million in research expenditures.[106]\n\n\nThe Applied Research Lab (ARL), located near the University Park campus, has been a research partner with the United States Department of Defense since 1945 and conducts research primarily in support of the United States Navy. It is the largest component of Penn State's research efforts statewide, with over 1,000 researchers and other staff members.[107][108]\n\n\nThe Materials Research Institute (MRI) was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State's University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial, and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM), which supported many faculty and students from the college of earth and mineral science, the Eberly College of Science, the college of engineering, the materials research laboratory and the applied research laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in creating the Materials Research Institute, and the establishment of Penn State as an acknowledged leader among major universities in materials education and research.[109][110][111]\n\n\nThe university was one of the founding members of the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN), a partnership that includes 17 research-led universities in the United States, Asia, and Europe. The network provides funding, facilitates collaboration between universities, and coordinates exchanges of faculty members and graduate students among institutions. Former Penn State president Graham Spanier is a former vice-chair of the WUN.[112][113]\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University Libraries were ranked 14th among research libraries in North America in the 2003–2004 survey released by The Chronicle of Higher Education.[114] The university's library system began with a 1,500-book two-room library in Old Main,[115] but moved to its own space – Carnegie Library (named after college trustee Andrew Carnegie) – ten years later.[116] In 2009, its holdings had grown to 5.2 million volumes, in addition to 500,000 maps, five million microforms, and 180,000 films and videos.[117] The university is a member of the Center for Research Libraries.\n\n\nThe university's College of Information Sciences and Technology is the home of CiteSeerX, an open-access repository and search engine for scholarly publications. The university is also the host to the Radiation Science & Engineering Center, which houses the oldest operating university research reactor. Additionally, University Park houses the Graduate Program in Acoustics,[118] the only freestanding acoustics program in the United States. The university also houses the Center for Medieval Studies, a program that was founded to research and study the European Middle Ages,[119] and the Center for the Study of Higher Education (CSHE), one of the first centers established to research postsecondary education. It is a member of the CDIO Initiative, an international network of universities working to develop unique teaching methods in engineering. The university is also a member of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, an organization of hundreds of leading universities dedicated to researching atmosphere and climatology.\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Student demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[120] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 65%\n | 65 |\n| Foreign national | 8%\n | 8 |\n| Hispanic | 8%\n | 8 |\n| Asian | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Black | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Other[a] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Affluent[c] | 77%\n | 77 |\n\n\nAs of fall 2010, the racial makeup of the Penn State system including all campuses and special-mission colleges, was 75.4 percent white, 5.5 percent black, 4.3 percent Asian, 4.4 percent Hispanic, 0.2 percent Native American, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 1.7 percent two or more races, 5.8 percent international students and 3.1 percent of an unknown race. Over the period 2000–2010, minority enrollment as a percentage of total enrollments has risen 5.3 percentage points,[121] while minorities as a percentage of total teaching positions rose 2.0 percentage points from 1997 to 2002.[122]\n\n\nPenn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main. They demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus and the local community. After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang \"We Shall Overcome\", arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.[123] All charges were later dismissed.\n\n\nIn 1990 a vice provost for educational equity was appointed to lead a five-year strategic plan to \"create an environment characterized by equal access and respected participation for all groups and individuals irrespective of cultural differences.\"[124][125] Since then, discrimination issues include the handling of death threats in 1992 and 2001,[126][127][128][129] controversy around LGBT issues,[130] and the investigation of a 2006 sexual discrimination lawsuit filed by former Lady Lions basketball player Jennifer Harris, alleging that head coach Rene Portland dismissed her from the team in part due to her perceived sexual orientation.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Irvin residence hall in West Halls\n![](image)Brill Hall\nThere are seven housing complexes on campus for students attending the University Park campus: East Halls, North Halls, Pollock Halls, South Halls, West Halls, Eastview Terrace, and Nittany Apartments. Each complex consists of a few separate buildings that are dormitories and a commons building, which has: lounges, the help desk for the complex, mailboxes for each dormitory room, a convenience store, a food court, an all-you-care-to-eat buffet. Different floors within a building may be designated as a Special Living Option (SLO). SLOs are offered to members of certain student groups (such as sororities), students studying particular majors, students who wish to engage in a particular lifestyle (such as the alcohol-free LIFE House), or other groups who wish to pursue similar goals.\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nAs of September 2014[update], 864 student organizations were recognized at the University Park campus.[133] In addition, the university has one of the largest Greek systems in the country, with approximately 12 percent of the University Park population affiliated. Additional organizations on campus include Thespians, Blue Band, Chabad, Glee Club, Aish HaTorah,[134] Student Programming Association (SPA), Lion's Pantry, Boulevard, Apollo, 3D Printer Club, Digi Digits, and the Anime Organization, which hosts an annual Central Pennsylvania-based anime convention, Setsucon.[135]\n\n\n\n#### THON[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2007 Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon\nAnnually in February, thousands of students participate in the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (THON), the largest student-run philanthropy in the world.[136] Every year, participants stand for 46 hours nonstop and perform a line dance at least once every hour to stay alert alongside other events hosted throughout the weekend such as concerts, games, athlete hour, family hour, and a tribute to all of the children with cancer. In 2007, THON was moved to the Bryce Jordan Center and now lasts 46 hours. THON raises millions of dollars annually for childhood cancer care and research for its sole beneficiary, Four Diamonds. In 2023, THON raised a program record of $15 million.[137]\n\n\n\n#### The Lion's Pantry[edit]\n\n\nThe Lion's Pantry is an undergraduate student-run on-campus food pantry and registered student organization. The Lion's Pantry serves undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. With increasing awareness of hunger on college campuses, the Lion's Pantry is one of the nation's most successful startup food pantries. They partner with groups ranging from Boulevard, UPUA, Greek Life, and more to receive over 8,000 food donations a year. The club was also awarded the Class Gift of 2017 in the form of an endowment.[138]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nTwenty two of Penn State's campuses are served by Penn State University Police and Public Safety. In addition to being a full-service police department, the department also has specialized units such as K9, criminal investigation, bike patrol, a bomb squad, and drones. The police department was founded in 1926 as Campus Patrol.\n\n\nPenn State University Park is also served by the Penn State University Ambulance Service, known as Centre County Company 20. Penn State EMS is a full-service, licensed ambulance service, staffed by student EMTs. The ambulance is staffed 24/7/365 with the exception of the annual winter break when it goes out of service. The ambulance is affiliated with the University Health Service.\n\n\n\n### Student media[edit]\n\n\nStudent media groups on campus include *The Daily Collegian*, Penn State's student-run newspaper; *Onward State*, a student-run blog; *The Underground*, a multi-cultural student media site; The LION 90.7 FM (WKPS-FM), a student-run radio station; CommRadio, a student-run, internet-based radio program; *La Vie*, the university's annual student yearbook; *Kalliope*, a student-produced literary journal; *Valley*, a student-run style and life magazine; *Phroth*, a student-run humor magazine; and *Penn State Live*, the official news source of the university published by its public relations team.\n\n\n*The Daily Collegian* has continuously been ranked as one of the top college newspapers by the Princeton Review. The paper, founded in 1904, provides news, sports, and arts coverage and produces long-form features. It publishes in print on Mondays and Thursdays while classes are in session. Since the summer of 1996, the traditional paper publication has been supplemented by an online edition. Online content is published every day. Penn State's commonwealth campuses receive a weekly copy of the paper titled *The Weekly Collegian*.\n\n\n*Onward State* is a student-run blog geared towards the university's community members. The blog, which was founded in 2008, provides news, event coverage, and opinion pieces. *U.S. News & World Report* named the blog the \"Best Alternative Media Outlet\" in February 2009.\n\n\nThe Underground is a multicultural student-run media site devoted to telling the untold stories within the Penn State community. The publication seeks to foster the multicultural student voice through creating an open forum of discussion and promoting diversity and community involvement. The media site was founded in 2015.\n\n\nThe LION 90.7 FM (WKPS-FM) was founded in 1995 as a replacement for Penn State's original student radio station WDFM. The LION broadcasts from the ground floor of the HUB-Robeson Center, serving the Penn State and State College communities with alternative music and talk programming, including live coverage of home Penn State football games.\n\n\nCommRadio is operated by the Penn State College of Communications. It was founded in the spring of 2003 as an internet-based audio laboratory and co-curricular training environment for aspiring student broadcasters. It airs both sports coverage and news. Other programming includes student talk shows, political coverage, AP syndicated news, and soft rock music. In recent years, ComRadio broadcasters have won numerous state awards for their on-air work.\n\n\n*La Vie* (the Life), the university's annual student yearbook, has been published continuously since 1890.[139] *La Vie 1987,* edited by David Beagin, won a College Gold Crown for Yearbooks award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association.[140]\n\n\n*Kalliope* is an undergraduate literary journal produced by students and sponsored by the university's English Department. It is published in the spring. *Kalliope* includes works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and visual art.[141] In addition, *Klio*, an online publication, provides students with literary pieces in the fall semester.\n\n\n*Valley* is Penn State's student-run life and style magazine.[142] It was founded in 2007.\n\n\nThe student-run humor magazine, founded in 1909 as *Froth*, is *Phroth*, which publishes two to four issues each year. Notable Penn State alumni who worked at the magazine include Julius J. Epstein, who wrote the screenplay for *Casablanca* in 1942 and won three Academy Awards.[143]\n\n\nPenn State's newspaper readership program provides free copies of *USA Today*, *The New York Times*, and local and regional newspapers depending on the campus location. This program, initiated by then-President Graham Spanier in 1997,[144] has since been instituted on several other universities across the country.[145]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn State Nittany Lions\n\n![](image)Wall near Beaver Stadium\n![](image)The \"S-Zone\", representing \"State\", in the student section\nPenn State's mascot is the Nittany Lion, a representation of a type of mountain lion that once roamed what is now University Park. The school's official colors, now blue and white, were originally black and dark pink. Originally introduced back when athletics were introduced at Penn State, this was changed in 1890 after the pink faded to white and to avoid ridicule from opposing teams.[146] Pink and black still will make periodic appearances at athletic events in the modern era as a special student \"S\" section during certain games. Penn State participates in the NCAA Division I FBS and in the Big Ten Conference for most sports.[147]\n\n\nTwo sports participate in different conferences: men's volleyball in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA)[148] and women's hockey in College Hockey America (CHA).[149] The fencing teams operate as independents.\n\n\nPenn State athletic teams have claimed a total of 81 national collegiate team championships since the university's founding, including 53 NCAA, two consensus Division I football titles, six AIAW, three USWLA, one WIBC, four national titles in boxing, 11 in men's soccer, and one in wrestling in years prior to NCAA sponsorship.[150] The university ranks fifth all-time in NCAA championships in NCAA Division I, and first among Big Ten schools.[151]\n\n\nSince joining the Big Ten in 1991, Penn State teams have won 124 conference regular season and tournament titles, through June, 2023.[152]\n\n\nPenn State has one of the most successful overall athletic programs in the country, evidenced by its rankings in the NACDA Director's Cup, a list compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. From the Cup's inception in the 1993–1994 season, the Nittany Lions have finished in the top 25 every year.[153]\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nDespite widespread success in the overall athletic program, the school is best known for its football team, which enjoys a very large following. Penn State's Beaver Stadium has the second-largest seating capacity of any stadium in the nation, and the fourth-largest seating capacity of any stadium in the world.[154] With an official capacity of 106,572, Beaver Stadium is slightly behind Michigan Stadium, whose official capacity is slightly higher at 107,601. \n\n\nFor decades, the Penn State football team was led by coach Joe Paterno, who was in a close competition with Bobby Bowden, head coach for Florida State, for the most wins ever in Division I-A (now the FBS) history. Paterno still led in total wins at the time of Bowden's retirement following the 2010 Gator Bowl. In 2007, Patero was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[155]\n\n\nPaterno amassed 409 victories over his career, the most in NCAA Division I history.[156] Paterno died on January 22, 2012, at the age of 85. Paterno was posthumously honored by Penn State during the September 17, 2016 football game that marked the 50th anniversary of his first game as head coach.[157][158][159][160]\n\n\n\nThe university opened a new Penn State All-Sports Museum in February 2002. This two-level 10,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) museum is located inside Beaver Stadium.[161]\n\n![Beaver Stadium](image)\nBeaver Stadium\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor the list of notable past and present individuals associated with Penn State, including alumni, faculty, and athletic staff, see: list of Pennsylvania State University people.\n\n\n\n* ![Kelly Ayotte, former U.S. Senator](image)\n\nKelly Ayotte, former U.S. Senator\n* ![Saquon Barkley, professional football player, New York Giants](image)\n\nSaquon Barkley, professional football player, New York Giants\n* ![Paul Berg, biochemist and Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner](image)\n\nPaul Berg, biochemist and Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner\n* ![Guion Bluford, first African American to go to space](image)\n\nGuion Bluford, first African American to go to space\n* ![Ty Burrell, actor](image)\n\nTy Burrell, actor\n* ![Charlie Dent, former U.S. Representative](image)\n\nCharlie Dent, former U.S. Representative\n* ![Mike Doyle, former U.S. Representative](image)\n\nMike Doyle, former U.S. Representative\n* ![Julius J.

About 34 percent of United States alumni and 21 percent of international alumni are members of the Alumni Association.[166][167] With membership totaling 176,426 as of FY2016, the Penn State Alumni Association is the largest dues-paying alumni association in the world, a distinction it has held since 1995.[168]\n\n\nSince 2001, the university, along with all schools in the Big Ten, has participated in the \"Big Ten Challenge\" website, which is a \"competitive\" clearinghouse of alumni donation statistics for member schools. Results are tracked to determine a percentage of each school's alumni from the previous decade who gave to their alma mater each calendar year (during the 2005–2006 year, alumni donations from 1996 to 2005 were tallied). With the exception of 2005–2006, when Penn State fell to second behind Northwestern University,[169] Penn State has won the challenge each year since its inception.[170][171][172][173]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* Palmer Museum of Art\n* List of colleges and universities in Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Other consists of Multiracial Americans & those who prefer to not say.\n2. **^** The percentage of students who received an income-based federal Pell grant intended for low-income students.\n3. **^** The percentage of students who are a part of the American middle class at the bare minimum.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** U.S. ENDOWMENT RETURNS TRACKER (Report).
