The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.[6] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[7] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[8] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2\u20131 in a tense final in Paris.[9] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.[10] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[11]\n\n\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[12] West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war.[13] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2\u20131 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid.[14]\n\n\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[15][16] For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[17] and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1\u20131.[18] Italy won the replay 2\u20130.[19] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.[20]\n\n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3\u20130 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd M\u00fcller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[21] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.[22][23]\n\n\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoene\u00df missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Anton\u00edn Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[24] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5\u20133 on penalties.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 8 teams[edit]\n\n\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[26] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2\u20131, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[27] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before Ren\u00e9 Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[28]\n\n\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2\u20130.[29][30] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruud Gullit and the Netherlands team celebrating their victory in 1988\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2\u20131 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[32][33] The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2\u20130 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[34] Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.[35]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2\u20130.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2\u20131 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2\u20131 after extra time, having come from being 1\u20130 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The UEFA Euro 2004 opening ceremony in Portugal.\nUEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1\u20130 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150\u20131 to win before it began[46] (being the second least likely team to have any success after Latvia)[*citation needed*]. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[47] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[48][49] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.\n\n\nThe 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[50] It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June.[51] The Final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna.[52] Spain defeated Germany 1\u20130, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[53] This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[54] Spain defeated Italy 4\u20130 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[55] In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario G\u00f3mez, Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity\",[56] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 24 teams[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7\u20136 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1\u20130 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[62] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales,[63] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[64] In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and Final being played in London.[65][66] The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[67] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[68] On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[69] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[70][71] In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3\u20132 on penalties, after the game was tied 1\u20131 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.[72]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The trophy on display in 2021\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy.[73] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words *Coupe d'Europe* (\"European Cup\"), *Coupe Henri Delaunay* (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and *Championnat d'Europe* (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs' Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8 kilograms (18\u00a0lb) and is 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4\u00a0lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1\u00a0in) longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy,[74] under the word *Coupe Henri Delaunay* and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning country, West Germany, is written as just *Germany*.[*citation needed*] Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[75] and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[76] However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[77] Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n### The competition[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[78] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[79]\n\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Year\n | Host\n | Teams\n | Matches\n | Round 1\n | Final stages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1960 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 4\n | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches (not counting replays)\n |\n| 2\n | 1964 | ![](image)\u00a0Spain |\n| 3\n | 1968 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 5\n |\n| 4\n | 1972 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches\n |\n| 5\n | 1976 | ![](image)\u00a0Yugoslavia |\n| 6\n | 1980 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 8\n | 14\n | 2 groups of 4 teams: 12 matches\n | final (round 1 group winners) and third-place match (round 1 group runners-up)\n |\n| 7\n | 1984 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 15\n | knockout of 4 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 3 matches\n |\n| 8\n | 1988 | ![](image)\u00a0West Germany |\n| 9\n | 1992 | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden |\n| 10\n | 1996 | ![](image)\u00a0England | 16\n | 31\n | 4 groups of 4 teams: 24 matches\n | knockout of 8 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 7 matches\n |\n| 11\n | 2000 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium![](image)\u00a0Netherlands |\n| 12\n | 2004 | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal |\n| 13\n | 2008 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland![](image)\u00a0Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image)\u00a0Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image)\u00a0Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image)\u00a0England![](image)\u00a0Northern Ireland![](image)\u00a0Republic of Ireland![](image)\u00a0Scotland![](image)\u00a0Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image)\u00a0Italy![](image)\u00a0Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan\u2013European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship qualifying\n\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n5. Results of all group matches:\n\t1. Superior goal difference\n\t2. Higher number of goals scored\n\t3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\n\t4. Fair play conduct.\n6. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Final tournament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.[77]\n\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Host\n |  | Final\n |  | Third place playoff\n |  | Number of teams\n |\n| Winners\n | Score and venue\n | Runners-up\n | Third place\n | Score and venue\n | Fourth place\n |\n| 1960 | ![](image)\u00a0France | **![](image)Soviet Union** | **2\u20131** (a.e.t.)Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 2\u20130 Stade V\u00e9lodrome, Marseille | ![](image)France | 4\n |\n| 1964 | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | **![](image)Spain** | **2\u20131**Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Madrid | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Hungary | 3\u20131 (a.e.t.)Camp Nou, Barcelona | ![](image)Denmark | 4\n |\n| 1968 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | **![](image)Italy** | **1\u20131** (a.e.t.)**2\u20130** (replay)Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)England | 2\u20130 Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Soviet Union | 4\n |\n| 1972 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | **![](image)West Germany** | **3\u20130**Heysel Stadium, Brussels | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Belgium | 2\u20131Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Li\u00e8ge | ![](image)Hungary | 4\n |\n| 1976 | ![](image)\u00a0Yugoslavia | **![](image)Czechoslovakia** | **2\u20132** (a.e.t.)(5\u20133 p)Red Star Stadium, Belgrade | ![](image)West Germany | ![](image)Netherlands | 3\u20132 (a.e.t.)Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | ![](image)Yugoslavia | 4\n |\n| 1980 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | **![](image)West Germany** | **2\u20131**Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Belgium | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 1\u20131 [a](9\u20138 p)Stadio San Paolo, Naples | ![](image)Italy | 8\n |\n| Losing semi-finalists[b] |\n| 1984 | ![](image)\u00a0France | **![](image)France** | **2\u20130**Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Spain | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark and ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 8\n |\n| 1988 | ![](image)\u00a0West Germany | **![](image)Netherlands** | **2\u20130**Olympiastadion, Munich | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)\u00a0Italy and ![](image)\u00a0West Germany | 8\n |\n| 1992 | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2\u20130**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands and ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image)\u00a0England | **![](image)Germany** | **2\u20131** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image)\u00a0England and ![](image)\u00a0France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2\u20131** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands and ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1\u20130**Est\u00e1dio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic and ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1\u20130**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image)\u00a0Russia and ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland![](image)\u00a0Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4\u20130**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image)\u00a0Germany and ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2016 | ![](image)\u00a0France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1\u20130** (a.e.t.)

It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the sport's European governing body, and takes place every four years. The winners of the first final were the Soviet Union, who defeated Yugoslavia 2\u20131 in Paris, after extra time. The most recent final, hosted in London in 2021, was won by Italy, who beat England 3\u20132 on penalties.\n\n\nThe European Championship final is the last match of the competition, and the result determines which country's team is declared European champion. As of the 2020 tournament, if after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.[1] The 16 finals to-date have produced seven drawn matches, the eventual winners of which have been determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976, 2020) or golden goal (1996, 2000).[2] The winners are awarded a replica of the trophy (the original remains with UEFA), while the losing finalists and semi-finalists are presented with a plaque.[3] Gold and silver medals are awarded to the players of the winning and losing finalists respectively.[4]\n\n\nGermany and Spain are the most successful teams in the history of the tournament, winning three times each. Italy and France have each won the competition twice (the only other teams to have won the competition more than once), while Yugoslavia qualified for the final twice without success. Greece, Netherlands and Denmark each won the European Championship on their only appearances in the final, the latter having replaced Yugoslavia on the eve of the 1992 tournament.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe first final of the UEFA European Football Championship (then referred to as the European Nations' Cup Final) was contested in July 1960 in Paris between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Milan Gali\u0107 scored for Yugoslavia just before half-time but Slava Metreveli equalised soon after the break, and the scores remained level, sending the game into extra time. With seven minutes left, Viktor Ponedelnik won the match for the Soviet Union, scoring the winner with a header.[6] The 1960 champions qualified for the final of the 1964 tournament, where they faced hosts Spain. Chus Pereda scored early for the home side, but the match was levelled two minutes later when Galimzyan Khusainov equalised. Nearly 80,000 spectators at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid had to wait for the winner which came six minutes from time, courtesy of a header from Spaniard Marcelino.[7]\n\n\nThe hosts, Italy, faced Yugoslavia in the final of the 1968 tournament, now rebranded as the European Football Championship. Italy had qualified for the final by virtue of winning a coin toss following their goalless semi-final against the Soviet Union. The final ended 1\u20131, forcing a replay to be conducted two days later. This time Italy triumphed, winning 2\u20130 with first-half goals from Gigi Riva and Pietro Anastasi.[8] Four years later, the final, held in Brussels, produced a record winning margin that would last for 44 years. The Soviet Union, finalists for the third time in four tournaments, were defeated 3\u20130 by West Germany with Gerd M\u00fcller and Herbert Wimmer scoring the winning goals.[9] The incumbent champions qualified for the final of the 1976 tournament, where they faced Czechoslovakia. A late equaliser from German Bernd H\u00f6lzenbein to make it 2\u20132 saw the game go into extra time and eventually to a penalty shoot-out. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoene\u00df missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Anton\u00edn Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[10] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5\u20133 on penalties.[11]\n\n\nFour years later, the final returned to the Stadio Olimpico where West Germany, in their third consecutive final, faced Belgium. Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before Ren\u00e9 Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed West Germany into the lead from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner, securing his country's second victory in the championship.[12] The 1984 final, in Paris, featured hosts France against 1964 champions Spain. Two second-half goals, one each from Michel Platini and Bruno Bellone, secured a home victory;[13] Platini ended the tournament with nine goals, the most scored in the championship finals by any player to date.[14] The Netherlands qualified for their first final in the 1988 tournament in West Germany, where they faced the Soviet Union who were playing in their fourth final. Ruud Gullit scored in the first half and Marco van Basten doubled the lead in the second for the Netherlands with a volley which has since been described variously as \"stunning\",[15] \"spectacular\",[16] and the \"best goal scored in the competition's history\".[17] With a 2\u20130 victory, the Netherlands secured their first \"major\" title.[18]\n\n\nFollowing Yugoslavia's expulsion from the competition in 1992, Denmark were invited to take their place and qualified for the final where they faced a team from the newly reunified Germany. Goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort secured a 2\u20130 victory for the Danes in their first and only European final.[19] Wembley Stadium hosted the final of the 1996 tournament, where the Czech Republic and Germany were forced into extra time after an Oliver Bierhoff goal equalised Patrik Berger's penalty for the Czech Republic. Five minutes into extra time, Bierhoff scored his and Germany's second, and the first golden goal in the history of the tournament, securing Germany's third European title 2\u20131.[20] The 2000 tournament was also decided by a golden goal. France, who had won the 1998 FIFA World Cup,[21] met Italy in the Feijnoord Stadion in the Netherlands, both nations making their second appearance in the final. A second-half goal from Marco Delvecchio saw Italy take a 1\u20130 lead into injury time, when Sylvain Wiltord scored a \"last-gasp\" equaliser to send the match into extra time. David Trezeguet's volley 13 minutes into extra time ensured that France were both European and World champions.[22]\n\n\nThe 2004 competition saw, according to UEFA, \"one of the biggest shocks in tournament history\" as Greece defeated hosts Portugal 1\u20130 in the final.[23] Despite never having won a match in a \"major tournament\", a second-half goal from striker Angelos Charisteas caused \"one of the biggest upsets in soccer history\".[24] Germany qualified for their sixth final in 2008, and faced Spain in a tournament co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland. A first-half strike from Fernando Torres was the only goal of the game, and helped Spain win their first European trophy in 44 years.[25] The 2012 tournament final saw reigning European and World champions Spain face Italy in Kyiv. Two first-half goals, one each from David Silva and Jordi Alba put the defending champions 2\u20130 ahead at half-time. Fifteen minutes into the second half, and four minutes after being brought on as a substitute, Thiago Motta was stretchered off as Italy were reduced to ten men for the remainder of the second half. Fernando Torres scored a third, becoming the first player to score in two European Championship finals, and then provided an assist for Juan Mata who scored with a minute to go, the final ending 4\u20130. Spain's third victory in the final equalled Germany as the most successful team in the tournament's history, and they became the first team to defend the European Football Championship title.[26] Portugal became the 10th different team to win the European Championships in 2016, when they beat France 1\u20130 in the final at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis; the match went goalless after 90 minutes, before Eder scored the winning goal four minutes into the second period.[27]\n\n\nIn UEFA Euro 2020, which was actually held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, Italy won their second title after beating first-time finalists England on penalties.\n\n\n\n## List of finals[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey to the list\n| a.e.t.\n | Result after extra time |\n| g.g.\n | Match was won with a golden goal during extra time\n |\n| pen.\n | Match was won on a penalty shoot-out |\n| re.\n | Match was won after a replay |\n\n\n\n\nList of finals of the European Championship\n| Tournament\n | Winners\n | Score\n | Runners-up\n | Venue\n | Location\n | Attendance\n | References\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1960 | Soviet Union\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20131 (a.e.t.)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Yugoslavia | Parc des Princes | Paris, France | 17,966\n | [28][29] |\n| 1964 | Spain\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union | Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium | Madrid, Spain | 79,115\n | [30][31] |\n| 1968 | Italy\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20131 (a.e.t.)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Yugoslavia | Stadio Olimpico | Rome, Italy | 68,817\n | [32][33] |\n| 2\u20130 (re.)\n | 32,886\n |\n| 1972 | West Germany\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union | Heysel Stadium | Brussels, Belgium | 43,066\n | [34][35] |\n| 1976 | Czechoslovakia\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20132 (a.e.t.)

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. In 2019 the number of people with a foreign background was 26%;[9] this category includes foreigners, naturalized citizens, ethnic German repatriates from Eastern Europe and the children of all of the above.\n\n\nUntil the early 20th century Germany was also a large emigrant nation; in the 19th century more than 5 million citizens of the German Empire emigrated to the US alone, and in the early 20th century Germany lost another two million to the US as well as significant numbers to Latin America, Canada and Eastern Europe. However, after World War II immigration began to outweigh emigration, as around 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the former eastern provinces of the Reich and other areas in Eastern Europe. Of these, roughly 12 million made their way to present-day Germany and several hundred thousand settled in Austria and other countries, while several hundred thousand died. Some additional 4.5 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe repatriated after 1950, especially around the end of the Eastern Bloc and mostly from the former Soviet Union, Poland and Romania.[10][11]\n\n\nLarge-scale immigration to West Germany began during the time of the Wirtschaftswunder from the 1950s to early 1970s when Germany had a shortage of workers and let in Southern Europeans from countries like Turkey, Italy and Spain on a temporary basis as guest workers. The liberalisation of guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and build a life in West Germany. Germany saw another large wave of immigration towards the end of the 20th century, driven by German reunification, refugee inflows from the Yugoslav Wars and large numbers of Turkish nationals seeking asylum. The next large immigration wave began after eastern expansion of the European Union in 2011 as Eastern Europeans were now allowed to live and work in Germany without a visa. During the European migrant crisis of the mid 2010s Germany took in a large number of refugees, both in absolute terms and relative to other EU member states; the country recorded 476,649 asylum seekers in 2015, 745,545 in 2016 and declining numbers thereafter.[12]\n\n\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita income of about \u20ac40,883 in 2018,[13] Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. In 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls; but by 2007 this had increased to one child in six. These children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.[14] Millions of Germans travel overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Germany's aging population and struggling economy strained the welfare system in the 1990s, so the government adopted a wide-ranging programme of \u2013 still controversial \u2013 belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour-market reforms known as Hartz concept.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1945\u20131990[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population evolution of Germany, since 1950\nAfter the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern *New L\u00e4nder* to the western *Old L\u00e4nder* for economic reasons.\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic[15] while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\n\n\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.[16]\n\n\n\nMother's mean age at first birth in East and West Germany\n\nNote: Berlin is included into East Germany for the year 2002 and 2008.

This has been attributed to a \"demographic shock\": people not only had fewer children, they were also less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR; the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.[16]\n\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East started to rise again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, and reaching the West's TFR (1.37) in 2007. In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR had risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990,[20][21] which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR was 1.64 in the East and 1.60 in the West.[22]\n\n\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because there were fewer children.[18]\n\n\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%.[18] In 2004, in the age group 18\u201329 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (the East, including Berlin).\n\n\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the *Erziehungsgeld*) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called *Elterngeld* was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\"; the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the *Elterngeld*, and now received lower child benefits than the middle classes.[23] The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.[24]\n\n\nIn 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:[25]\n\n\n\n* The income of families with young children has risen. Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit.\n* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off work (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.\n* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to be.\n* The birth rate of college-educated women has risen.\n\n\nIn the new federal states the fertility rate of college-educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as possible reasons.[26]\n\n\nIn 2019, the non-profit Austrian Institute of Economic Research and the Bertelsmann Stiftung published a study about the economic impact of demographics. The researchers assume a reduction in the per capita income of \u20ac3,700 until 2040.[27]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Census in Germany\n\n![](image)Historical population of Germany\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany used to also be measured by a series of full censuses mandated by the state, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a *micro census*.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28] Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.[29]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 43 seconds\n* One death every 34 seconds\n* Net gain of one person every 4 minutes\n* One net migrant every 2 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

marriage. Out of 778,080 births in 2019, 258,835 were to unmarried parents,[47] which means that around 33% or one third of the children are born out of wedlock, while two thirds are within. This percentage of unmarried birth has long been growing and reached 33% in 2010, more than twice of what it was in 1990.[48] However in recent years it has started to stagnate or even decrease.[49]\n\n\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.[50]\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\n\n\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \"educated mother scheme\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays,[*when?*] 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Western German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 or more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 22 | 30 | 31\n |\n| two children | 39 | 48 | 48\n |\n| three or more children | 39 | 22 | 21\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Eastern German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 and more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 23 | 33 | 33\n |\n| two children | 37 | 46 | 51\n |\n| three or more children | 40 | 21 | 16\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nIn 2011, this trend was reversed in Eastern Germany, where more highly educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate than the rest of the population.[52]\n\n\nPersons who said they had no religion tend to have fewer children than those who identify as Christians, and studies also found that conservative-leaning Christians had more children compared to liberal-leaning Christians.[53][54]\n\n\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.[55]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Homelessness in Germany.[edit]\nHomelessness in Germany is a significant social issue, one that is estimated to affect around 678,000 people.[56] This figure includes about 372,000 people that are accommodated (in refugee shelters, etc.) by public services, e.g. by the municipalities.[57] Since 2014, there has been a 150% increase in the homeless population within the country.[58] Reportedly, around 22,000 of the homeless population are children.[56][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nIn addition, the country has yet to publish statistics on homelessness at a Federal Level[59] despite it being an ongoing and widespread matter.\n\n## Ethnic minorities and migrant background (*Migrationshintergrund*)[edit]\n\n\nGermany does not collect data on the ethnic and racial identifications of its citizens, but does collect data on the background group by birth of an individual.[60] The Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005\u00a0\u2013 the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background\u00a0\u2013 the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.[61] In 2019, 40% children under 5 years old had migrant background.[62]\n\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new L\u00e4nder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.[61] Eastern Germany has a much lower proportion of immigrants than the West, as the GDR did not let in that many guest workers and Eastern Germany's economy is not doing as well as West Germany's and had a higher percentage of jobless persons until recently. However in recent years the number of people with an immigrant background in East Germany has been growing as refugees (as well as German Repatriates) are distributed with the K\u00f6nigssteiner Schl\u00fcssel, so every German state has to take the same number of them compared to its population and economy. In 2019 19.036 million people or 89,6% of people with an immigrant background live in Western Germany (excluding Berlin), being 28,7% of its population, while 1.016 million people with immigrant background 4,8% live in Eastern States, being 8,2% of population, and 1.194 million people with an immigrant background 5,6% live in Berlin, being 33,1% of its population.[62]\n\n\nIn 2019, 26% of Germans of any age group (up from 18,4% in 2008) and 39% of German children (up from 30% in 2008) had at least one parent born abroad. Average age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 35.6 years (up from 33.8 years in 2008), while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 47.3 years (up from 44.6 in 2008).[62][63]\n\n\nIn 2022, 41 percent of the under-15 age group had a migrant background, 36 percent of the 15 to 49-year-old age group had a migrant background and 19 percent of the age group above (50+).[64]\n\n\nThe largest groups of people with an immigrant background in Germany are people that have Turkey, Poland and Russia as their ancestral homelands.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the population by background was as follows:\n\n\n\n![](image)Major groups which reside in Germany by ancestry as of 2019\n**Population of Germany in 2022**\n\n\n\nGermans[65] (71.3%)\nTurkish

groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" (*nationale Minderheiten*) because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\n\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I.[70] Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Pia\u015bnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann G\u00f6ring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles. The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force. With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival. In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries. Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\n\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, and are classified as immigrants or refugees.\n\n\n\n![](image)A family of so-called \"Sp\u00e4taussiedler\" (repatriates of ethnic German origin), because the parents were born abroad they will be counted as \"persons with immigrant background\"\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these *Heimatvertriebene* in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered those with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews, and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% are of German descent.[71][72]\n\n\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991.[73] Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage. Today, less than 0.1% of the total population of Germany is Jewish.\n\n\n  \n\nIn 2019 there were also a growing number of at least 529,000 black Afro-Germans defined as people with an African migrant background.[62] Out of them more than 400 thousand have a citizenship of a Subsahara-African country,[74] with others being German citizens. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from northern African Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \"Afro-Germans,\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\n\n\nGermany's biggest East Asian minorities are the Chinese people in Germany, numbering 189,000[62]\nand Vietnamese people in Germany, numbering 188,000,[62] many of whom living in Berlin and eastern Germany.\nAlso there are about 35,000 Japanese citizens residing in Germany.[75] There are also groups of South Asian and Southeast Asian immigrants. Around 163,000 Indians and 124,000 Pakistanis live in Germany.[62] Additionally some 30,000 Filipino citizens and more than 20,000 Indonesian citizens reside in Germany.[75]\n\n\nNumerous descendants of the so-called *Gastarbeiter* live in Germany. The *Gastarbeiter* mostly came from Turkey, Italy, Greece, Spain, Morocco, Portugal, the former Yugoslavia, Tunisia and Chile.\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990.[76] The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.[77] Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation.[78] This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\n\n\n\n![](image)Proportion of Germans without a migrant background (2016)\n![](image)Germany is home to the second-largest number of international migrants worldwide.[79][80] In 2016, around 23% of Germany's population do not hold a German passport or are descendants of immigrants.[81]\n## Foreign nationals in Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)German and foreign national population pyramid of Germany in 2021\nAs the end of 2022, the most common groups of resident foreign nationals in Germany were as follows:[82]\n\n\nThis list does not include non-ethnic Germans with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Nationality\n | Population (31.12.2022)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Total | 13,383,910\n |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 1,487,110\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine | 1,164,200\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Syria | 923,805\n |\n| 4 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Romania | 883,670\n |\n| 5 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Poland | 880,780\n |\n| 6 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Italy | 644,970\n |\n| 7 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Croatia | 436,325\n |\n| 8 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Bulgaria | 429,665\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan | 377,240\n |\n| 10 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Greece | 361,270\n |\n| 11 | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 290,615\n |\n| 12 | ![](image)\u00a0Iraq | 284,595\n |\n| 13 | ![](image)\u00a0Kosovo | 280,850\n |\n| 14 | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 251,365\n |\n| 15 | ![](image)\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina | 233,775\n |\n| 16 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Hungary | 214,695\n |\n| 17 | ![](image)\u00a0India | 210,385\n |\n| 18 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Spain | 193,460\n |\n| 19 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Austria | 185,755\n |\n| 20 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 150,295\n |\n| 21 | ![](image)\u00a0China | 149,550\n |\n| 22 | ![](image)\u00a0North Macedonia | 146,380\n |\n| 23 | ![](image)\u00a0Iran | 143,555\n |\n| 24 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0France | 140,320\n |\n| 25 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 139,435\n |\n| 26 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 121,420\n |\n| 27 | ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | 120,535\n |\n| 28 | ![](image)\u00a0Albania | 108,555\n |\n| 29 | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | 95,095\n |\n| 30 | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 84,605\n |\n\n\n## Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density by municipality\nWith an estimated 83.2 million inhabitants in December 2020,[83] Germany is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and ranks as the 19th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 233 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\n\n\n### States[edit]\n\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as *L\u00e4nder*.[84] Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (*Stadtstaaten*) and states with larger territories (*Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder*). For regional administrative purposes four states, namely Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, consist of a total of 19 Government Districts (*Regierungsbezirke*). As of 2019 Germany is divided into 400 districts (*Kreise*) on municipal level, these consist of 294 rural districts and 106 urban districts.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![Lower Saxony](image)\u00a0Lower Saxony\n\n![Free Hanseatic City of Bremen](image)\u00a0Bremen\n\n![Hamburg](image)\u00a0Hamburg\n\n![Mecklenburg-Vorpommern](image)\u00a0Mecklenburg-  \nVorpommern\n\n![Saxony-Anhalt](image)\u00a0Saxony-  \nAnhalt\n\n![Saxony](image)\u00a0Saxony\n\n![Brandenburg](image)\u00a0Brandenburg\n\n![Berlin](image)\u00a0Berlin\n\n![Thuringia](image)\u00a0Thuringia\n\n![Hesse](image)\u00a0Hesse\n\n![North Rhine-Westphalia](image)\u00a0North\u00a0Rhine-  \nWestphalia\n\n![Rhineland-Palatinate](image)\u00a0Rhineland-Palatinate\n\n![Bavaria](image)\u00a0Bavaria\n\n![Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg](image)\u00a0Baden-  \nW\u00fcrttemberg\n\n![Saarland](image)\u00a0Saarland\n\n![Schleswig-Holstein](image)\u00a0Schleswig-Holstein\n\n![](image)Germany states by foreigners as percentage of population as of November 2020\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| State | Capital | Area(km2) | Population[85](31 December 2022)\n | Foreigners\n | Population density(per km2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | D\u00fcsseldorf | 34,112 | 18,139,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,828,367 ![Increase](image) | 532\n |\n| Bavaria | Munich | 70,541 | 13,369,116 ![Increase](image) | 2,073,494 ![Increase](image) | 190\n |\n| Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg | Stuttgart | 35,748 | 11,280,257 ![Increase](image) | 2,012,237 ![Increase](image) | 316\n |\n| Lower Saxony | Hanover | 47,709 | 8,140,242 ![Increase](image) | 959,786 ![Increase](image) | 171\n |\n| Hesse | Wiesbaden | 21,116 | 6,391,360 ![Increase](image) | 1,199,775 ![Increase](image) | 303\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | Mainz | 19,858 | 4,159,150 ![Increase](image) | 566,026 ![Increase](image) | 209\n |\n| Saxony | Dresden | 18,450 | 4,086,152 ![Increase](image) | 300,164 ![Increase](image) | 221\n |\n| Berlin | Berlin | 891 | 3,755,251 ![Increase](image) | 834,349 ![Increase](image) | 4,215\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | Kiel | 15,804 | 2,953,270 ![Increase](image) | 299,787 ![Increase](image) | 187\n |\n| Brandenburg | Potsdam | 29,654 | 2,573,135 ![Increase](image) | 179,872 ![Increase](image) | 87\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | Magdeburg | 20,454 | 2,186,643 ![Increase](image) | 160,990 ![Increase](image) | 107\n |\n| Thuringia | Erfurt | 16,202 | 2,126,846 ![Increase](image) | 161,291 ![Increase](image) | 131\n |\n| Hamburg | Hamburg | 755 | 1,892,122 ![Increase](image) | 363,283 ![Increase](image) | 2,506\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | Schwerin | 23,295 | 1,628,378 ![Increase](image) | 105,437 ![Increase](image) | 70\n |\n| Saarland | Saarbr\u00fccken | 2,571 | 992,666 ![Increase](image) | 139,189 ![Increase](image) | 386\n |\n| Bremen | Bremen | 419 | 684,864 ![Increase](image) | 144,148 ![Increase](image) | 1,634\n |\n| Germany | Berlin | 357,582 | 84,358,845 ![Increase](image) | 12,324,195 ![Increase](image) | 236\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of cities in Germany; List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants; and Metropolitan regions in Germany\n\nGermany officially has eleven metropolitan regions. In 2005, Germany had 82 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Metropolitan region | Location | Description | Population | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rhine-Ruhr | ![](image) | The metropolitan area is part of the pan-European Blue Banana mega region and is a significant industrial and commercial hub, home to many of Germany's biggest corporations and contributing as much as 15% to the German GDP. Included in the rather polycentric conurbation are the cities of Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, Bonn, Dortmund and Essen served by two of the country's largest airports D\u00fcsseldorf Airport and the Cologne Bonn Airport. Particularly among young Germans, Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf are known for their nightlife and open-minded atmosphere.\n | approx. 10 million\n | Turks, Poles, Italians, Romanians, Africans, Arabs, Greeks, Dutch, Russians, Serbs, Bulgarians and Spaniards |\n| Berlin/Brandenburg | ![](image) | Berlin is the capital and largest city. It lies in the eastern part of the country, completely surrounded by the rather sparsely populated state of Brandenburg. Berlin is regarded as one of Europe's most open, vibrant and ever changing capitals. The city is arguably the most diverse city in Germany regarding culture and ethnicity. Regarded as an economically weak region of Germany for a long time, it is now transforming itself into the entrepreneurial center of Europe. Dubbed the \"Silicon Allee\" by insiders of the tech industry, Berlin is home to countless startup companies and one of Germany's densest knowledge hubs with 4 public universities and countless research centers.\n | approx. 6 million\n | Turks, Russians, Poles, Africans, Italians, Americans, Vietnamese, Serbs, Arabs, Bulgarians, Romanians, French and Spaniards |\n| Munich | ![](image) | The metropolitan area in and around Munich has one of Germany's highest standard of living. Housing some of the countries largest car and machine companies, it is known for its economic strength mixed with the uniqueness of Bavarian culture, taking up almost the entirety of southern Bavaria. It is the closest metropolitan area to the Alps.\n | approx. 5.7 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Croats, Italians, Poles, Greeks, Austrians, Romanians, Arabs, Africans and Serbs |\n| Rhine-Main | ![](image) | Frankfurt is the financial and commercial center both for Germany and continental Europe. Almost all of Germany's big banks and the ECB have their HQ located inside the city of Frankfurt. Despite not having a population of over a million, it is Germany's only city with a large, visible cluster of skyscrapers. The city is one of Europe's biggest transit hubs with Europe's 6th busiest airport (Frankfurt airport), Germany's second busiest railway stations and one of the EU's most heavily used interchanges.\n | approx. 5.5 million\n | Turks, Poles, Italians, African, Croats, Romanians, Greeks, Serbs, Spaniards, Americans, Chinese, Arabs and Indians |\n| Hamburg | ![](image) | Hamburg is the country's second largest city and the biggest Hanseatic city in Europe. It is Europe's 3rd busiest container port with just under 9 million TEUs annually. The city is proud of its diverse nightlife and music scene centered in and around the famous St. Pauli district.\n | approx. 5.3 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Poles, African, Portuguese, Romanians, Russians, Italians and Spaniards |\n| Stuttgart | ![](image) | Stuttgart has a reputation for research, inventions and industry. The German headquarters of many international enterprises are in Stuttgart. This contrasts with the strong rural, down-to-earth attitude of the Stuttgarters throughout the classes. A popular slogan is \"We are good at everything. Except speaking High (standard) German.\"\n | approx. 5.2 million\n | Turks, Albanians, Greeks, Dutch, Italians, Croats, Serbs, French, Chinese, Romanians, Americans and Spaniards.[*citation needed*] |\n| Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg | ![](image) | The relatively urban south of Lower Saxony, located on route between the Ruhr area and Berlin, and the route form Hamburg to the south, has been important for logistics, industry, but also developed a strong standing in the service industries.\n | approx. 3.7 million\n | Turks, Kurds (especially around Celle), Serbs, Ukrainians, Greeks, Russians, Italians (especially in Wolfsburg) and Spanish (Especially in Hanover).[*citation needed*] |\n| Bremen/Oldenburg | ![](image) | Located in the northwestern part of Germany, the main axis contains the cities of Bremen, Delmenhorst and Oldenburg, with the cities of Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven being the northern corners at the north sea. Major rural areas are covered in between these cities. There is a smooth transition to the Hamburg metropolitan area to the east.\n | approx. 2.7 million\n | Turks, Russians, Albanians, Serbs, Portuguese, Iranians, Dutch, Americans and Britons.[*citation needed*] |\n| Central German Metropolitan Region | ![](image) | The economic region stretches across three federal states. The major city is Leipzig in Saxony, other important cities are Halle/Saale, Gera and Jena. The region is known for its universities and research, for its trade fairs and conventions, as a central distribution hub (Leipzig-Halle-Airport), as center for chemical and industrial production, for the well preserved inner cities and the developed classical and alternative cultural scene. Leipzig is one of the fastest-growing cities in Germany, with a rising economy.\n | approx. 2.4 mil\n | Russians, Poles, Vietnamese, Italians, Romanians, Ukrainians, Chinese, Turks, Portuguese, people from Syria, from Kazakhstan and from Afghanistan.[86] |\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Immigration to Germany and Germans Abroad\n See also: European migrant crisis\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund lists Germany as host to the third-highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia.[80] The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the Turkish. Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has attracted immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) have acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, changes to guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and to build lives in Germany.\n\n\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\n\nAs of 2012, after Germany fully legalized visa-free immigrants from the eastern states of the EU, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany were other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumbered new immigrants in 2012,[87] however, in recent years there are more Turkish immigrants in Germany than emigrants again, including illegal Turkish migrants.\n\n\nIn 2015, there was a large increase in asylum applications following the 2015 refugee crisis, mainly due to the violent conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan: 476,649 asylum applications were counted that year.[88] This number went up to even 745,545 in 2016 and began to decline after it.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, some 23.8 million people in Germany, or 28.7% of the population have migrant background.[89]\n\n\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[90]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Germany\n\n![](image)Cadets of the German Navy exercising in front of one of the gyms of Germany's naval officers school, the Marineschule M\u00fcrwik\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a *Gesamtschule* (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called *Duale Ausbildung* (\"dual education\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.[91]\n\n\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years, depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.[91] In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the *Gymnasium* enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the *Realschule* for intermediate students lasts six years; the *Hauptschule* prepares pupils for vocational education.[92]\n\n\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the *Gesamtschule*. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule,[93] while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\n\n\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.[94] Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of \u20ac500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.\n\n\n*Percentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany[95]*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **1970** | **1982** | **1991** | **2000** |\n| **Hauptschulabschluss** | 87,7%\n | 79,3%\n | 66,5%\n | 54,9%\n |\n| **Realschulabschluss** | 10,9%\n | 17,7%\n | 27%\n | 34,1%\n |\n| **Abitur** | 1,4%\n | 3%\n | 6,5%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\nOver 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in cooperation with the \"Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.\", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts.[96] Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Germany\n\nThe life expectancy in Germany is 81.1 years (78.7 years males, 83.6 years females, 2020 est.).[97] \nAs of 2009[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.[98]\nAs of 2008[update], about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).[99]\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.[99]\nA 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.[100]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Germany\n\n![](image)2020 map of Christian denominations in the states of Germany Roman Catholic majority\n Christian majority, Catholic plurality\n Christian majority, EKD plurality\n Christians less than 50% of population, majority of Christians belong to EKD\n\nThe national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).[101]\n\n\nAccording to a 1990s poll by *Der Spiegel*, 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ.[102] According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", 25% responded that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 27% responded that \"they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\". 4% gave no response.[103]\n\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising an estimated 53.9% of the country's population.[104][105]\n\n\nSmaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.[106][104]\n\n\nThe two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents. In 2020 the Catholic Church accounted for 26.7%[104][105][107] and the Evangelical Church for 24.3%[104][105][108] of the population. Orthodox Church has 1.9% and other Christian churches and groups summed up to 1.1% of the population.[104][106] Since the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 40.7% of the country's population are not affiliated with any church or religion.[104][105][106]\n\n\nThe other religions make up to less than 1% of the population.[106] Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000\u201360,000).[109] All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 (<0.1%) adherents.\n\n\n\n| Religion in Germany (2020)[104][105] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| No Religion |  | 40.7% |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 26.7% |\n| Protestant Church |  | 24.3% |\n| Islam |  | 3.5% |\n| Orthodox Church |  | 1.9% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.1% |\n| Other Religions |  | 0.9% |\n\nProtestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west. According to the last nationwide census, Protestantism is more widespread among the population with German citizenship; there are slightly more Catholics total because of the Catholic immigrant population (including such groups as Poles and Italians).[110] The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics, might make up as many as 55% of the total population, and are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.[111]\n\n\nOf the roughly 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites and other denominations.[112][113] 1.9% of the country's overall population declare themselves Orthodox Christians,[104] with Serbs, Greeks, Romanians, Ukrainians and Russians being the most numerous.[114] Germany has Europe's third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom).[115] In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.[116] Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.[117]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Census[edit]\n\n\n**Religion (2011 German Census)**\n\n\n\nCatholic Church (30.8%)\nEKD (30.3%)\nOther, atheist or unspecified[118] (38.9%)\n\nCensus results were as follows:\n\n\n\n* Roman Catholic Church: 24,740,380 or 30.8% of the German population;\n* Protestant Church: 24,328,100 or 30.3% of the German population;\n* Other, atheist or not specified (including Protestants outside EKD): 31,151,210 or 38.9% of the German population.[110]\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Germany\n\nGerman is the only official and most widely spoken language. Standard German is understood throughout the country.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Federal Statistical Office of Germany included a new question regarding the language spoken at home in the micro-census, a large sample survey that yearly covers approximately 1% of the German population living in private households, and the results were as follows:[119]\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages spoken at home, 2022 micro census\n| Language\n | Absolute number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 83,103,000\n | 100.00\n |\n| Only German\n | 65,440,000\n | 78.75\n |\n| Mostly German\n | 4,125,000\n | 4.96\n |\n| Mostly another language\n | 13,538,000\n | 16.29\n |\n| Of which\n | Albanian | 509,000\n | 0.61\n |\n|  | Arabic | 1,348,000\n | 1.62\n |\n| Bosnian | 237,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Bulgarian | 218,000\n | 0.26\n |\n| Chinese | 145,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Danish | 15,000\n | 0.02\n |\n| English | 861,000\n | 1.04\n |\n| French | 190,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Greek | 286,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Italian | 496,000\n | 0.60\n |\n| Croatian | 384,000\n | 0.46\n |\n| Kurdish | 511,000\n | 0.61\n |\n| Macedonian | 87,000\n | 0.10\n |\n| Dutch | 97,000\n | 0.12\n |\n| Pahto | 36,000\n | 0.04\n |\n| Persian | 391,000\n | 0.47\n |\n| Polish | 937,000\n | 1.13\n |\n| Portuguese | 167,000\n | 0.20\n |\n| Romanian | 670,000\n | 0.81\n |\n| Russian | 1,639,000\n | 1.97\n |\n| Serbian | 252,000\n | 0.30\n |\n| Spanish | 284,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Turkish | 1,879,000\n | 2.26\n |\n| Hungarian | 203,000\n | 0.24\n |\n| Ukrainian | 191,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Vietnamese | 138,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Another European\nlanguage\n | 277,000\n | 0.33\n |\n| Another African\nlanguage\n | 243,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Another Asian\nlanguage\n | 514,000\n | 0.62\n |\n|  | Another language\n | 333,000\n | 0.4\n |\n\n\n### Minority languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bilingual German-Sorbian city limit signs\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\n\n\nGermany is a strong supporter of the Charter, as evidenced by things like the 2022 report from the Secretary General of the Council of Europe specifically naming Germany as an example of how to incorporate minority languages in State media.[120][121] Still, Germany\u2014like many other signatories of the Charter\u2014has room for improvement in its implementation of the Charter.[122]\n\n\n\n\n\nProtected Minority Languages in Germany\n| Language | States\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Danish | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| North Frisian | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| Saterland Frisian | Lower Saxony |\n| Low German | Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Low Rhenish | North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Upper Sorbian | Saxony |\n| Lower Sorbian | Brandenburg |\n| Romany | Hesse *de facto*, *de jure* in all states (see text)\n |\n\n\n### High German dialects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City limits sign; this city is called *Emlichheim* in High German and *Emmelkamp* in Low German.\nGerman dialects \u2013 some quite distinct from the standard language \u2013 are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes.[*citation needed*] Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Low Saxon dialects[edit]\n\n\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\n\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north\u2013south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Foreign languages[edit]\n\n\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland.[123]Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English.[*citation needed*] About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans as compulsory first foreign language.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![flag](image)European Union portal\n\n\n* Germans\n* Census in Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and have been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and a reducing population.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Bev\u00f6lkerungsstand\".

As of January 2020, there were 47,431,256 people living in Spain.[2] Its population density, at 91.4 inhabitants per square kilometre (237/sq\u00a0mi), is lower than other Western European countries yet, with the exception of microstates, it has the highest real density population in Europe, based on density of inhabited areas.[3] With the exception of the capital Madrid, the most densely populated areas lie around the coast.\n\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural interior to the industrial cities. Eleven of Spain's fifty provinces saw an absolute decline in population over the century.\n\n\nThe last quarter of the century saw a dramatic fall in birth rates. Spain's fertility rate of 1.47 (the number of children the average woman will have during her lifetime) has climbed every year since the late 1990s. The birth rate has climbed in 10 years from 9.10 births per 1000 people per year in 1996 to 10.9 in 2006, before declining again to 7.13 by 2021.\n\n\nIn 2021 the Total Fertility Rate of Spain (average number of children per woman) was 1.19, and 3.7% was the percent of births to women that were their 4th+ child.\n\n\nSpain accepted 478,990 new immigrant residents in the first six months of 2022 alone. During these first six months, 220,443 people also emigrated from Spain, leaving a record-breaking net migration figure of 258,547.[4] The data shows that more women than men chose to move to Spain during 2022, this is due to higher rates of emigration from Latin America.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNotable events in modern Spanish demography:\n\n\n\n* 1808-1814. Peninsular War and Spanish War of Independence: 0.24-0.4-1.0 million deaths.\n* Late 19th century and early 20th century: Relative economic stagnation and mass emigration to American countries.\n* 1918. Flu pandemic, over 200,000 dead in Spain.\n* 1936. Start of the Spanish Civil War.\n* 1939. End of the Civil War. Establishment of a dictatorship, Start of rationing policies. Deepening of economic depression, mass emigration to European and American countries due to economic and political motives (Republican exile).\n* 1941. Approval of benefits for large families, with at least four children.[5]\n* 1945. Establishment of tax deductions for parents.[6]\n* 1952. End of rationing policies.\n* 1975. End of the dictatorship, mass return of emigrated people.\n* 1977. Legalization of contraception. Decline of birth rates.\n* 1985. Legalization of abortion.\n* 1988. After centuries of outwards emigration, the first events of illegal immigration from Africa occur.[7]\n* 1991. Spain becomes a net receiver of immigrants, after decades of mass emigration.[8]\n* 1994. Lowering of threshold of requirements to become a large family, only three children needed.[5]\n* 2007. Approval of \u20ac2,500 benefit for births.\n* 2010. Legalization of elective abortion.\n* 2011. Withdrawal of the \u20ac2,500 benefit for births.\n* 2015. First negative natural change since the Civil War due to the aging of Spanish population.\n\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century as a result of the demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s. After that time, the birth rate fell during the 1980s and Spain's population became stalled.\n\n\nMany demographers have linked Spain's very low fertility rate to the country's lack of a family support policy. Spain spends the least on family support out of all western European countries\u20140.5% of GDP. A graphic illustration of the enormous social gulf in this field is the fact[*citation needed*] that a Spanish family would need to have 57 children to enjoy the same financial support as a family with 3 children in Luxembourg[*citation needed*].[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring the early 2000s, the mean year-on-year demographic growth set a new record with its 2003 peak variation of 2.1%, doubling the previous record reached back in the 1960s when a mean year-on-year growth of 1% was experienced.[9] In 2005 alone, the immigrant population of Spain increased by 700,000 people.[10]\n\n\nThe arrival of migrating young adults was the main reason for the slight increase in Spain's fertility rate.[11] From 2002 through 2008 the Spanish population grew by 8%, of which 7% were foreign.[12]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the World Population Review in 2019.[13]\n\n\n\n* One birth every minute\n* One death every minute\n* Net gain of one person every 131 minutes\n* One net migrant every 13 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians,[*failed verification*][26] although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity.\nDefinition of ethnicity or nationality in Spain is fraught politically. The term \"Spanish people\" (*pueblo espa\u00f1ol*) is defined in the 1978 constitution as the political sovereign, i.e. the citizens of the Kingdom of Spain. The same constitution in its preamble speaks of \"peoples and nationalities of Spain\" (*pueblos y nacionalidades de Espa\u00f1a*) and their respective cultures, traditions, languages and institutions.\nThe formerly nomadic Gitanos and Mercheros are distinctly marked by endogamy and discrimination but they are dispersed through the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe native Canarians are partly the descendants of the North African population of the Canary Islands prior to Spanish colonization in the 15th century although many Spaniards have varying levels of North African admixture as a result of the Islamic period. Also included are many Spanish citizens who are descendants of people from Spain's former colonies, mostly from Venezuela, Argentina, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Morocco and Cuba. There is also a sizable number of Spaniards of Eastern European, Maghrebian, Sub Saharan-African, Indian subcontinent and Middle Eastern descent.[27]\n\n\nThe arrival of the *gitanos* (Spanish for \"gypsies\"), a Romani people, began in the 16th century; estimates of the Spanish Roma population range from 750,000 to over one million.[28][29][30][31][32] There are also the *mercheros* (also called *quinquis*), a formerly nomadic minority group. Their origin is unclear.\n\n\nHistorically, Sephardic Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originating in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture.[33] The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to Sephardic Jews.[34]\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Spain\n\nIn terms of emigration vs. immigration, after decades of net emigration after the Spanish Civil War, Spain has experienced massive large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history over the past 30 years. As of 2020, there were 7,231,195 foreign-born people in Spain, making up to 15.23% of the Spanish population including 5,015,263 (10.57%) born in a non-European country.[35] Of these, 5,434,153 (11.45%) didn't have the Spanish citizenship.[36][37] This makes Spain one of the world's preferred destinations to immigrate to, being the 4th country in Europe by immigration numbers and the 10th worldwide. Of these, more than 860,000 were Romanian, and 760,000 were Moroccan while the number of Ecuadorians was around 390,000. Colombian population amounted to around 300,000. There are also a significant number of British (359,076 as of 2011, but more than one million are estimated to live permanently in Spain) and German (195,842) citizens, mainly in Alicante, M\u00e1laga provinces, Balearic Islands and Canary Islands. The largest Asian immigrant group, the Chinese, number slightly over 166,000. Immigrants from several sub-Saharan African countries have also settled in Spain as contract workers, representing 4.08% of all the foreign residents in the country. \n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation by country

Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Spain\n\nReligion in Spain (CIS poll, December 2020) [46]\n\n\n\nNon-practicing Catholic (41.6%)\nPracticing Catholic (20.1%)\nAgnostic/Non-believer (20.8%)\nAtheist (13.6%)\nOther denominations and religions (2.7%)\nDid not answer (1.2%)\n\nThe Reconquista was the long process by which the Catholics reconquered Spain from Islamic rule by 1492. The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 to complete the religious orthodoxy of the Iberian Peninsula. In the centuries that followed, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity; since then, Catholicism has been the main religion in Spain.[47][48]\n\n\nSpanish missionaries carried Catholicism to the Americas and the Philippines, establishing various missions in the newly colonized lands. The missions served as a base for both administering colonies as well as spreading Christianity.[49][50][51]\n\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 abolished Catholicism as the official state religion, but recognizing the role it plays in Spanish society.[52]\nFrom the end of the Francoist dictatorship to the present day, a secularization process has taken place that has meant a progressive decrease in religious practice, in the attendance at the different religious rites (baptisms, communions and Catholic marriages) and in the percentage of Spaniards who identify as Catholic,[53] Consequently, a majority of Spaniards today ignore Catholic doctrines on matters such as pre-marital sex, homosexuality and contraception.[54][55] Despite the drop, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Spain's culture.[53]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], 68.5% of the population define themselves as Catholic, 26.4% as non-believers or atheists, and 2.6% other religions according to the official Spanish Center for Sociological Research.[56] Among believers, 59% assert they almost never go to any religious service, by contrast, 16.3% attend one or more religious service almost every week.[56][57]\n\n\nThere have been three Popes from what is now Spain, all of them from the Crown of Aragon: Calixtus III, Alexander VI and Benedict XIII. Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with Carmelites like Teresa of \u00c1vila, a reformist nun and John of the Cross, a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement. Later, they became Doctors of the Church. The Society of Jesus was co-founded by Ignatius of Loyola, whose Spiritual Exercises and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone. The Society's co-founder, Francis Xavier, was a missionary who reached India and later Japan. In the 1960s, Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacur\u00eda supported the movement of Liberation Theology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012[update], accounting for 3\u20134% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries. More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality.[58] The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus. After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.[*citation needed*]\nJudaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 Jews are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.[59] However the Jewish Encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small: 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour of 200,000, and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less. Other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled.

It is free in public schools and in many private schools, most of which receive government subsidies[*citation needed*]. Following graduation, students attend either a secondary school offering a general high school diploma or a school of professional study in all fields \u2013 law, sciences, humanities, and medicine \u2013 and the technical schools offer programs in engineering and architecture.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Demographics of Spain.\n\n* Health in Spain\n* List of Spaniards\n* Romani people in Spain\n* Ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities\n* Singular population entity\n* Contemporary history of Spain\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n2. **^** The term 'nationality' (Spanish: *nacionalidad*) was chosen carefully in order to avoid the more politically charged term 'nation'.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Encuesta trimestral de coste laboral\". *ine.es*. 18 June 2019.

Those born during the World wars are marked in dark\nDemographic features of the population of Italy include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Italy had an estimated population of 58,9\u00a0million. Its population density, at 197 inhabitants per square kilometre (510/sq\u00a0mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (which contains about a third of the country's population) in northern Italy and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern Italy, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of Basilicata, the Alps and Apennines highlands, and the island of Sardinia.\n\n\nThe population of the country almost doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950\u20131960s. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\nHigh fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Historical overview[edit]\n\n\n### 1861 to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian diaspora\n\n![](image)Map of the Italian diaspora in the world\nFrom its unification in 1861 to the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, Italy has been a country of mass emigration. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of Italian diaspora, approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated each year.[8] As a consequence, large numbers of people with full or significant Italian ancestry are found in Brazil (32\u00a0million Italian Brazilians),[9][10] Argentina (25\u00a0million Italian Argentines),[11] United States (18\u00a0million Italian Americans),[12] France (5\u00a0million Italian French),[13] Venezuela (5\u00a0million Italian Venezuelans),[14] Paraguay (2.5\u00a0million Italian Paraguayans),[15][16][17] Colombia (2\u00a0million Italian Colombians),[18] Uruguay (1.5\u00a0million Italian Uruguayans),[19] Peru (1.5\u00a0million Italian Peruvians),[20] Canada (1.5\u00a0million Italian Canadians),[21] Germany (1.2\u00a0million Italian Germans)[22] and Australia (1\u00a0million Italian Australians).[23] In addition, Italian communities once thrived in the former African colonies of Eritrea (nearly 100,000 at the beginning of World War II),[24] Somalia and Libya (150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting about 18% of the total Libyan population).[25]\n\n\n\n### After World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Istrian Italians leave Pola in 1947 during the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus\nAfter Tito's annexation of Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara following the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, up to 350,000 local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) left communist Yugoslavia (Istrian\u2013Dalmatian exodus).[26][27] Furthermore, all of Libya's Italians were expelled after Muammar Gaddafi's takeover in 1970.[28]\n\n\nAs a result of the profound economic and social changes brought by rapid postwar economic growth, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, by the 1970s emigration had all but stopped and Italy started to have a positive net migration rate.[29] The nation's immigrant population reached 5 million by 2015, making up some 8% of the total population.[30] However, the long-lasting effects of the Eurozone crisis double-dip recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Italy in the 2010s.[31]\n\n\nFrom January 2020 and December 2021 as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant, Italy has registered at least 178,000 excess deaths, a loss of about 1.4 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in births rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates, the overall effect being a record natural population decline of 342,042 units in that year, the largest ever recorded since 1918 (at the time of World War I and Spanish flu pandemic).[32] In 2022, Italy's birth rate declined to its lowest level on record since 1861, with fewer then 400,000 births recorded that year.[33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historic population of Italy\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 21,777,334 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1871  | 26,801,154 | +2.10% |\n| 1881  | 28,459,628 | +0.60% |\n| 1901  | 32,475,253 | +0.66% |\n| 1911  | 34,671,377 | +0.66% |\n| 1921  | 37,973,977 | +0.91% |\n| 1931  | 41,176,671 | +0.81% |\n| 1936  | 42,993,602 | +0.87% |\n| 1951  | 47,515,537 | +0.67% |\n| 1961  | 50,623,569 | +0.64% |\n| 1971  | 54,136,547 | +0.67% |\n| 1981  | 56,556,911 | +0.44% |\n| 1991  | 56,778,031 | +0.04% |\n| 2001  | 56,995,744 | +0.04% |\n| 2011  | 59,433,744 | +0.42% |\n| 2021 (est.)  | 59,257,566 | \u22120.03% |\n| Source: ISTAT[39][40][32] |\n\n\nFurther information: Italians\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[41]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minute 18 seconds\n* One death every 50 seconds\n* Net loss of one person every 3 minutes 6 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 83% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 17% live in the southern half of the peninsula.[72]\n\n\n\nNet migration rate\n\n3.21 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2021 est.)

Languages of Italy, and Historical linguistic minorities of Italy\n\n![](image)Languages spoken in Italy\nItaly's official language is Italian; Ethnologue has estimated that there are about 55 million speakers of Italian in the country and a further 6.7\u00a0million outside of it, primarily in the neighboring countries and in the Italian diaspora worldwide.[88] Italian, adopted by the central state after the unification of Italy, is a language based on the Florentine variety of Tuscan and is somewhat intermediate between the Italo-Dalmatian languages and the Gallo-Romance languages. Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Italian,[89] even though an estimated 90% of Italians speak Italian as their L1 nowadays.[90]\n\n\nItaly is in fact one of the most linguistically diverse countries in Europe,[91] as there are not only varieties of Italian specific to each cultural region, but also distinct regional and minority languages. The establishment of the national education system has led to the emergence of the former and a decrease in the use of the latter. The spread of Italian was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, because of the economic growth and the rise of mass media and television, with the state broadcaster (RAI) setting a colloquial variety of Italian to which the population would be exposed.\n\n\nAs a way to distance itself from the Italianization policies promoted because of nationalism, Italy recognized twelve languages as the Country's \"historical linguistic minorities\",[92] which are promoted alongside Italian in their respective territories. French is co-official in the Aosta Valley as the province's prestige variety, under which the more commonly spoken Franco-Provencal dialects have been historically roofed.[93] German has the same status in the province of South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino, does Ladin.[94] Slovene[95] and Friulian are officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine in Venezia Giulia. In Sardinia, the Sardinian language has been the language traditionally spoken and is often regarded by linguists as constituting its own branch of Romance;[96] in the 1990s, Sardinian has been recognized as \"having equal dignity\" with Italian,[97] the introduction of which to the island officially started under the rule of the House of Savoy in the 18th century.\n\n\nIn these regions, official documents are either bilingual (trilingual in Ladin communities) in the co-official language(s) by default, or available as such upon request. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d'Aosta where French toponyms are generally used, with the exception of Aosta itself, which has retained its Latin form in Italian as well as English. Attempts to Italianize them, especially during the Fascist period, have been formally abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.\n\n\nUNESCO and other authorities recognize a number of other languages which are not legally protected by Italian government: Piedmontese, Venetian, Ligurian, Lombard, Emilian-Romagnolo, Neapolitan and Sicilian.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Italy\n\nReligion in Italy according to the Eurobarometer survey, 2021[98]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (79.2%)\nEastern Orthodoxy (3.5%)\nProtestantism (0.3%)\nOther Christian (1.4%)\nIslam (1.0%)\nBuddhism (0.4%)\nHinduism/Sikhism (0.3%)\nJudaism (0.1%)\nOther (1.4%)\nAgnosticism (7.5%)\nAtheism (4.1%)\nUndeclared (1.0%)\n\nRoman Catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion. In 2006, 87.8% of Italy's population self-identified as Roman Catholic,[99] although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%). In 2016, 71.1% of *Italian citizens* self-identified as Roman Catholic.[100] This increased again to 78% in 2018.[7]\n\n\nMost Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to a Eurobarometer Poll in 2005:[101] 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'. There are no data collected through census.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nThe Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the Pope, curia in Rome, and the Conference of Italian Bishops. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with Latin, Italian is the most spoken and second language of the Roman Curia.[102]\n\n\nItaly has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic saints, martyrs and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Caravaggio, Fra Angelico, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian and Giotto. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as St Peter's Basilica, Florence Cathedral and St Mark's Basilica. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 71.1% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of cardinals in the world,[103] and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence, which has the biggest brick dome in the world,[105][106] and is considered a masterpiece of Italian architecture.\nEven though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of Protestant, Waldensian, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches.\n\n\nImmigration from Western, Central, and Eastern Africa at the beginning of the 21st century has increased the size of Baptist, Anglican, Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy, while immigration from Eastern Europe has produced large Eastern Orthodox communities.\n\n\nIn 2006, Protestants made up 2.1% of Italy's population, and members of Eastern Orthodox churches comprised 1.2% or more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians including 180,000 Greek Orthodox,[107] 550,000 Pentecostals and Evangelists (0.8%), of whom 400,000 are members of the Assemblies of God, about 250,000 are Jehovah's Witnesses (0.4%),[108] 30,000 Waldensians,[109] 25,000 Seventh-day Adventists, 22,000 Mormons, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 Lutherans, 4,000 Methodists (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).[110]\n\n\n\n### Other religions[edit]\n\n\nThe longest-established religious faith in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome before the birth of Christ. Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as prime minister Luigi Luzzatti, who took office in 1910, Ernesto Nathan served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and Shabbethai Donnolo (died 982). During the Holocaust, Italy took in many Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet Italian Social Republic, about 15% of 48,000 Italian Jews were killed. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.\n\n\nDue to immigration from around the world, there has been an increase in non-Christian religions. As of 2009, there were 1.0\u00a0million Muslims in Italy[111] forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8\u00a0million[112] to 1.5\u00a0million.[113] 50,000 Italian Muslims hold Italian citizenship.\n\n\nThere are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country,[114] 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.[115] There were an estimated 4,900 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in Italy in 2005.[116]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n**Literacy**\n\n\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 99.2%\nmale: 99.4%\nfemale: 99% (2018 est.)\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 16 years\nmale: 16 years\nfemale: 17 years (2018)\n## Genetics and ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Italy\n\n![](image)Principal Component Analysis of the Italian population.[117]\nThe genetic history of Italy is greatly influenced by geography and history. The ancestors of Italians are mostly Indo-European speakers (Italic peoples such as Latins,  Umbrians, Samnites, Oscans, Sicels and Adriatic Veneti, as well as Celts, Iapygians and Greeks) and pre-Indo-European speakers (Etruscans, Ligures, Rhaetians and Camunni in mainland Italy, Sicani and Elymians in Sicily and the Nuragic people in Sardinia). During the imperial period of Ancient Rome, the city of Rome was also home to people from various regions throughout the Mediterranean basin, including Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.[118] Based on DNA analysis, there is evidence of ancient regional genetic substructure and continuity within modern Italy dating to the pre-Roman and Roman periods.[119][120][121][122]\n\n\nWithin the Italian population, there is enough cultural, linguistic, genetic and historical diversity for them to constitute several distinct groups throughout the peninsula.[123] In this regard, peoples like the Friulians, the Ladins, the Sardinians and the South Tyroleans, who also happen to constitute recognized linguistic minorities, or even the Sicilians who are not, are cases in point, attesting to such internal diversity.\n\n\nLinguistic minorities in Italy include Sardu-speakers 1 million, Tyrolese German-speakers 350,000, Albanians 70,000 \u2013 100,000, Slovenes 60,000, Franco-Proven\u00e7al-speakers 50,000 \u2013 70,000, Occitans 20,000 \u2013 40,000, Ladins 30,000, Catalans 15,000, Greek-speakers 12,000, Croatians 3,000 and Friulians 600,000. The Roma community is one of the largest ethnic minorities in Italy. Due to the lack of disaggregated data the size of the Italian Roma community remains unknown. The Council of Europe estimates that between 120,000 and 180,000 Roma live in Italy. A significant proportion of Roma in Italy don\u2019t have Italian citizenship.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n\n\n* List of Italians\n* Italian diaspora\n* Italian Americans\n* Italian Brazilians\n* Italian Argentines\n* Italian Venezuelans\n* Romani people in Italy\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n\n1. **^** The figures for 2002\u20132011 have been revised downwards as a result of the 15th General Census of Italy which offered more precise data.

Interestingly, although Iron Age individuals were sampled from both Etruscan (n=3) and Latin (n=6) contexts, we did not detect any significant differences between the two groups with f4 statistics in the form of f4(RMPR\\_Etruscan, RMPR\\_Latin; test population, Onge), suggesting shared origins or extensive genetic exchange between them. ... In the Medieval and early modern periods (n = 28 individuals), we observe an ancestry shift toward central and northern Europe in PCA (Fig. 3E), as well as a further increase in the European cluster (C7) and loss of the Near Eastern and eastern Mediterranean clusters (C4 and C5) in ChromoPainter (Fig. 4C). The Medieval population is roughly centered on modern-day central Italians (Fig. 3F). It can be modeled as a two-way combination of Rome's Late Antique population and a European donor population, with potential sources including many ancient and modern populations in central and northern Europe: Lombards from Hungary, Saxons from England, and Vikings from Sweden, among others (table S26).\n119. **^** Ralph P, Coop G (2013). \"The geography of recent genetic ancestry across Europe\". *PLOS Biology*. **11** (5): e1001555. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001555.

In the first decade of the third millennium, population growth in France was the highest in Europe, matched only by that of the Republic of Ireland, which has also historically undergone stagnant growth and even decline relative to the rest of Europe until recently. However, it is lower than that of the United States, largely because of the latter's higher net migration rate.\n\n\n\n### Historical summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Period[32] | Life expectancy inYears\n | Period[32] | Life expectancy inYears\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\u20131955\n | 67.2\n | 1985\u20131990\n | 76.1\n |\n| 1955\u20131960\n | 69.3\n | 1990\u20131995\n | 77.3\n |\n| 1960\u20131965\n | 70.7\n | 1995\u20132000\n | 78.4\n |\n| 1965\u20131970\n | 71.4\n | 2000\u20132005\n | 79.6\n |\n| 1970\u20131975\n | 72.4\n | 2005\u20132010\n | 80.9\n |\n| 1975\u20131980\n | 73.6\n | 2010\u20132015\n | 81.9\n |\n| 1980\u20131985\n | 74.7\n | 2015-2020\n | 82.4\n |\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\nAge structures of the France m\u00e9tropolitaine from the year 1740 to 2021.

During the Middle Ages, more than one-quarter of Europe's total population was French;[8] by the seventeenth century, this had decreased slightly to one-fifth. By the beginning of the nineteen century, other European countries, such as Germany and Russia, had caught up with France and overtaken it in number of people. However, the country's population sharply increased with the baby boom following World War II. According to INSEE, since 2004, 200,000 immigrants entered the country annually. One out of two was born in Europe and one in three in Africa. Between 2009 and 2012, the number of Europeans entering France increased sharply (plus 12% per year on average), but would steadily decline by 2022, as more Africans began entering France.[9][10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince the 19th century, France has continued being a country of immigration. During the *Trente Glorieuses* (1946\u20131975), the country's reconstruction and steady economic growth led to the labor-immigration of the 1960s, when many employers found manpower in villages located in Southern Europe and North Africa. In 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE estimated that 11.8 million foreign-born immigrants and their direct descendants (second generation) lived in France representing 19% of the country's population. About 5.5 million are of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi origin.[88][89]\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

the number of foreigners living in metropolitan France amounted to 3.5 million people. Two out of five foreigners are from Portugal, Algeria or Morocco. Thus, EU nationals immigrating to France comprise 1.2 million people, and 1.1 million people are from the three Maghreb countries of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Immigrants are concentrated in \u00cele-de-France, Rhone-Alpes, Provence and C\u00f4te d'Azur regions, accounting for 60% of the total immigrant population. Furthermore, there appears to be a lower rate of immigrants arriving from the EU since 1975 as opposed to an increase in African immigrants.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrench concerns about the country's slow population growth began after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. For four years in the 1890s, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births. The National Alliance for the Growth of the French Population (ANAPF) was formed in 1896, and the Cognacq-Jay and other prizes were created for the parents of large families. \u00c9mile Zola's 1899 novel *F\u00e9condit\u00e9* is representative of contemporary concerns about the birthrate. France lost 10% of its active male population in World War I; the 1.3 million French deaths, along with even more births forgone by potential fathers being off at war, caused a drop of 3 million in the French population, and helped make *D\u00e9natalit\u00e9* a national obsession; by 1920 ANAPF had 40,000 members, and in July that year a new law strictly regulated abortion and contraception.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Birth country of parents\n | Years\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | 1999\n | 2000\n | 2001\n | 2002\n | 2003\n | 2004\n | 2005\n | 2006\n | 2007\n | 2008\n | 2009\n | 2010\n | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n |\n| Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | %\n |\n| **Both parents born in France** | 566 447 | 576 537 | 601 268 | 595 286 | 580 999 | 575 985 | 574 687 | 575 659 | 590 163 | 579 515 | 585 427 | 578 052 | 583 600 | 72.7% | 604 077 | 598 473 | 583 864 | 579 106 | 70.75%\n |\n| **One parent born in France, other foreign-born** | 101 511 | 98 687 | 101 498 | 102 013 | 103 930 | 106 677 | 110 258 | 114 090 | 119 159 | 119 587 | 121 845 | 125 058 | 129 025 | 16.1% | 119 114 | 119 957 | 119 643 | 123 855 | 15.13%\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe birth rate in France diminished much earlier than in the rest of Europe in part because inheritance laws dictated distribution of estates whereas in the UK wealth could be passed to the eldest son or child.[*original research?*] The country's large population gave Napoleon a seemingly limitless supply of men for the Grande Arm\u00e9e, but the birth rate began to fall in the late 18th century;[20] thus population growth was quite slow in the 19th century, and the nadir was reached in the first half of the 20th century when France, surrounded by the rapidly growing populations of Germany and the United Kingdom, had virtually zero growth.

A longitudinal study has been conducted since March 2010 to provide qualitative research regarding the integration of new immigrants.[150] The report is being finalized at the end of December 2010 and will be most relevant to provide insight into further immigration policy analysis for the French government.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1806  | 29,107,000 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1821  | 30,462,000 | +0.30% |\n| 1831  | 32,569,000 | +0.67% |\n| 1841  | 34,230,000 | +0.50% |\n| 1851  | 35,783,000 | +0.44% |\n| 1872  | 36,103,000 | +0.04% |\n| 1881  | 37,672,000 | +0.47% |\n| 1891  | 38,343,000 | +0.18% |\n| 1901  | 38,962,000 | +0.16% |\n| 1911  | 39,605,000 | +0.16% |\n| 1921  | 39,108,000 | \u22120.13% |\n| 1931  | 41,524,000 | +0.60% |\n| 1946  | 40,125,230 | \u22120.23% |\n| 1950  | 41,647,258 | +0.94% |\n| 1960  | 45,464,797 | +0.88% |\n| 1970  | 50,528,219 | +1.06% |\n| 1980  | 53,731,387 | +0.62% |\n| 1990  | 56,577,000 | +0.52% |\n| 2000  | 58,858,198 | +0.40% |\n| 2010  | 62,765,235 | +0.64% |\n| 2020  | 67,287,241 | +0.70% |\n| 2022  | 67,813,396 | +0.39% |\n| Source: [23] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Paris region** is a magnet for immigrants, hosting one of the largest concentrations of immigrants in Europe. As of 2006, about 45% of people (6 million) living in the region were either immigrant (25%) or born to at least one immigrant parent (20%).[82]\n\n\nOf European ethnic groups not indigenous to France, the most numerous are people of Italian family origin and it is estimated that about 5 million citizens (8% of the population) are at least partly of Italian origin if their parentage is retraced over three generations.[83] This is due to waves of Italian immigration, notably during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Other large European groups of non-native origin are Spaniards, Portuguese, Romanians, Poles, and Greeks. Also, due to more recent immigration, between five and six million people of Maghrebi origin[84] and approximately 800,000 Turks inhabit France.[85][86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* figures are for metropolitan France **only**, not including overseas departments and territories, as former French colonies and protectorates.

Half of them were of European ancestry (including 5.2 million from South Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal and former Yugoslavia)). The rest were from Maghreb (3 million), Sub-Saharan Africa (680,000), Turkey (320,000) and other parts of the world (2.5 million).[105] Immigrants from the Maghreb are commonly referred to as *beur*, a verlan slang term derived from the word *arabe* (French for Arab).[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 20th century, France experienced a high rate of immigration from other countries. The immigration rate was particularly high during the 1920s and 1930s. France was the European country which suffered the most from World War I, with respect to the size of its population, losing 1.3 million young men out of a total population of 40 million. France was also at the time the European country with the lowest fertility rate, which meant that the country had a very hard time recovering from the heavy losses of the war. France had to open its doors to immigration, which was the only way to prevent population decline between the two world wars.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 18 January 2008, the government published a list of 150 job titles that were encountering difficult supply of labour.[148] Most immigrants living in France today are reported to cover the following sectors: agriculture, service to persons in need (childcare, the elderly), construction, education, health and services to businesses.[149] Thus, the government is seeking to match immigrants with the economic makeup of France. The current administration could also seek to integrate migrants and their families through education and training, making them more competitive in the job market. To tackle critical labour shortages, France also decided to participate in the EU Blue Card.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn influx of Maghrebi Jews immigrated to France in the 1950s and after the Algerian War due to the decline of the French empire. Subsequent waves of immigration followed the Six-Day War, when some Moroccan and Tunisian Jews settled in France. Hence, by 1968, Maghrebi Jews were about 500,000 and the majority in France. As the majority of these new immigrants were already culturally French, because of their cooperation with colonists, they needed little time to adjust to French society.[*citation needed*] Black people come from both the French overseas territories (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, R\u00e9union, and former colony Haiti) and Sub-Saharan Africa (especially Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal). France has the largest black population in Europe.\n\n\nThere is a substantial Romani population in France. There is approximately 400,000 Roma living in France.\n[87]\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Europe | * Albanian\n* Britons\n* Bulgarians\n* Czech\n* Germans\n* Greeks\n* Italians\n* Macedonians\n* Poles\n* Portuguese\n* Romanians\n* Russians\n* Chechens\n* Serbs\n* Spaniards\n* Swiss\n |\n| North America | * Americans\n\t+ African Americans\n* Canadians\n* Haitians\n* Mexicans\n |\n| South America | * Argentines\n* Brazilians\n* Chileans\n* Peruvians\n* Uruguayans\n |\n| * Demographics of France\n* French people living outside France\n* Immigration to France\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Algeria | 887,100\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | 834,600\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 598,500\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | 316,100\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Italy | 287,800\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 250,500\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Spain | 243,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 144,900\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Romania | 137,900\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 126,500\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | 122,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ivory Coast | 119,300\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0China | 108,500\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Germany | 106,600\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0DR Congo | 98,800\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | 98,700\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Haiti | 98,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mali | 96,400\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 88,100\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Madagascar | 85,000\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Poland | 83,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | 78,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Congo | 76,000\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 73,500\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Father born in EU28, mother born in France | 13 194 | 12 858 | 13 060 | 12 447 | 11 732 | 11 442 | 10 811 | 10 667 | 10 455 | 10 188 | 9 975 | 9 526 | 9 549 | 1.2% | 9 961 | 9 637 | 9 414 | 9 235 | 1.13%\n |\n| Father not born in EU28, mother born in France | 44 891 | 43 807 | 45 612 | 46 459 | 47 695 | 49 790 | 52 244 | 54 176 | 56 886 | 56 626 | 57 955 | 60 362 | 62 478 | 7.8% | 55 209 | 55 488 | 55 397 | 56 370 | 6.89%\n |\n| Father born in France, mother born in EU28 | 13 020 | 12 647 | 12 411 | 11 881 | 11 439 | 11 119 | 10 930 | 10 827 | 10 794 | 10 575 | 10 562 | 10 585 | 10 418 | 1.3% | 10 104 | 9 761 | 9 772 | 10 058 | 1.23%\n |\n| Father born in France, mother not born in EU28 | 30 406 | 29 375 | 30 415 | 31 226 | 33 064 | 34 326 | 36 273 | 38 420 | 41 024 | 42 198 | 43 353 | 44 585 | 46 580 | 5.8% | 43 840 | 45 071 | 45 060 | 48 192 | 5.89%\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"IFRI - E-note - Notes de l'Ifri - France: the State strives to shape \"chosen\" immigration - Institut fran\u00e7ais des relations internationales\". 26 July 2011.

Again, as in the 1920s and 1930s, France stands in contrast with the rest of Europe. Back in the 1920s and 1930s, when other European countries had a high fertility rate, France had a low fertility rate and opened its doors to immigration to avoid a population decline. Today, it is the rest of Europe that has very low fertility rates, and countries like Germany or Spain avoid population decline only through immigration. In France, however, the fertility rate is still fairly high for European standards. It is, in fact, the highest in Europe after Ireland (the EU) and Albania (perhaps higher than Ireland's) and so most population growth is due to natural increase, unlike in the other European countries.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe screening suggests that in 2000, 19 percent of all newborn babies in Metropolitan France had at least one parent originating from one of the risk regions.[77] The figure for 2007 was 28.45 percent, for 2010 31.5 percent, for 2012 34.44 percent, for 2013 35.7 percent,[78][79] and for 2015 38.9 percent.[78] These percentages vary widely among French regions; for example, in 2015, screening suggested that only 8.1% of children born in Brittany had a parent originating from a sickle-cell risk region, while 73.4% of children born in \u00cele-de-France (which includes Paris) did.[80] The percentage for \u00cele-de-France was a significant increase from 54.2% in 2007. However, a 2014 story in *Le Monde* suggested that the testing figures for \u00cele-de-France were perhaps distorted by the practices of some hospitals in the region, which choose to test all babies whether or not they have parents with ancestry from an endemic sickle-cell region.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** \"Tableau VI.1\u00a0: D\u00e9pistage de la Dr\u00e9panocytose en 2015\" (PDF). *Bilan AFDPHE 2015*.

One reason for this could be France's relatively high unemployment, which the country has struggled to reduce for the past two decades. There is also a parallel dynamic between immigration and unemployment. Immigrants tend to be subjected to higher rates of unemployment. In 2008, the immigrant unemployment rate in France was a startling 13%, twice as high as for the national population (6%).[126] One can further analyse the trend in relation to education. In the ministry's 2010 report on professional inclusion for immigrants, 19.6% of immigrants without any education were unemployed while 16.1% of immigrants who had graduated high school were unemployed. Only 11.4% of immigrants with an undergraduate degree or higher were unemployed.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Most immigrants were Portuguese as well as Arabs and Berbers from North Africa. The first wave arrived in the 1950s, but the major arrivals happened in the 1960s and 1970s. More than one million people from the Maghreb immigrated in the 1960s and early 1970s from North Africa, especially Algeria (following the end of French rule there) [*citation needed*]. One million European *pieds noirs* also migrated from Algeria in 1962 and the following years during the chaotic independence of Algeria.[96] France has over three million French of Algerian descent, a small percentage of whom are third-or fourth-generation French.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** Cohen, Robin (2 November 1995). *The Cambridge Survey of World Migration*.

The following summer of 2007, Sarkozy amended the law to require the acquisition of the French language as a pre-condition. According to Christophe Bertossi, immigration expert in France's Institut fran\u00e7ais des relations internationales (IFRI), \"there is a dominant trend in the French policy to stem family migration, notably conditioned after the 2007 law by a minimum level of French language tested and by the demonstration that he/she endorses the main French constitutional principles\".[145]\n\n\n  \n\nDespite Sarkozy's law, immigration from former colonies in the Maghreb and West Africa would end up steadily increasing under the presidencies of Nicolas Sarkozy, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Emmanuel Macron.[146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year | Population | Year | Population | Year | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 50 BC | 2,500,000 | 1806 | 29,648,000 | 1896 | 40,158,000\n |\n| 1 | 5,500,000 | 1811 | 30,271,000 | 1901 | 40,681,000\n |\n| 120 | 7,200,000 | 1816 | 30,573,000 | 1906 | 41,067,000\n |\n| 400 | 5,500,000 | 1821 | 31,578,000 | 1911 | 41,415,000\n |\n| 850 | 7,000,000 | 1826 | 32,665,000 | 1921 | 39,108,000\n |\n| 1226 | 16,000,000 | 1831 | 33,595,000 | 1926 | 40,581,000\n |\n| 1345 | 20,200,000 | 1836 | 34,293,000 | 1931 | 41,524,000\n |\n| 1400 | 16,600,000 | 1841 | 34,912,000 | 1936 | 41,502,000\n |\n| 1457 | 19,700,000 | 1846 | 36,097,000 | 1946 | 40,506,639\n |\n| 1580 | 20,000,000 | 1851 | 36,472,000 | 1954 | 42,777,162\n |\n| 1594 | 18,500,000 | 1856 | 36,715,000 | 1962 | 46,519,997\n |\n| 1600 | 20,000,000 | 1861 | 37,386,000 | 1968 | 49,780,543\n |\n| 1670 | 18,000,000 | 1866 | 38,067,000 | 1975 | 52,655,864\n |\n| 1700 | 21,000,000 | 1872 | 37,653,000 | 1982 | 54,334,871\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the French Institute, the increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France.[9]\nStatistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107% between 2009 and 2012, from 5300 to 11,000 people.[9][114]\n\n\nOf 229,000 foreigners in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, British 5%, Spanish 5%, Italians 4%, Germans 4%, Romanians 3%, Belgians 3% and Dutch 2%.[9]\n\n\nWith the increase of Spanish, Portuguese and Italians in France, in 2012 46% of immigrants were European, while the percentage for African immigrants reached 30%, of which Moroccans were 7%, Algerians 7%, and Tunisians 3%. Meanwhile, 14% of all immigrants who settled in France in that year were from Asian countries: 3% from China, 2% from Turkey, 10% from America and Oceania, Americans and Brazilians accounting for 2% each.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew laws in November 1938 and July 1939, the *code de la famille*, provided enough financial incentives for large families to double the income of a family with six children. The Vichy government approved of the laws and implemented them as part of its *Travail, famille, patrie* national motto, as did the postwar Provisional Government of the French Republic.[21][20][22] Also, France encouraged immigration, chiefly from other European countries such as Italy, Poland, and Spain. (In fact, with its low birth rate, stagnating or declining native-born population, and role as a destination for migrants from other parts of Europe, France's situation before World War II was not unlike that of Germany today.)\n\n\n\n### After World War II[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 1970s, the end of high economic growth in France caused immigration policies to be considerably tightened, starting with laws by Charles Pasqua passed in 1986 and 1993. New immigrants were allowed only through the family reunion schemes (wives and children moving to France to live with husbands or fathers already living in France), or as asylum seekers. Illegal immigration thus developed as immigration policy became more rigid. In 2006, The French Ministry of the Interior estimated clandestine immigrants in France amounted to anywhere between 200,000 and 400,000 and expected between 80,000 and 100,000 people to enter the country illegally each year.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPopulation Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.I.2021) (Excluding diplomatic personnel outside the country and including members of\nalien armed forces not living in military camps and foreign diplomatic personnel not living in embassies or consulates.): [49]\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 31 679 652\n | 33 767 802\n | 65 447 454\n | 100\n |\n| 0\u20134\n | 1 760 893\n | 1 687 156\n | 3 448 049\n | 5.27\n |\n| 5\u20139\n | 1 987 773\n | 1 899 786\n | 3 887 559\n | 5.94\n |\n| 10\u201314\n | 2 094 546\n | 1 994 602\n | 4 089 148\n | 6.25\n |\n| 15\u201319\n | 2 067 605\n | 1 953 663\n | 4 021 268\n | 6.14\n |\n| 20\u201324\n | 1 920 746\n | 1 841 850\n | 3 762 596\n | 5.75\n |\n| 25\u201329\n | 1 790 516\n | 1 806 271\n | 3 596 787\n | 5.50\n |\n| 30\u201334\n | 1 924 391\n | 2 013 946\n | 3 938 337\n | 6.02\n |\n| 35\u201339\n | 1 993 274\n | 2 096 326\n | 4 089 600\n | 6.25\n |\n| 40\u201344\n | 1 982 775\n | 2 048 758\n | 4 031 533\n | 6.16\n |\n| 45\u201349\n | 2 140 131\n | 2 174 545\n | 4 314 676\n | 6.59\n |\n| 50\u201354\n | 2 117 292\n | 2 178 427\n | 4 295 719\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. **^** \"Mich\u00e8le Tribalat's 2004 study for the INE\". *Ined.fr*.

In addition, the country's birth rate dropped significantly during this time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe large-scale immigration from Islamic countries has sparked controversy in France. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Overviews | * History\n* Timeline\n* Political history\n* Military history\n* Language\n* Economic\n* Foreign relations\n* Journalism\n* Liberalism and radicalism\n |\n| Regions | * History of Brittany\n* History of Normandy\n |\n| Ancient | * Prehistory\n* Greek colonies\n* Celtic Gaul\n* Roman Gaul\n |\n| Middle Ages | * Visigothic Kingdom\n* Francia\n\t+ West Francia\n* Middle Ages\n* Kingdom of France\n\t+ Fundamental laws\n |\n| Early Modern | * Early modern era\n* House of Bourbon\n* Absolute monarchy\n* *Ancien R\u00e9gime*\n* Wars of Religion\n* Thirty Years' War\n* Peace of Westphalia\n* Second Hundred Years' War\n* Louis XIV\n* War of the Spanish Succession\n* Diplomatic Revolution of 1756\n* Seven Years' War\n |\n| Revolution | * French Revolution\n* Napoleonic era\n* First Republic\n* First Empire\n |\n| Late Modern | * Long nineteenth century\n* Restoration\n* July Monarchy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIts pillars of immigration policy are to regulate migratory flows in and out of France, facilitate immigrants' integration and promote French identity, honor the French tradition's principle of welcoming political asylum and promote solidarity within the immigrant population (principle of co-development).[143] In its 2010 Budget report, the Ministry of Immigration declared it would fund \u20ac600 million for its immigration policy objectives, a figure representing 60 million more than in 2009 (otherwise an 11.5% increase from 2009 figures).[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mali | 3 875 (0.48) | 4 407 (0.56) | 4 337 (0.54) | 4 504 (0.58) | 4 476 (0.57) | 4 492 (0.59) | 4 429 (0.59) | 4 732 (0.65) | 4 799 (0.67) | 4 755 (0.67) | 4 786 (0.69) | 4 847 (0.69) | 5 073 (0.74) | 3 129 (0.39) | 3 061 (0.39) | 2 959 (0.37) | 3 143 (0.40) | 3 079 (0.39) | 3 074 (0.40) | 3 263 (0.44) | 3 272 (0.45) | 3 412 (0.47) | 3 413 (0.48) | 3 391 (0.49) | 3 379 (0.48) | 3 541 (0.52)\n |\n| Comoros | 2 033 (0.25) | 2 535 (0.32) | 2 840 (0.36) | 2 803 (0.36) | 2 902 (0.37) | 3 097 (0.41) | 3 156 (0.42) | 3 494 (0.48) | 3 564 (0.50) | 3 751 (0.53) | 3 705 (0.53) | 3 796 (0.54) | 3 948 (0.58) | 2 090 (0.26) | 2 208 (0.28) | 2 298 (0.29) | 2 386 (0.31) | 2 513 (0.32) | 2 679 (0.35) | 2 689 (0.36) | 2 952 (0.40) | 3 077 (0.43) | 3 237 (0.45) | 3 191 (0.46) | 3 229 (0.46) | 3 408 (0.50)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs mentioned above, the French Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Codevelopment was created immediately following the appointment of Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France in 2007.

The other major European powers, such as the UK or Germany, still had high fertility rates, so immigration was seen as unnecessary, and it was also undesirable to the vast majority of their populations. The majority of immigrants in the 1920s came from Italy and Poland, though from the 1930s, some also came from elsewhere in southern and eastern Europe, and the first wave of colonial French subjects from Africa and Asia. This mass immigration was ended and partially reversed by the economic problems of the 1930s.[93] By the end of the Spanish Civil War, some half-million Spanish Republican refugees had crossed\nthe border into France.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Senegal | 3 811 (0.48) | 4 354 (0.55) | 4 679 (0.59) | 4 966 (0.64) | 5 213 (0.67) | 5 274 (0.69) | 5 352 (0.72) | 5 570 (0.76) | 5 915 (0.82) | 6 090 (0.85) | 6 061 (0.87) | 5 969 (0.85) | 6 347 (0.92) | 3 548 (0.44) | 3 589 (0.45) | 3 901 (0.49) | 4 107 (0.53) | 4 330 (0.55) | 4 279 (0.56) | 4 348 (0.58) | 4 581 (0.63) | 4 761 (0.66) | 4 954 (0.69) | 5 039 (0.72) | 4 798 (0.68) | 5 244 (0.76)\n |\n| Guinea | 1 356 (0.17) | 1 895 (0.24) | 2 045 (0.26) | 2 214 (0.28) | 2 390 (0.31) | 2 526 (0.33) | 2 593 (0.35) | 2 990 (0.41) | 3 179 (0.44) | 4 412 (0.62) | 4 543 (0.65) | 4 950 (0.71) | 5 659 (0.82) | 1 499 (0.19) | 1 756 (0.22) | 1 858 (0.24) | 1 970 (0.25) | 2 136 (0.27) | 2 251 (0.30) | 2 279 (0.31) | 2 595 (0.36) | 2 792 (0.39) | 3 852 (0.54) | 3 936 (0.56) | 4 203 (0.60) | 4 814 (0.70)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ivory Coast | 2 209 (0.28) | 3 446 (0.43) | 3 658 (0.46) | 4 093 (0.52) | 4 360 (0.56) | 4 470 (0.59) | 4 601 (0.62) | 5 082 (0.70) | 5 715 (0.79) | 6 832 (0.96) | 6 915 (0.99) | 7 150 (1.02) | 8 388 (1.22) | 2 483 (0.31) | 3 257 (0.41) | 3 535 (0.45) | 3 829 (0.49) | 4 077 (0.52) | 4 144 (0.54) | 4 308 (0.58) | 4 817 (0.66) | 5 445 (0.76) | 6 403 (0.90) | 6 295 (0.90) | 6 500 (0.93) | 7 647 (1.11)\n |\n| Congo | 3 908 (0.49) | 6 367 (0.80) | 6 361 (0.80) | 6 752 (0.86) | 6 872 (0.88) | 6 823 (0.90) | 7 022 (0.94) | 7 317 (1.00) | 7 444 (1.03) | 7 299 (1.02) | 7 050 (1.01) | 6 697 (0.95) | 6 867 (1.00) | 4 000 (0.50) | 5 612 (0.71) | 5 772 (0.73) | 6 119 (0.78) | 6 372 (0.82) | 6 210 (0.82) | 6 384 (0.86) | 6 560 (0.90) | 6 603 (0.92) | 6 519 (0.91) | 6 153 (0.88) | 5 929 (0.84) | 6 003 (0.87)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **North Africa** | **67 073 (8.36)** | **70 630 (8.91)** | **71 120 (9.00)** | **73 032 (9.34)** | **74 228 (9.50)** | **73 261 (9.63)** | **72 808 (9.78)** | **71 886 (9.84)** | **70 654 (9.82)** | **69 845 (9.78)** | **66 174 (9.50)** | **62 218 (8.87)** | **62 811 (9.15)** | **58 124 (7.25)** | **58 947 (7.43)** | **59 694 (7.55)** | **62 286 (7.97)** | **64 088 (8.20)** | **64 022 (8.42)** | **64 081 (8.60)** | **63 763 (8.73)** | **62 963 (8.75)** | **62 900 (8.81)** | **58 767 (8.44)** | **54 920 (7.83)** | **54 906 (8.00)** |\n| Algeria | 27 817 (3.47) | 28 628 (3.61) | 29 193 (3.69) | 30 278 (3.87) | 30 909 (3.96) | 30 930 (4.07) | 31 405 (4.22) | 30 693 (4.20) | 30 583 (4.25) | 30 080 (4.21) | 28 382 (4.07) | 26 349 (3.75) | 26 981 (3.93) | 25 847 (3.22) | 25 831 (3.26) | 26 408 (3.34) | 27 905 (3.57) | 28 899 (3.70) | 29 240 (3.85) | 29 984 (4.03) | 29 256 (4.01) | 29 102 (4.04) | 28 780 (4.03) | 26 469 (3.80) | 24 257 (3.46) | 24 329 (3.54)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 Sephardic North African Jews from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco also immigrated to France because of the decline of the French colonial empire and following the Six-Day War. Hence, by 1968, Sephardic North African Jews were the majority of the Jews in France. As the new immigrants were already culturally French, they needed little time to adjust to French society.[98]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"Les Gaulois figurent seulement parmi d'autres dans la multitude de couches de peuplement fort divers (Ligures, Ib\u00e8res, Latins, Francs et Alamans, Nordiques, Sarrasins...) qui aboutissent \u00e0 la population du pays \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 \", Jean-Louis Brunaux, *Nos anc\u00eatres les Gaulois*, \u00e9d.

immigrants live secluded from society with very few capabilities to live in better conditions, the integration of Muslim immigrants is happening as part of a background evolution[107] and recent studies confirmed the results of their assimilation, showing that \"North Africans seem to be characterized by a high degree of cultural integration reflected in a relatively high propensity to exogamy\" with rates ranging from 20% to 50%.[108] According to Emmanuel Todd, the relatively high exogamy among French Algerians can be explained by the colonial link between France and Algeria.[109][110] One illustration of this growing resentment and job insecurity can be drawn from related events, such as the 2005 riots, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Immigrants by origin (2008) in

aspect of immigration, giving more power to the police, allowing them to perform random identity checks and deport immigrants without legal papers. The rise in anti-immigration sentiments was reinforced by a series of terrorist bombs in Paris in 1986, linked to Muslim immigrants in France.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Two centuries of population growth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1.1\n | 1.990\n | 3.6\n | 77.6 | 84.3\n |\n| 2009\n | 62,465,709\n | 793,420 | 538,166 | 255,254\n | 12.7 | 8.6 | 4.2\n | 0.6\n | 1.989\n | 3.7\n | 77.7 | 84.4\n |\n| 2010\n | 62,765,235\n | 802,224 | 540,469 | 261,755\n | 12.8 | 8.6 | 4.2\n | 0.7\n | 2.016\n | 3.6\n | 78.0 | 84.6\n |\n| 2011\n | 63,070,344\n | 792,996 | 534,795 | 258,201\n | 12.5 | 8.5 | 4.1\n | 0.7\n | 1.996\n | 3.5\n | 78.4 | 85.0\n |\n| 2012\n | 63,375,971\n | 790,290 | 559,227 | 231,063\n | 12.4 | 8.8 | 3.6\n | 1.5\n | 1.992\n | 3.5\n | 78.5 | 84.8\n |\n| 2013\n | 63,697,865\n | 781,621 | 558,408 | 223,213\n | 12.3 | 8.8 | 3.5\n | 1.7\n | 1.973\n | 3.6\n | 78.7 | 85.0\n |\n| 2014\n | 64,027,958\n | 781,167 | 547,003 | 234,164\n | 12.2 | 8.5 | 3.6\n | 0.7\n | 1.974\n | 3.5\n | 79.2 | 85.4\n |\n| 2015\n | 64,300,821\n | 760,421 | 581,770 | 178,651\n | 11.8 | 9.0 | 2.8\n | -0.2\n | 1.925\n | 3.7\n | 79.0 | 85.1\n |\n| 2016\n | 64,468,792\n | 744,697 | 581,073 | 163,624\n | 11.5 | 9.0 | 2.5\n | 0.1\n | 1.891\n | 3.7\n | 79.3 | 85.3\n |\n| 2017\n | 64,639,133\n | 730,242 | 593,606 | 136,636\n | 11.3 | 9.2 | 2.1\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Region\n | 2004\n | 2005\n | 2006\n | 2007\n | 2008\n | 2009\n | 2010\n | 2011\n | 2012\n | % 2012\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Europe | 80 500 | 78 660 | 80 120 | 79 290 | 80 330 | 75 040 | 88 820 | 94 580 | 105 830 | 46\u00a0% (including from Eastern Europe)\n |\n| Africa | 70 200 | 66 110 | 62 340 | 62 140 | 63 470 | 66 480 | 65 610 | 66 280 | 68 640 | 30\u00a0% (including from Maghreb)\n |\n| Asia | 30 960 | 30 120 | 30 520 | 32 070 | 30 180 | 32 960 | 29 810 | 32 430 | 32 060 | 14\u00a0% (including from China)\n |\n| America and Oceania | 19 810 | 19 990 | 20 460 | 18 770 | 21 440 | 20 450 | 26 270 | 23 360 | 23 070 | 10%\n |\n| All countries | 201 470 | 194 880 | 193 440 | 192 270 | 195 420 | 194 930 | 210 510 | 216 650 | 229 600 | 100%\n |\n\n\n### Before World War II[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mauritania | 793 (0.10) | 999 (0.13) | 965 (0.12) | 1 053 (0.13) | 1 061 (0.14) | 1 080 (0.14) | 1 101 (0.15) | 1 092 (0.15) | 1 107 (0.15) | 1 135 (0.16) | 1 137 (0.16) | 1 096 (0.16) | 1 237 (0.18) | 524 (0.07) | 583 (0.07) | 593 (0.08) | 622 (0.08) | 663 (0.08) | 670 (0.09) | 644 (0.09) | 694 (0.10) | 716 (0.10) | 723 (0.10) | 752 (0.11) | 716 (0.10) | 806 (0.12)\n |\n| Cape Verde | 616 (0.08) | 839 (0.11) | 890 (0.11) | 956 (0.12) | 1 064 (0.14) | 1 179 (0.16) | 1 202 (0.16) | 1 191 (0.16) | 1 167 (0.16) | 1 222 (0.17) | 1 131 (0.16) | 1 096 (0.16) | 1 229 (0.18) | 594 (0.07) | 649 (0.08) | 701 (0.09) | 778 (0.10) | 865 (0.11) | 980 (0.13) | 944 (0.13) | 1 001 (0.14) | 960 (0.13) | 993 (0.14) | 938 (0.13) | 911 (0.13) | 1 026 (0.15)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Romania | 1 866 (0.23) | 2 477 (0.31) | 2 906 (0.37) | 3 076 (0.39) | 3 438 (0.44) | 3 891 (0.51) | 4 297 (0.58) | 4 583 (0.63) | 4 670 (0.65) | 4 813 (0.67) | 4 806 (0.69) | 4 806 (0.68) | 4 612 (0.67) | 2 651 (0.33) | 2 964 (0.37) | 3 434 (0.43) | 3 592 (0.46) | 4 046 (0.52) | 4 453 (0.59) | 4 825 (0.65) | 5 112 (0.70) | 5 059 (0.70) | 5 210 (0.73) | 5 096 (0.73) | 5 127 (0.73) | 4 872 (0.71)\n |\n| Italy | 1 458 (0.18) | 1 584 (0.20) | 1 550 (0.20) | 1 521 (0.19) | 1 628 (0.21) | 1 753 (0.23) | 1 788 (0.24) | 1 752 (0.24) | 1 770 (0.25) | 1 867 (0.26) | 1 857 (0.27) | 1 992 (0.28) | 1 894 (0.28) | 1 231 (0.15) | 1 283 (0.16) | 1 278 (0.16) | 1 320 (0.17) | 1 440 (0.18) | 1 520 (0.20) | 1 652 (0.22) | 1 702 (0.23) | 1 817 (0.25) | 1 830 (0.26) | 1 993 (0.29) | 2 123 (0.30) | 2 069 (0.30)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** \"Archived copy\" (PDF).

At the beginning of 2008, as the government was rethinking its orientation on immigration policy with the creation of the new ministry, the idea of a quota system was introduced as a possible alternative. In early 2008, a proposal was made to Parliament to decide each year how many immigrants to accept, based on skill and origin. However, this quota policy contradicts the French Constitution. A commission was formed in February 2008 to study how the Constitution could be changed to allow for a quota system. The main difficulty is the origin principle of establishing a quota \"constituting a breach in the universalistic ideology of the French Republic\".[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Total** | **802 224 (100)** | **792 996 (100)** | **790 290 (100)** | **781 621 (100)** | **781 167 (100)** | **760 421 (100)** | **744 697 (100)** | **730 242 (100)** | **719 737 (100)** | **714 029 (100)** | **696 664 (100)** | **701 819 (100)** | **686 564 (100)** | **802 224 (100)** | **792 996 (100)** | **790 290 (100)** | **781 621 (100)** | **781 167 (100)** | **760 421 (100)** | **744 697 (100)** | **730 242 (100)** | **719 737 (100)** | **714 029 (100)** | **696 664 (100)** | **701 819 (100)** |  **686 564 (100)** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Foreingers** | **161 626 (20.15)** | **160 789 (20.28)** | **162 925 (20.62)** | **168 197 (21.52)** | **172 521 (22.09)** | **172 273 (22.65)** | **173 422 (23.29)** | **174 268 (23.86)** | **175 017 (24.32)** | **177 786 (24.90)** | **171 946 (24.68)** | **167 525 (23.87)** | **172 562 (25.13)** | **146 597 (18.27)** | **148 673 (18.75)** | **151 772 (19.20)** | **157 473 (20.15)** | **163 428 (20.92)** | **163 598 (21.51)** | **165 625 (22.24)** | **166 457 (22.79)** | **167 236 (23.24)** | **170 732 (23.91)** | **164 006 (23.54)** | **159 253 (22.69)** | **162 585 (23.68)** |\n| **Foreingers detail\u00a0:** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \" Les Sarrasins gard\u00e8rent longtemps sur les c\u00f4tes de la Provence, \u00e0 la Garde-Freinet, un solide point d'appui et de l\u00e0 purent faire des incursions dans une partie de la France.

The regions of emigrations also widened, with new immigrants now coming from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In the 1970s, a small but well-publicized wave of Chilean and Argentine political refugees from their countries' dictatorships found asylum in France.\n\n\nEthnic Vietnamese started to become a visible segment of society after the massive influx of refugees after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The expulsions of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam in the 1970s led to a wave of immigration and the settlement of the high-rise neighbourhood near the *Porte d'Italie*, where the Chinatown of Paris is located. Located in the 13th arrondissement, the area contains many ethnic Chinese inhabitants.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mauritius | 410 (0.05) | 463 (0.06) | 437 (0.06) | 420 (0.05) | 434 (0.06) |

reunification and national identity. Institut fran\u00e7ais des relations internationales\n(IFRI) immigration expert, Christophe Bertossi, states that stigmatized as both a challenge to social cohesion and a \"burden\" for the French economy, family immigration is increasingly restricted and constructed as a racial issue. The \"immigration choisie\" policy strives consequently to select migrants according to their profile, skills and, still indirectly, origins.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. **^** \"Bien que le s\u00e9jour des Arabes en France n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 que par une s\u00e9rie de courtes invasions, ils ont laiss\u00e9 des traces profondes de leur passage dans la langue, et [...] ils en ont laiss\u00e9 \u00e9galement dans le sang.

birth rates to decline helped defeat proposals before World War II to permit women to vote. The birth rate declined again after a brief baby boom from 1920 to 1923, and reached an all-time low during peacetime in the late 1930s. During the \"hollow years\" of the decade, the number of new conscripts declined because of the lack of births during World War I. From 1935 deaths exceeded births; the press widely discussed the country's decreasing population.

advocated for the \"protection of family and childhood\".[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cambodia | 675 (0.08) | 696 (0.09) | 629 (0.08) | 594 (0.08) | 632 (0.08) | 520 (0.07) | 496 (0.07) |
