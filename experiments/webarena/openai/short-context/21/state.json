These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top so for long listening it may hurt the ears. But not horrible. Sound was good! surprisingly so. not audiophile of course but decent. and a big step up from listening on notebook speakers. the built in mic I have yet to try and havent tried noise canceling which there doesn't appear to be a switch for so another negative. I think the better ones are 60 bucks and dont fold . so for some basics for travel these are good. I have a even tinier super light headphone thats bluetooth but not noise canceling for airplanes so my dec for these was def for airlines. I will report back after i fly.Loudness - these get VERY LOUD! Bass - These have excellent BASS Vocals - decent to good not audiophile. Listened to bowie ashes to ashes on amazon music and was quite balanced. Headphone sizing - bands CLICK to positions. very good. Plugging in the USB-B charger mini jack - a huge pain.

These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top so for long listening it may hurt the ears. But not horrible. Sound was good! surprisingly so. not audiophile of course but decent. and a big step up from listening on notebook speakers. the built in mic I have yet to try and havent tried noise canceling which there doesn't appear to be a switch for so another negative. I think the better ones are 60 bucks and dont fold . so for some basics for travel these are good. I have a even tinier super light headphone thats bluetooth but not noise canceling for airplanes so my dec for these was def for airlines. I will report back after i fly.Loudness - these get VERY LOUD! Bass - These have excellent BASS Vocals - decent to good not audiophile. Listened to bowie ashes to ashes on amazon music and was quite balanced. Headphone sizing - bands CLICK to positions. very good. Plugging in the USB-B charger mini jack - a huge pain. Has a micro SD slot. I think they would benefit from a audio graphic equalizer to rebalance.\"\n\t\t\t\t[5135] StaticText 'Review by '\n\t\t\t\t[5137] StaticText 'Anglebert Dinkherhump'\n\t\t\t\t[5141] StaticText 'Posted on '\n\t\t\t\t[4677] time ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[5143] StaticText '4/20/23'\nURL: http://onestopmarket.com/6s-wireless-headphones-over-ear-noise-canceling-hi-fi-bass-foldable-stereo-wireless-kid-headsets-earbuds-with-built-in-mic-micro-sd-tf-fm-for-iphone-samsung-ipad-pc-black-gold.html\nOBJECTIVE: BROWSER STATE:\nTab 0 (current): 6S Wireless Headphones Over Ear,Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Bass Foldable Stereo Wireless Kid Headsets Earbuds with Built-in Mic, Micro SD/TF, FM for iPhone/Samsung/iPad/PC (Black & Gold)\n\n[281] RootWebArea '6S Wireless Headphones Over Ear,Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Bass Foldable Stereo Wireless Kid Headsets Earbuds with Built-in Mic, Micro SD/TF, FM for iPhone/Samsung/iPad/PC (Black & Gold)' focused: True\n\t[279] generic '' busy: 1\n\t\t[277] main ''\n\t\t\t[1813] LayoutTable ''\n\t\t\t\t[1789] spinbutton 'Qty' required: False valuemin: 0 valuemax: 0 valuetext: \n\t\t\t\t[1801] button 'Add to Cart'\n\t\t\t[1828] link 'Add to Wish List'\n\t\t\t[1834] link 'Add to Compare'\n\t\t\t[2708] button 'Previous'\n\t\t\t[2710] generic 'Image'\n\t\t\t\t[2798] image 'Image'\n\t\t\t[2711] button 'Next'\n\t\t\t[2720] button 'Previous'\n\t\t\t[2782] button 'Image'\n\t\t\t\t[2801] image 'Image'\n\t\t\t[2784] button 'Image'\n\t\t\t\t[2799] image 'Image'\n\t\t\t[2724] button 'Next'\n\t\t\t[1864] link 'Skip to the beginning of the images gallery'\n\t\t\t[1988] tablist '' multiselectable: False orientation: horizontal\n\t\t\t\t[1878] tab 'Details' expanded: False selected: False controls: description\n\t\t\t\t\t[1876] link 'Details'\n\t\t\t\t[1983] tab 'Reviews (12)' expanded: True selected: True controls: reviews\n\t\t\t\t\t[1981] link 'Reviews (12)' focused: True\n\t\t\t\t[1516] tabpanel 'Reviews (12)'\n\t\t[1598] contentinfo ''\n\t\t\t[1557] button 'Subscribe'\n\t\t\t[1570] link 'Privacy and Cookie Policy'\n\t\t\t[1573] link 'Search Terms'\n\t\t\t[1576] link 'Advanced Search'\n\t\t\t[1579] link 'Contact Us'\n\t\t\t[1583] StaticText 'Copyright \u00a9 2013-present Magento, Inc.

Also, because they are so small, they tend to not be very comfortable to use for extended periods.\"\n\n2. **Reviewer: Anglebert Dinkherhump**\n   - **Date:** 4/20/23\n   - **Review:** \"These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top so for long listening it may hurt the ears.\"\n\nThese reviews indicate that the ear cups may be too small for adult ears and could cause discomfort during extended use.",
