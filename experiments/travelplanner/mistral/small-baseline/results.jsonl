This can involve considering factors that may not be captured by the data, such as cultural sensitivities, local customs, and hidden gems that may not be well-represented in online reviews or data sets.\n\nThe resulting travel plan should be a collaborative effort between data-driven insights and human expertise, resulting in a personalized and optimized itinerary that caters to the traveler's unique preferences and needs.\n\nBased on the provided information and preferences, here is a proposed 5-day travel itinerary for your group:\n\n**Day 1 (March 14, 2022):**\n- Departure from Salt Lake City to Houston\n- Accommodation: Sunny and Airy near Manhattan ($499.00 per night, 5.0 rating)\n- Attractions:\n  - Downtown Aquarium ($29.95 per person)\n  - Space Center Houston ($39.95 per person)\n\n**Day 2 (March 15, 2022):**\n- Transportation: Rental car ($50.00 per day)\n- Attractions:\n  - Houston Museum of Natural Science ($35.00 per person)\n  - Houston Zoo ($22.95 per person)\n- Dinner: Jalapenos (Average cost: $57.00 per person)\n\n**Day 3 (March 16, 2022):**\n- Attractions:\n  - The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston ($19.00 per person)\n  - Hermann Park (Free admission)\n- Lunch: Sheetla Dhaba (Average cost: $35.00 per person)\n\n**Day 4 (March 17, 2022):**\n- Attractions:\n  - Houston Arboretum & Nature Center (Free admission)\n  - Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens ($15.00 per person)\n- Dinner: Pebble Street (Average cost: $73.00 per person)\n\n**Day 5 (March 18, 2022):**\n- Departure from Houston to Dallas\n- Attractions:\n  - Dallas Museum of Art ($16.00 per person)\n  - Klyde Warren Park (Free admission)\n\nTotal estimated cost for the trip: $8,397.00 (including flights, accommodations, transportation, attractions, and meals)\n\nPlease review the proposed itinerary and let me know if you would like to make any changes or if there is any additional information you need.", "question": "Can you create a 5-day travel itinerary for me?
