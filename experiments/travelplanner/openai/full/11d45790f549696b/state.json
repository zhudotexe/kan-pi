Let's explore other transportation options and calculate the costs to ensure they fit within your budget. \n\nI'll look into self-driving and taxi options for traveling between Washington and Indiana, as well as between the cities in Indiana.\nIt seems there was an issue with retrieving the self-driving distance and cost information. Let me correct that and try again.\nIt appears there is a persistent issue with retrieving the self-driving distance and cost information. I will attempt to gather the information for each route individually to ensure accuracy. Let's start with the distance and cost from Washington to Indianapolis.\nIt seems there is a technical issue with retrieving the self-driving distance and cost information. As an alternative, I can provide an estimate based on general data and typical costs for such trips.\n\n### Estimated Costs and Distances:\n\n1. **Washington to Indianapolis:**\n   - Distance: Approximately 600 miles\n   - Estimated driving time: 9-10 hours\n   - Estimated cost (fuel, tolls, etc.): $300 - $400\n\n2. **Indianapolis to Evansville:**\n   - Distance: Approximately 170 miles\n   - Estimated driving time: 3 hours\n   - Estimated cost: $50 - $70\n\n3. **Evansville to South Bend:**\n   - Distance: Approximately 300 miles\n   - Estimated driving time: 5 hours\n   - Estimated cost: $100 - $150\n\n4. **South Bend to Fort Wayne:**\n   - Distance: Approximately 90 miles\n   - Estimated driving time: 1.5 hours\n   - Estimated cost: $30 - $50\n\n5. **Fort Wayne to Valparaiso:**\n   - Distance: Approximately 100 miles\n   - Estimated driving time: 2 hours\n   - Estimated cost: $30 - $50\n\n### Total Estimated Cost:\n- Washington to Indianapolis: $400\n- Indianapolis to Evansville: $70\n- Evansville to South Bend: $150\n- South Bend to Fort Wayne: $50\n- Fort Wayne to Valparaiso: $50\n\n**Total Estimated Cost for Self-Driving: $720**\n\nThis estimate is well within your budget of $23,800. If you prefer, I can also look into rental car options or other modes of transportation. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!",
