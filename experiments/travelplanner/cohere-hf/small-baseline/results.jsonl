Please note that I was unable to find a flight from Medford to Colorado, so I have included some suggested nearby airports for you to consider:\n\n\n## Day 1 - Denver, Colorado\n\nFly into Denver International Airport (DEN) and spend the first day exploring the city. Denver is a vibrant city with plenty of attractions, including the iconic Red Rocks Park and Amphitheatre, the Denver Art Museum, and the 16th Street Mall. You can also take a stroll through the historic Larimer Square and discover the city's culinary scene. \n\n## Day 2 - Colorado Springs\n\nHead south from Denver to Colorado Springs, a beautiful city nestled at the base of the Rocky Mountains. Colorado Springs offers stunning natural scenery and plenty of outdoor adventures. You can hike in the Garden of the Gods, drive through Pike National Forest, or visit the famous Seven Falls. The city also has a vibrant downtown area with great restaurants and shops. \n\n## Day 3 - Gunnison\n\nToday, you'll drive to Gunnison, a charming mountain town known for its gorgeous scenery and outdoor activities. Enjoy a scenic drive through the mountains and explore the Gunnison Valley. You can go snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, or snowmobiling in the winter, or hiking and mountain biking in the summer. Gunnison is also home to the scenic Curecanti National Recreation Area, offering opportunities for boating, fishing, and more. \n\n## Day 4 - Durango\n\nFrom Gunnison, make your way to Durango, a historic mining town with a rich past. Durango is known for its Old West charm and the famous Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, which offers scenic train rides through the mountains. You can also explore the Animas River Trail, visit the Durango Fish Hatchery, or take a drive to the San Juan National Forest for some breathtaking views. \n\n## Day 5 - Grand Junction\n\nGrand Junction is your next stop, a city known for its wine country and outdoor adventures. Explore the Colorado National Monument, a scenic canyon and desert landscape, or go on a wine-tasting tour at one of the many nearby wineries. You can also try your hand at rock climbing or take a leisurely bike ride along the Riverfront Trail. \n\n## Day 6 - Alamosa\n\nOn the sixth day, travel to Alamosa, a charming town located in the San Luis Valley.

Depending on the time of your flight, you may have time to explore another city or enjoy some last-minute adventures in Colorado before making your way to the airport. \n\n\n## Transportation and Accommodation\n\nFor flights, you can consider flying into Denver International Airport (DEN) and out of Colorado Springs Airport (COS) or Pueblo Memorial Airport (PUB), as they are the closest airports to Colorado Springs and provide convenient access to all the cities on your itinerary. Car rental is recommended for the duration of your trip, as it will allow you to explore at your own pace and reach all the destinations. \n\nAs for accommodation, here are some estimated costs for your trip:\n- Denver: $120 per night (hotel)\n- Colorado Springs: $100 per night (hotel)\n- Gunnison: $110 per night (hotel)\n- Durango: $90 per night (hotel)\n- Grand Junction: $80 per night (hotel)\n- Alamosa: $70 per night (hotel)\n\nThese are approximate costs and may vary depending on your specific choices and the time of booking. \n\nWith a budget of $2,400, you should have a comfortable trip, especially if you're traveling solo.
