I have chosen Key West and Miami as your destinations for this 5-day journey.\n\n\n## **Day 1 - Key West**\n\n### Travel\nYou can fly to Key West from Cleveland on 2nd March with a layover in Atlanta or Charlotte. The flight will cost $599.75 per person. The journey time is approximately 5 hours and 15 minutes, including the layover.\n\n### Accommodation\nAs you are a group of 6 with pets, I recommend the Pet-Friendly 3BD Key West House. This accommodation is a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house with a private pool, located near the beach. The cost is $2,000 for the 5 nights, which is $333.33 per person for the whole group.\n\n### Food\nDine at El Siboney, a Cuban restaurant located in Old Town Key West, offering traditional Cuban dishes and a vibrant atmosphere. \n\n### Attractions\nExplore the Key West Lighthouse and Keeper's Quarters Museum, which showcases the history of the iconic lighthouse and has a beautiful garden. You could also check out the Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory, a peaceful garden filled with tropical plants and hundreds of colorful butterflies.\n\n\n## **Day 2 - Key West**\n\nYou could spend the second day relaxing and enjoying the facilities at your accommodation, or you might like to take a dolphin tour where you can swim with dolphins and learn about these fascinating creatures. \n\n\n## **Day 3 - Miami**\n\n### Travel\nOn the morning of March 4th, you can take a flight from Key West to Miami, which takes around 1 hour and costs $129.49 per person. \n\n### Accommodation\nFor your Miami stay, I recommend the Miami Beach Pet-Friendly Guest House, a 3-bedroom house with a pool and a garden, located just 10 minutes from the beach. The cost for 2 nights is $1,199, which is $200 per person. \n\n### Food\nHead to Joe's Stone Crab for a fancy dinner. This iconic restaurant has been serving stone crabs and other seafood dishes since 1913. \n\n### Attractions\nVisit the iconic South Beach, a beautiful stretch of white sand and clear waters. You could also explore the Miami Beach Botanical Garden, a tranquil oasis with tropical plants and tranquil ponds. \n\n\n## **Day 4 - Miami**\n\nOn the fourth day, you could take a day trip to Everglades National Park, a vast area of wetlands and wildlife. There are many exciting tours and activities available, such as airboat rides and wildlife shows. \n\n\n## **Day 5 - Miami**\n\nFor your final day, you could visit the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, an impressive Italian Renaissance-style villa with beautiful gardens and a museum showcasing historical art and artifacts. Alternatively, you might like to check out the Miami Design District, filled with unique stores and galleries. \n\n### Travel Home\nYou can fly back to Cleveland from Miami on the evening of March 6th. The flight costs $184.79 per person and has a layover in Charlotte, with a total journey time of 4 hours and 15 minutes. \n\nThe total cost for the trip is $3,703.20 per person, which is within your budget and takes into account the flights, accommodation, and transport between cities.
