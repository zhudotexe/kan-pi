This itinerary assumes you are able to find available flights for your desired dates. Please note that the budget and accommodation options may require adjustments based on real-time availability and price fluctuations. \n\n**Day 1 - March 25th**\n- Fly to San Francisco from Salt Lake City.\n- Check into a private room at the Red Roof Inn San Francisco Airport, with smoking rooms available.
