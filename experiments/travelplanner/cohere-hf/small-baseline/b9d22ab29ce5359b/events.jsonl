Alternatively, Bhola Dhaba is a good option for Mediterranean cuisine with an average cost of $65 and a rating of 2.8. \n\n**Day 2: Exploring Houston**\n\n**Morning:**\nStart your day at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, located at 5555 Hermann Park Dr. Here, you can explore various exhibits and learn about natural history and science. \n\n**Afternoon:**\nAfter the museum, head over to the Houston Zoo, which is nearby at 6200 Hermann Park Dr. Spend some time enjoying the diverse wildlife and beautiful surroundings. \n\n**Evening:**\nFor dinner, try Earthen Spices for some Mexican and BBQ options with an average cost of $28 and a rating of 2.7. Or, if you're in the mood for Italian, consider Truth Coffee, which has an average cost of $29 and a rating of 4.4. \n\n**Day 3: More Houston Attractions**\n\n**Morning:**\nBegin your last day in Houston by visiting The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, located at 1001 Bissonnet St. This museum showcases a range of art and cultural exhibits. \n\n**Afternoon:**\nAfter the museum, take a stroll through the beautiful Hermann Park, which is right next door. You can relax in the park, enjoy a picnic, or explore the various attractions within it, such as the Pioneer Memorial Obelisk. \n\n**Evening:**\nFor your last dinner in Houston, consider Super Bakery, which has an average cost of $30 and serves seafood and fast food with a rating of 3.3. Another option is Jalapenos, offering Chinese and seafood with an average cost of $57 and a rating of 4.2. \n\n**Travel Home:**\nOn March 23rd, you can return home with a flight back to Santa Ana. \n\nI recommend booking your flights, accommodation, and making restaurant reservations to ensure a smooth trip.
