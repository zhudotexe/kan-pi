It might be best to stick to two cities in the same region for this short trip. With that in mind, I suggest the following 5-day itinerary:\n\n## Day 1 (March 11th)\n- Travel from Cedar Rapids to Austin, Texas. This is a 925-mile drive, so I recommend splitting it into two days. You will need to leave early in the day to make the drive comfortable.\n- Stop halfway in either Wichita, Kansas, or Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for the night. There are plenty of accommodation options in both cities with a range of budgets, and you can get a good night's rest before continuing your journey.\n\n## Day 2 (March 12th)\n- After a night's rest, continue your journey to Austin, Texas. You should arrive early afternoon, leaving you with plenty of time to explore.\n- Check into your accommodation. The Heywood Hotel is a highly-rated boutique hotel that allows visitors and is located in the heart of the city. It offers a unique experience with its eclectic decor and modern amenities. The cost for two people for two nights is approximately $500.\n- For dinner, I recommend 'Vina Enoteca', a highly-rated restaurant serving Mediterranean cuisine with a focus on fresh ingredients.\n\n## Day 3 (March 13th)\n- Start your day at the Texas State Capitol. This iconic building offers tours where you can learn about the history and architecture of this significant government landmark.\n- Visit the Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trail. This beautiful trail along the lake offers a peaceful escape in the heart of the city. You can rent bikes or simply walk and enjoy the views.\n- For lunch, head to 'Wu Chow'. This restaurant serves authentic Chinese cuisine and has a vibrant atmosphere.\n- In the afternoon, explore the South Congress Avenue Historic District, known for its unique shops, art galleries, and vibrant street art.\n- For dinner, 'The Peached Tortilla' is a great option, offering a fusion of Southern comfort food and Asian flavours.\n\n## Day 4 (March 14th)\n- Travel from Austin to San Antonio, a journey of approximately 80 miles.\n- Check into your accommodation at the Mokara Hotel & Spa, a luxurious property located on the famous River Walk. The hotel offers elegant rooms, a spa, and an outdoor pool. The cost for one night is around $350.\n- Spend the afternoon exploring the San Antonio River Walk, a picturesque network of walkways along the river, lined with shops, restaurants, and beautiful landscapes.\n- For dinner, 'Bohanan's Prime Steak and Seafood' serves high-quality steaks and fresh seafood in a refined atmosphere.\n\n## Day 5 (March 15th)\n- Visit the Alamo, a historic mission and fortress known for its role in Texas history. Guided tours are available to learn more about its significance.\n- Head to Market Square, a vibrant outdoor market with various shops, food vendors, and a lively atmosphere. Here you can also enjoy a variety of international cuisines, including Mediterranean, Indian, and Italian.\n- Visit the San Antonio Museum of Art, which houses a diverse collection of artworks from various cultures and time periods.\n- For your final dinner in Texas, 'India Palace' is an excellent choice for authentic Indian cuisine and a great way to end your culinary journey.\n\nYour total estimated accommodation cost for this trip is $850, well within your budget. This itinerary provides a mix of history, outdoor activities, and culinary experiences, ensuring you get a taste of Texas culture. It is best to check and book your accommodations and restaurants in advance to secure availability.\n\nPlease note that this travel plan is based on the information available to me up to January 2023.","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[],"is_tool_call_error":null}}
