Based on your requirements, it's the only available accommodation that suits your needs in Pittsburgh. A 10-minute drive from your accommodation, you'll find the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, which is home to over 4,000 animals and offers a range of exhibits and shows.\n- Head to the Burger Factory for lunch. This restaurant serves American cuisine and scores highly for Italian, Chinese and BBQ dishes.\n- In the afternoon, you can visit the National Aviary, a short walk from the burger restaurant. This is a unique indoor, bird-watching experience.\n- For dinner, you could try the Maharaja Bhog, a café serving various cuisines, including pizza and Chinese dishes.\n\n## Day 2: March 14th\n- Start the day with a visit to the Carnegie Museum of Art, a 9-minute drive from your accommodation. Here, you can explore various art movements, including the work of local artists.\n- For lunch, I recommend the Green Chick Chop, a walkable distance from the museum. This café serves French cuisine and has a 4.1-star rating.\n- Next, try the Onyz Bar - Hotel The Royal Plaza, also a short walk away. This bar serves a range of food options, including Mexican and pizza.\n- Finish the day with a visit to Point State Park, which can be done on foot from the bar. This park is a great place to relax and offers a beautiful view of the Pittsburgh skyline.\n\n## Day 3: March 15th\n- In the morning, take a 1-hour drive to Buffalo, New York. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any accommodation in Buffalo that allows visitors and has good reviews. However, you can stay in the Sunny + Spacious Master Bedroom with Outdoor Deck, which is a 15-minute drive from Buffalo.\n- For lunch, visit Beijing Café, a 10-minute drive from your accommodation. This restaurant serves a range of cuisines, including Mexican, Indian and pizza.\n- In the afternoon, you could visit the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens, a 13-minute drive from the restaurant. This attraction features a variety of gardens and conservatories, showcasing beautiful plant life.\n- For dinner, I suggest Seasons 52 Fresh Grill, a 7-minute drive from the garden. This restaurant specialises in seafood and Italian cuisine and has a 4.4-star rating.\n\n## Day 4: March 16th\n- Make a 2-hour drive to Islip, New York. I found no accommodation in Islip that allows visitors and has decent reviews. However, you can stay in the Versatile private room in Harlem/Hamilton Heights, which is a 50-minute drive away.\n- For lunch, I recommend you try a 15-minute drive to Green Chick Chop. This café serves French cuisine and has a 3.3-star rating.\n- In the afternoon, you could visit the American Airpower Museum, about a 10-minute drive from the café. This museum showcases military aircraft and offers interactive exhibits.\n- For dinner, Lord of the Drinks Forum is a good option, a 14-minute drive from the museum. This restaurant serves a range of cuisines, including Chinese, Indian and pizza.\n\n## Day 5: March 17th\n- Drive 3.5 hours to New York City. Here, you can stay at the Beautiful and big 1BR sublet close by Central Park, which allows visitors and has a 5-star rating.\n- For lunch, I suggest Seasons 52 Fresh Grill, a 10-minute drive from your accommodation. This restaurant specialises in seafood and Italian cuisine.\n- In the afternoon, visit the Guggenheim Museum, a 14-minute drive from the restaurant. This art museum features a vast collection of modern and contemporary art, including paintings, sculptures and photographs.\n- For dinner, try Goosebumps, a 13-minute drive from the museum. This restaurant offers Chinese, pizza and bakery dishes.\n\n## Day 6: March 18th\n- Spend the day in New York City.\n- For lunch, QD's Restaurant is a good choice, a 20-minute drive from your accommodation. This restaurant serves a range of cuisines, including Indian and BBQ dishes.\n- In the afternoon, you could visit the Brooklyn Bridge, about a 15-minute drive from the restaurant. This iconic landmark is a popular tourist attraction, offering breathtaking views and a unique architectural experience.\n- For dinner, I recommend Amchur, a 16-minute drive from the bridge. This restaurant serves tea and American cuisine.\n\n## Day 7: March 19th\n- Depart New York.\n\nI only found a few accommodation options that allow visitors in the cities you're visiting, and I couldn't find any restaurants that specifically serve French or Italian cuisine in New York. For this reason, I've recommended restaurants that serve a range of cuisines, including French and Italian.","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[],"is_tool_call_error":null}}
