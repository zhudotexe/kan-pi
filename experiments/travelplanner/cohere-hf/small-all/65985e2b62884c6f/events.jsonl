Here's a suggested itinerary for a 7-day trip to Texas from Palm Springs, considering budget and spacing between cities: \n\n1. Day 1-2: Houston, TX\nHouston is a vibrant city with a range of attractions, including the Space Center Houston, museums, and a lively theater and music scene. You can visit the Houston Zoo, the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, or take a stroll through the historic Houston Heights neighborhood. \n\n2. Day 3-4: Austin, TX\nFrom Houston, you can drive to Austin in about 2-3 hours, depending on traffic. Austin is known for its live music scene, unique culture, and beautiful natural surroundings. Visit the Lady Bird Lake, enjoy live music at Sixth Street, and explore the University of Texas at Austin campus. \n\n3. Day 5-6: Dallas, TX\nDallas is approximately a 3-hour drive from Austin. It's a fantastic city with a rich history, art, and architecture. You can visit the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, explore the Dallas Arts District, or take a stroll through the historic West End Historic District. \n\nFor transportation between these cities, you can consider renting a car, which offers flexibility and convenience for exploring each destination at your own pace. Alternatively, you can take buses or trains, which may be more budget-friendly but might require more planning and time. \n\nPlease note that the exact travel times and distances may vary, and it's always a good idea to check for any potential delays or road conditions before your trip.","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[],"is_tool_call_error":null}}
