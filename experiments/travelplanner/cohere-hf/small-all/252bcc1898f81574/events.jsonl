For this trip, I suggest visiting **Newark** and **Atlantic City**. These cities offer a mix of urban attractions, natural beauty, and a vibrant cultural scene. \n\n## Itinerary\n\n**Day 1 (March 6th)**:\n- Arrive in Newark and check into your accommodation. I found some great options in the downtown area with prices starting at $150 per night. \n- Spend the afternoon exploring the Newark Museum of Art, which boasts an impressive collection of American art and international collections. Entry is around $18 for adults.\n- For dinner, try the highly-rated Italian restaurant, Casa Vasca, offering traditional Italian dishes with a twist. Mains start at $23.\n\n**Day 2 (March 7th)**:\n- Start your day with a visit to Branch Brook Park, a beautiful urban park known for its cherry blossom festival in spring. \n- After a leisurely morning, head to the Prudential Center for some indoor ice skating or catch a hockey game if you're lucky! Tickets start at $20.\n- For lunch, indulge in some delicious Mexican cuisine at Diablo's Mexican Kitchen. Their tacos and margaritas are a must-try!\n- In the evening, take a stroll through the Ironbound neighborhood, known for its vibrant Portuguese and Brazilian culture. \n\n**Day 3 (March 8th)**:\n- Travel to Atlantic City by bus or train. The journey takes around 2 hours and costs approximately $20-$30 one way.\n- Check into your accommodation, with prices starting at $120 per night for a comfortable stay.\n- Spend the afternoon at the renowned Atlantic City Boardwalk, a 5-mile stretch of fun and entertainment. Enjoy the beach, arcades, and unique shops.\n- For dinner, try the famous White House Sub Shop, known for its delicious subs and casual atmosphere.\n\n**Day 4 (March 9th)**:\n- Visit the Atlantic City Aquarium, home to over 200 species of marine life. Tickets are around $20 for adults. \n- In the afternoon, take a stroll along the beach and enjoy the fresh sea breeze. \n- For a unique dining experience, book a table at Dock's Oyster House, an iconic seafood restaurant with a rich history and delicious menu. Mains start at $25.\n\n**Day 5 (March 10th)**:\n- On your last day, explore the Atlantic City Art Center, which showcases local and regional art. \n- Before your departure, grab a quick bite at one of the many casual dining options along the Boardwalk. \n\n## Transportation and Costs\n\nI couldn't find specific flight details from Charlotte to Newark, but I can help you book those when the dates get closer. As for internal travel, you can take the bus or train between Newark and Atlantic City, and within the cities, consider using ride-sharing apps or public transport. \n\nLet me know if you would like me to provide more detailed information on any of these suggestions or if you want to adjust the itinerary to better suit your preferences!","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[],"is_tool_call_error":null}}
