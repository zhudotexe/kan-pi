However, I have found suitable accommodations in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Lafayette. Here is a suggested itinerary for your 7-day trip to Louisiana, starting on March 8th:\n\n## Day 1:\n- Arrive in New Orleans and check into 'Conveniently located private room in Brooklyn' ($172 per night). The room is in a private apartment, and you'll have the space to yourselves.\n- Spend the afternoon exploring the city, perhaps visiting the French Quarter or strolling along the Mississippi River.\n\n## Day 2:\n- After breakfast, head to the Garden District for a morning of sightseeing.
