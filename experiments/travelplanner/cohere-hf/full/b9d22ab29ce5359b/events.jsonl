The restaurant is known for its pizza, desserts, bakery items, and more. The average cost is $35 for a meal.\n- Afternoon Activity: Immerse yourself in local culture at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Explore the museum's exhibits and learn about the natural world, with a focus on Texas and the Gulf Coast.\n- Dinner: Experience authentic Italian cuisine at 'Vinayaka Mylari'.

However, Houston has a well-developed public transport system, including buses and the METRORail light rail. You can use these to navigate the city, and I recommend checking local transport apps or websites for real-time schedules and routes during your trip.\n\nThis itinerary provides a mix of culinary experiences and attractions within your budget of $3,000.
