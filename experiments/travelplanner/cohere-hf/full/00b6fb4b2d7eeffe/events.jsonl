Try 'Veracruz All Natural' for delicious Mexican tacos or 'East Side King' for Asian-fusion street food.\n- **Nightlife:** Austin is known for its music scene; catch a show at venues like The Continental Club or Stubb's BBQ for some live music and dancing.\n\n## Day 5: Austin to San Antonio\n- **Travel and Sightseeing:** Begin your journey to San Antonio, a 90-mile drive that takes roughly 1.5 hours.
