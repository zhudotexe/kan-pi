Here are some ideas for a future trip, including three Texan cities you might like to visit:\n\n## Day 1 - 3: Austin\nNicknamed the 'Live Music Capital of the World', Austin is known for its vibrant culture and nightlife. Here are some suggestions for your stay:\n- **Getting there:** As a starting point, you could fly from Billings to Austin International Airport (AUS). Rental car services, such as Avis and Enterprise, are available at the airport for easy access to the city.\n- **Accommodation:** Consider staying at the Lone Star Court, a boutique hotel located in the Domain area, offering a unique 'retro-cool' experience.\n- **Day 1:** Start your day with breakfast at the famous Austin java spot, Mozarts Coffee Roasters. Visit the Texas State Capitol and explore the beautiful grounds. For lunch, enjoy authentic Mexican cuisine at Vera Cruz Taco House.
