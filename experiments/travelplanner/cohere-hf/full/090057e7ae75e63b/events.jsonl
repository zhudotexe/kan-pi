Enjoy dishes like the Sweet Potato Pancakes or the Cajun Eggs Benedict.\n- **US Space and Rocket Center:** A must-visit attraction in Huntsville is the space centre. Explore space exhibits, see rockets up close, and experience interactive displays. Admission is $25 per person.\n- **Lunch at Po Boy Factory:** Sample some Louisiana-style cuisine at this local gem. Their Po' Boys and seafood dishes are highly recommended.\n- **Huntsville Botanical Garden:** In the afternoon, stroll through the beautiful botanical gardens.
