The flight price is $258 and the duration is 2 hours and 5 minutes.\n- Check into your accommodation. I suggest a cosy 1-bedroom apartment in the heart of Fort Greene, which will cost $751 for 3 nights.\n- In the evening, enjoy dinner at Vapour Pub & Brewery, a French-influenced restaurant with a local twist, offering BBQ, fast food, cafe, and seafood dishes. The average cost is $80.\n\n## Day 2 (March 5th):\n- Explore Detroit's cultural highlights, such as the Detroit Institute of Arts, Motown Museum, and the Detroit Zoo.\n- For lunch, try the popular Chye Seng Huat Hardware for a unique dining experience with a variety of cuisines (average cost: $94).\n- In the afternoon, visit the Eastern Market, a bustling marketplace with local produce and crafts.\n- For dinner, head to Aapki Rasoi for a mix of Mediterranean, desserts, and seafood (average cost: $21).\n\n## Day 3 (March 6th):\n- Spend the day at Belle Isle Park, a beautiful urban park with gardens, a conservatory, and a nature centre.\n- Enjoy a picnic in the park with treats from Southern Bliss Bakery, offering a range of desserts, seafood, and BBQ options (average cost: $28).\n- Visit the Detroit Riverfront, take a stroll along the river, and watch the sunset.\n\n## Day 4 (March 7th):\n- Travel to Grand Rapids. There are multiple flights available, with prices ranging from $30 to $53 and flight times around 40-50 minutes.\n- Upon arrival, check into your accommodation. A good option is the Noel Palace, a private room priced at $147 for 2 nights, with a minimum stay of 3 nights.\n- Freshen up and head to Paribar for dinner, a French-inspired restaurant offering BBQ and seafood (average cost: $54).\n\n## Day 5 (March 8th):\n- Start your day at the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, a beautiful outdoor space with gardens and sculpture displays.\n- Visit the Grand Rapids Public Museum to learn about the city's history.\n- For lunch, try Deli 63, offering a blend of American and Indian cuisines (average cost: $41).\n- Explore the Downtown Market, a vibrant market with local produce, crafts, and food stalls.\n- End your day with a visit to the Van Andel Arena to catch a concert or sporting event.\n\n## Day 6 (March 9th):\n- Make your way to Bay City. I cannot provide flight information, but you can explore options like train or bus travel.\n- Check into a hotel or Airbnb in Bay City.\n- Enjoy a leisurely walk along the Saginaw Riverfront, taking in the scenic views.\n- Have dinner at a local restaurant, such as the Riverfront Grille, offering American cuisine with a view of the river (average cost: $40).\n\n## Day 7 (March 10th):\n- Visit the Bay City State Park and enjoy outdoor activities like hiking or birdwatching.\n- Stop by the Bay City Town Center for shopping and entertainment.\n- On your way back to Detroit, make a stop at the Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, a famous Christmas-themed attraction.\n\n---\n\nThis itinerary provides a mix of cultural, culinary, and outdoor experiences in Detroit and Grand Rapids, with a focus on French and American cuisines.
