There are also plenty of other activities to get involved with, such as:\n- Visiting the State Capitol building, completed in 1888, to learn about Texas' political history.\n- Hiking the Barton Creek Greenbelt, a 7.9-mile trail with 147-foot limestone cliffs and natural swimming pools.\n- Taking a dip in Barton Springs Pool, a 1000-foot long public swimming pool filled with water from nearby natural springs.\n- Checking out the famous 6th Street and Red River entertainment districts for live music and nightlife.\n\n## Houston\nHouston is home to NASA's Johnson Space Center, which is a must-see for any space enthusiasts. This city also has a vibrant food scene and some unique attractions:\n- Touring the Johnson Space Center, where you can see space artefacts, rocket exhibits, and even meet astronauts.\n- Visiting the Houston Zoo, one of the best in the US, spanning 55 acres and housing over 6000 animals.\n- Exploring the Downtown Aquarium, featuring a Ferris wheel, carnival games, and a white tiger exhibit.\n- Tasting the local cuisine at the Original Ninfa's on Navigation, a classic Houston Tex-Mex restaurant.\n\nWith a budget of $12,000, you could book a combination of hotels, Airbnb rentals, and vacation rentals for your group of eight people. Many accommodations in Austin and Houston have 'visitor-friendly' house rules, allowing you to host get-togethers or small events with prior approval.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to suggest more cities or provide accommodation options within your budget, and I'll be happy to assist!","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[],"is_tool_call_error":null}}
